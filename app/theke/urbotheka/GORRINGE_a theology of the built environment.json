    "content": "A THEOLOGY OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT Justice, Empowerment, Redemption T. J. GORRINGE Preface For nearly a millennium and a half after Aristotle, economics was understood as a sub discipline of ethics. In the nineteenth century this connection was severed, with disastrous consequences for both people and planet from which we are only just beginning to retrieve ourselves. The case was not so bad for architecture and town planning, though even here brutalist and technocratic understandings of the human spread their poison almost everywhere. Wittingly or unwittingly every design for council estates, every barrio, every skyscraper, every out of town supermarket, expresses a view of the human, embodies an ethic. As I have noted in another context, ethics is the conversation of the human race about its common project, about where it is going and why it wants to go there. There are life affirming, but there have also been many life denying, ethical systems. Recognising this, the authors of Deuteronomy called their fellow countrymen to choose between two ways, a way of life and a way of death. We know only too well that there are ways of life and of death in the built environment. Though they certainly did not get everything right, the authors of Deuteronomy took their stand on belief in the liberating power of the God of life. Five hundred years after they wrote Jesus of Nazareth endorsed that stand. Reflecting on what he stood for, John put into his mouth the words: \u2018I am come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.\u2019 Christianity, and therefore theology, has to be concerned with architecture and town planning because it seeks life in all its fullness. No theology can dialogue solely with its own tradition, solely with other theologians. I have learned hugely from John Turner, Colin Ward, Nicholas Habraken, Christopher Day, David Harvey, whose class on Capital I was part of in Oxford, Richard Sennett, Peter Hall and Lewis Mumford. Mumford\u2019s contribution in particular calls for reassessment, for he wrote as a unique kind of ethicist, centrally concerned with the built environment and, as Rudolf Bahro noted, he was a genuinely prophetic figure. It is imperative Christians learn from him. This book began with an invitation to address religious education teachers on the ethics of the built environment, and the material in it has been shared with clergy and laity in Britain, Germany, Norway and Canada. Whatever its inadequacies, I have found people eagerly engaged with the theme, and I am grateful for the many challenges these audiences provided. Iona Gorringe has been a constant companion in reflecting on the built environment on countless journeys in Scotland and England, and her enthusiasm for the project has always been profoundly encouraging. Readers will quickly become aware of my debt to Hugo Gorringe, and in particular his work on the constructed space of Dalit communities in South India. He has kept me supplied with a constant supply of relevant articles. I am grateful for Kevin Taylor\u2019s faith in the project at Cambridge, and also to Norman Shanks, for allowing me to offer this piece of work as my Mainland Project for membership of the Iona Community. The book was begun in Dundee and finished in Exeter. Here Arthur Hannabuss and John Escott have exemplified the unpretentiousness and skill of vernacular building which I urge as, in part, an answer to our present discontents. No two people could make clearer both the limits of what conventionally we call \u2018education\u2019, and the profundity of a true education, the product of countless generations of skill, commonsense and craftsmanship. Without them the book could quite literally not have been written, as there would have been no roof under which to write it. The book is dedicated with affection to an architect and a drama teacher and theologian who are a source of inspiration in this area as in others. TIM GORRINGE Exeter Feast of St Benedict 2001 The theology of the built environment Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart... write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. (Deuteronomy 6.6 9) To be human is to be placed: to be born in this house, hospital, stable (according to Luke), or even, as in the floods in Mozambique in 2000, in a tree. It is to live in this council house, semi detached, tower block, farmhouse, mansion. It is to go to school through these streets or lanes, to play in this alley, park, garden; to shop in this market, that mall; to work in this factory, mine, office, farm. These facts are banal, but they form the fabric of our everyday lives, structuring our memories, determining our attitudes. How, as Christians, should we think of them? Are they a proper subject for theological reflection? Here and there great theologians, notably Aquinas and Calvin, have glanced in this direction, but the built environment forms no kcus in theological ethics except insofar as it has dealt with land and property, and with the city as a metaphor for community, or our final destination.1 It is in ethics that theology has engaged with the concrete \u2014 with war, economics, work, sexuality. Why not, then, with the built environment? We are invited to do that by the very terminology involved. Paul constantly urges his congregations to \u2018edify\u2019 one another. The word \u2018edify\u2019 comes from the Latin aedificare, to build.2 The metaphorical use of the word points to a profound truth about the built environment. Form follows function; buildings serve a purpose. For good or ill buildings, from the humblest garden shed to the grandest cathedral, make moral statements. Learning from Barth, I take it for granted that for the theologian ethics and dogmatics cannot be separated. They are continuous sections 1 Land is the theme of the third chapter, and the city of the sixth. 2 A point made by K. Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), p. 11. The Greek word Paul uses, oikodomeo, has the same literal and metaphorical meaning. on the theological railway, not a main line (dogmatics) and a branch line (ethics). In that case, what is called for is a theological reading of the built environment. This will differ from other ethical accounts in its reference to a primarily narrative frame. Like teleological ethics, it will raise the question of the purpose of our building and planning; it will always ask about context, and to this extent resemble situation ethics; in the ongoing debate which constitutes church life it will seek to discern the command of God in this area as in others; in all cases it will be concerned with the way in which the built environment furthers human virtue or destroys it. But in each case it will do so in reference to the narratives which give us our account of the Triune God: the stories of creation, reconciliation, redemption. To the question, \u2018Where do we find the measure of the validity of a given form of architecture or planning?\u2019 it will reply precisely in these narratives and their explication.1 The point of this is not, of course, to teach planners and architects what to do. As Hans Urs von Balthasar has said, \u2018Christianity has no direct competence in the realm of worldly structures.\u2019 This has not prevented theologians from drawing up quite precise guidelines for economic structures, as in the theories of the \u2018just price\u2019 and the \u2018just wage\u2019 and in Catholic Social Teaching, or for armed combat, as in the so called just war theory\u2019. These theories follow, because, as von Balthasar goes on, the gospel \u2018sends Christians into the world with an image of the human whereby and according to which they are to organise its structures as responsibly as they can\u2019.2 Perhaps this is still to state the matter too ecclesiocentrically. In his work in Finnish cities Seppo Kjellberg has sought to understand theology as a science of reconciliation, promoting interdisciplinary dialogue, bringing all concerned with questions of the built environment together, but offering as its own perspective an understanding of the overall purpose of humankind within creation.3 We can accept this if we understand \u2018reconciliation\u2019 in Barth\u2019s sense, as the vivifying and revolutionary action of God within human community seeking the realisation of life in all its fullness for all people. If \u2018reconciliation\u2019 meant the Church adopting a managerial role, \u2018mediating\u2019 between rich and poor, bosses and workers, oppressors and oppressed, pouring the oil of middle axioms on the troubled waters of social conflict, it would certainly be untrue to the gospel. Christianity brings to all debates about 1 Ibid., p. 12. 2 H. Urs von Balthasar, \u2018Liberation Theology in the Light of Salvation History\u2019 inj. V.

Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheology (Utrecht: International Books, 2000), p. 26. the structures of the world through which we reproduce ourselves economics, social and criminal justice, but also town planning and building its understanding of God become flesh, \u2018whereby and according to which\u2019, as von Balthasar says, they build. In view of the silence of the tradition it is essential to insist that Christian theology has at its core a vision of the human which is especially pertinent to the built environment. In his Ten Books of Architecture, written in the first century bc, the Roman architect and engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio gave a description of the geometry of the human body which formulated the principles of classical architecture, rediscovered and taken up again at the Renaissance.1 For many centuries this perception provided the ground rules for an architectural practice which was by definition humanist, which sought and built according to human scale. For Vitruvius, in fact, we become human only as we build.2 In the twentieth century another architect, Rudolph Schwartz, who regarded ethics as determinative for architecture, gave further expression to this principle.3 Building, he said, is done with the whole body, so that it is the movements of the body which create living space. What then comes into being is first and foremost circumscribed space shelter, living space, ceremonial space, a space which replaces the space of the world. We could almost say, and indeed it is true, that building is based on the inner spaciousness of the body, on dre knowledge of its extent and the form of its growth, on the knowledge of its articulation and of its power to expand. Indeed it is with the body that we experience building, with the outstretched arms and the pacing feet, with the roving glance and with the ear, and above all else in breathing. Space is dancingly experienced.4 1 The passage runs: \u2018For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.\u2019 Vitruvius, The Ten Books of Architecture, tr. M. Morgan, (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1914.), p. 73. Leonardo produced a classical illustration of this claim. See on this the excellent discussion in M. J. Ostwald and R. John Moore, Disjecta Membra: The Architect, The Serial Killer ; His Victim and Her Medical Examiner ( Sydney: Arcadia Press, 1998). 2 Vitruvius, Ten Books, Book 2, ch. 1, p. 38. 3 4 R. Schwartz, The Church Incarnate (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1958), p. 27 (my italics). This is a profound expression of the Vitruvian view, though the conclusion is more of an eschatological hope than a lived reality. In the twentieth century such humanist architecture was more the exception than the rule, as this kind of humanism was discarded in favour of a brutalist technocracy for which \u2018man\u2019 was a \u2018machine\u2019 and buildings, accordingly, \u2018machines for living in\u2019.10 At the same time, from Patrick Geddes onwards, sociologists have seen that if utopia cannot be produced by building better, at least the reverse is true, that there are environments which generate crime and physical and mental ill health.11 Balthasar is right: in relation to the built environment the recovery of a new humanism is an urgent need, and in this Christian theology, as one dialogue partner amongst many, certainly has a role to play. Kjellberg, however, points out that the anthropocentrism of earlier Christian theology is inadequate. What is needed is what he calls a \u2018cosmological holism\u2019, which understands creation and incarnation, doctrine and ethics, together.12 Balthasar is right that the church\u2019s involvement in the city was always based on the doctrine of the incarnation, the idea of the \u2018humanity of God\u2019.13 However, he seems to have forgotten what otherwise he has learned from Barth, that there is no theological assertion without its ethical correlate. It is not just Christian anthropology which determines our activity, but all the propositions of the creed. Christian faith brings the whole Trinitarian economy of creation, reconciliation and redemption to its rflection on the world. I shall, therefore, be attempting a Trinitarian reflection in what follows. A Trinitarian theological ethic will also, I shall argue, be a theology of grace, and for that very reason a theology of liberation. Barth gave his entire Dogmatics a Trinitarian structure. He had, therefore, an ethics of creation, and planned an ethics of reconciliation and of 10 The slogan of Le Corbusier. On these grounds Harries notes that it is possible to charge modernism with moral failure. Function, p. 9. 11 See further on this the discussion in chapter 7. 12 Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheobgy, p. 17. I cannot agree with Elaine Graham\u2019s criticism of the incarnational theology of Faith in the City as the perfect expression of\u2018the Church of England\u2019s position in a settled, harmonious social order\u2019 (\u2018Theology in the City: Ten Years after Faith in the City\\ Bulletin of the John Rylands Library 78.1, 1996, p. 184). Incarnation can be an expression of the status quo, but for the Christian socialist tradition in which the Report stands it was always a reminder that God identified with the poor, and that justice demanded concrete, and more egalitarian, expression. Harvey notes that the socialist utopian literature of the nineteenth century contains a \u2018powerful and important critical element\u2019 ( Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 195). The same applies to the views of the incarnation. To appeal to the incarnation as the ground of a humanist architecture is queried by both Schopenhauer, who criticised the Christian aspiration to vertically, as opposed to the horizontal which stays close to the earth, and by Bloch who contrasts Greek corporeal humane proportions with Christian otherworldly ones (The Principle of Hope (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 716). But the incarnation, which begins with a story set in a cow shed, is precisely what announces a this worldly intention. redemption. Different aspects of human life were grouped by him under these headings. For example, he dealt with the relations of women and men, with work, with respect for life, under \u2018creation\u2019. As that which forms our \u2018third skin\u2019, however, I want to argue that the built environment relates to every area of Christian ethics, and that only a Trinitarian ethic, an ethic of creation, reconciliation, and redemption, is adequate to explore it. It is a fundamental principle of Trinitarian theology that opera Trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt: the works of God cannot be divided. If it is God who acts, it is God who acts, not \u2018parts\u2019 of God, for God is indivisible. At the same time the Church has always spoken of\u2018appropriations\u2019, whereby we speak of some forms of divine activity more especially in terms of one person of the Trinity than another. In relation to the built environment we can say that God the Creator is the one who brings order out of chaos, and is therefore the source of all order and of the planning which gives form to our world. The perspective of creation points us away from the anthropocentric city to one in which the wider ecology is fundamentally respected. God the Reconciler is the one who \u2018breaks down the walls of partition\u2019 both between God and humans and between humans themselves. God is therefore the source of all attempts to realise community and of the justice without which community cannot survive. God the Redeemer is the author of all dreams and visions, the author of the imagination which seeks the new Jerusalem and anticipates it in structures here and now. One or other of these \u2018appropriations\u2019 lies behind my attempt to think through the question of the built environment theologically in each of the chapters that follow. I speak here of God, the origin and end of good which is to say, creative, reconciling, redeeming human action. A major strand of theological reflection has wanted to confine truly good action within the sphere of the Church. We cannot say that the great pagans had true virtues, said Augustine. The best we can allow is that they did not depart from virtue very much.1 I cannot share this view. God sustains in being all that is, works in and through all events, and elicits response in all created reality. It is, of course, foundational to Christian faith that God works through history, through the particularity of Israel, of Jesus of Nazareth, of the Church. In no way do I wish to reduce these historical particularities to myth or symbol. But the Christian scriptures are quite clear that God is not confined to Israel and Church, and they invite us, 1 Augustine Contra Julianum 4.3.25. This conclusion follows because without faith it is impossible to please God, (Heb. 11.6). He wrestles with the issue from 3.18 on. This is probably the most intransigent of his Anti Pelagian treatises. therefore, to move from the narrative of the particular to discern God at work in all things. Redemption was finished neither on Calvary, nor at the resurrection. The work of redemption is continued by the Holy Spirit. The Messianic writings, the narratives which speak of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, together with all the texts which they presuppose, provide us with criteria to discern that work.'5 It is on these grounds that Aquinas, when turning his mind to the city, noted that there are two aspects of the work of God in the world, creation and governance, and invited rulers and planners to an analogous practice: One who is about to establish a city or a realm must, in the first place, choose a suitable site; healthy, to ensure the health of the inhabitants; fertile to provide for their sustenance; one which will delight the eye with its loveliness and give natural security against hostile attack... Having chosen the site, the next task which confronts the founder of a city or a kingdom is to plan the area to meet all the requirements of civic life... one must decide where to build towns and where to leave the countryside open, or to construct fortifications: centres of study open places for military training, and markets, all have to be taken into consideration: otherwise neither city nor kingdom would long endure attack.1 2 This activity, the activity of establishing a city and setting up civic life, is not outwith the remit of theology and Church precisely because of God\u2019s activity in creation and providence. If God is active and not absent, then faith in the activity of that God informs our building and planning. Because God is the Creator, says Elaine Scarry, \u2018making\u2019 is set apart and honoured as the most morally authoritative of acts, creating divine resonances, amongst other places, at the doorway of the house and the gateway of the city. In imaging God as Creator the Hebrew bible conceives the whole cosmos as the proper territory for acts of artifice and intelligence.3 These are not autonomous, but represent responses to the Creator Spirit. There were, of course, very good reasons for the emergence of the divide between sacred and secular, specifically the desire to avoid the worst of all forms of government, theocracy.4 Here above all we see how religion can lead us into the valley of the shadow of death. In this as in 1 In his condemnation of liberal theology Graham Ward seems to me to miss this point. There is a difference between reducing incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection to metaphors, and learning from them how it is that God acts and seeking to discern God in the world in the light of them. Cities of God (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 43. 2 Aquinas, \u2018On Princely Government\u2019, ch. 13 in Selected Political Writings, ed. A. D\u2019Entreves (Oxford: Blackwell, 1948). 3 E. Scarry, The Body in Pain (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 222. 4 I read thus Marsiglio of Padua\u2019s Dfensor Pads which, in 1324, already argued for a properly secular realm. He had every reason for being sceptical of the claims of the Church. other areas recognition of the Lordship of Christ over every aspect of life is a quite different matter from the tutelage of the Church over every area, or even the belief that piety is always what promotes true human integrity.1 But this political need cannot blind us to the foundational impossibility of generalising the divide. A Trinitarian theology cannot allow a secular and sacred divide, in which \u2018secular\u2019 occupations are left to the non theologians, and theology confined to specialists. Rather, the rationale of such a theology will be a discernment of God active in God\u2019s world. This includes the built environment. This seems to be straightforward, but as I have noted, the written tradition is largely silent about this and amongst many Christians the secular/sacred prejudice is still strong. When you announce a lecture on the theology of the built environment people expect you to talk about churches, and are disappointed when you do not! This book is not about churches, but about supposedly \u2018secular\u2019 buildings and settlements. To answer the disappointment of those who look for a book on \u2018sacred\u2019 buildings and places I begin by considering the reasons for the silence of theology about the built environment, and ways we might go about such theological reflection. GOD IN THE (EVERYDAY) BUILT ENVIRONMENT Writing about the suburban house, John Archer remarks that eighteenth century European thought had articulated a number of fundamental polarities subject/object, public/private, masculine/feminine but that \u2018such distinctions had no more than putative existence until they could be realized in the material domain of everyday life\u2019.2 One may doubt both that Archer\u2019s polarities are the invention of the eighteenth century, and that they are exclusively European, but he is right that ideologies are only of consequence when they impinge on \u2018the material domain of everyday life\u2019 through legal and political codes, social practices, and the shaping of space. The built environment, which \u2018provides us with all the most direct, frequent and unavoidable images and experiences of everyday life\u2019, is never just happenstance.3 It reflects conscious decisions which in 1 As Blake puts it in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: \u2018Let the Priests of the Raven of dawn, no longer in deadly black, with hoarse note curse the sons of joy. Nor his accepted brethren \u2014 whom, tyrant, he calls free \u2014 lay the bound or build the roof.... For every thing that lives is Holy.\u2019 Complete Writings, ed. G. Keynes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1969), p. 160. 2 J. Archer, \u2018Colonial Suburbs in South Asia 1700\u20141850, and the Spaces of Modernity\u2019, in R.

Williams, Greening the Built Environment ( London: Earthscan, 1998), p. 13. turn reflect ideologies and class positions.1 \u2018Grasped as an image\u2019, says Heinrich Rombach,\u2018the basic character of a farmhouse says a great deal more about the \u201cspirit\u201d of the country, and a style of building reveals more of the basic philosophy of a period, than the carefully smoothed out texts of the school philosophy of that time.\u20192 Not just farmhouses, we have to add, but council estates, tower blocks and out of town shopping centres; and not just philosophy, but theology. Theology, as one form of ideology, plays its part in the shaping of space, and not just in overtly religious buildings, nor just in pre secular societies. I have insisted that a Trinitarian theology eliminates any fundamental distinction between sacred and secular. This seems to be a paradoxical claim the moment we look at the built environment, for humans have everywhere marked out sacred space from the secular. Karsten Harries suggests that the history of building forms an ellipse between the private and the public, domestic and \u2018pedigreed\u2019. The archetypal version of the latter, in his view, is the church or temple (we must add, mosque).3 There is, he insists, a necessary dialectic between these two forms, in that it is the whole point of \u2018architecture\u2019, by which he means the non domestic, to take leave of the everyday and then return to it with fresh eyes.4 I think we cannot escape this ellipse, but it is not unproblematic from the perspective of the Christian tradition. Karl Barth noted that Christianity showed a certain preference for the oppressed, those falling short, for the immature and the sullen.5 I would put it slightly differently and say that we find in Scripture, classically in the Magnificat, a preference for the everyday, the modest, humble and ordinary, and we cannot but take account of that in reflecting on the built environment. This leaves us with an embarrassment, because to be interested in \u2018architecture\u2019 is to be concerned almost solely with what I will call, following Redfield, \u2018the great tradition\u2019.6 Redfield distinguishes between the great tradition, the written and celebrated, the work of the philosophers, historians, theologians, the learned, and the little tradition, which for the most part comes to us only in scraps, in folk memories, songs, tales and ballads, in pamphlets crudely written. One of the remarkable things about the 1 Cf S. Giedion: the main task facing contemporary architecture is \u2018the interpretation of a way of life valid for our period\u2019.

Hoskyns (London: Oxford University Press, 1933), 5 6 2? R. Redfield, Peasant Society and Culture (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1956) ch. 3. New Testament is that it contains so many documents which bear the marks of the little tradition, written in a Greek which was an acute embarrassment to the first educated Christians. In the built environment the great tradition means the work of prestigious architects or planners, whilst the little tradition corresponds to the work of unknown craftsmen who have left their mark on every ancient village, town and city Christianity, I shall claim, is wedded to the little tradition. This would not be contentious were it not for what seems to be the elective affinity between Christianity and the great tradition \u2014 in music, art, literature and, perhaps above all, building. Since one of my aims is to champion precisely the little tradition in the built environment, I will substantiate my claim about the Christian marriage, and by the same token ask about the reason for the deafening silence on the little tradition in architecture in Christian reflection. Theology works between a triangle of text, tradition and experience. \u2018Tradition\u2019, here, almost invariably means the great tradition, from Origen to Barth or John Milbank. In this tradition, it is true, there have been many trends which have militated against a perception of God in our everyday built environment. There has been, in the first instance, a marked emphasis on the spiritual as opposed to the material, on the priority of the civitas Dei to the dvitas terrena. We crave freedom from death, deception and distress, Augustine wrote, and we will never have that in this life. \u2018In our present state what human being can live the life he wishes, when the actual living is not in his control... life will only be truly happy when it is eternal.\u20191 The problem with this Platonising train of reflection is that it rules out true happiness in this life, and in so doing relativises the significance of what we do here. Even in the late twentieth century, with all its hedonism, activism and emphasis on the pleasures of the body, prominent representatives of this view could be found. Thus Edward Norman, in his 1978 Reith Lectures, claimed that the \u2018true Christ of history\u2019 directed people to \u2018turn away from the preoccupations of human society\u2019 and characterised Christianity as the \u2018evocation of the unearthly\u2019.2 No theological understanding of the built environment could emerge from this theology. Such a theology is interested only in church building, and in building which seeks to \u2018evoke the unearthly\u2019 at that. But such a theology shortchanges the world in which we live. As Nicholas Wolterstorff remarks: 1 Augustine, The City of God, Book 14.25. 2 E. Norman, Christianity and the World Order (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979), PP 7 ^\u201c 9 The tragedy of modern urban life is not only that so many in our cities are oppressed and powerless, but also that so many have nothing surrounding them in which any human being could possibly take sensory delight. For this state of affairs we who are Christians are as guilty as any. We have adopted a pietistic materialistic understanding of man, viewing human needs as the need for a saved soul plus the need for food, clothes and shelter. True shalom is vastly richer than that.30 On top of this relativising of the present has been an introspective tradition which began with Augustine\u2019s Confessions and which has concentrated on the inner life at the expense of the active. In medieval theology in particular there was a strong sense that communion with God required retreat, the cloister, cutting oneself off from the everyday. \u2018Unless a man has disentangled himself from all things created,\u2019 wrote Thomas a Kempis in the fifteenth century, \u2018he will not be free to make for the things of God\u2019, and this was a representative view.31 Richard Sennett\u2019s marvellously rich meditation on the urban order, The Conscience of the Eye, begins with precisely this prioritisation of interiority. \u2018Nothing is more cursed in our culture\u2019, he writes, than the continuing separation between inner and outer. It makes the places we live in puzzling to us.\u2018The street is a scene of outside life, and what is to be seen on the street are beggars, tourists, merchants, students, children playing, old people resting a scene of human differences. What is the relation of these differences to inner life?\u2019 The Augustinian tradition, he says, deprives us of the ability to make sense of them.32 A further difficulty is symbolised by the medieval distinction, based on the Latin of i Corinthians 7.25, between precepts, binding on everyone, and counsels, taken up by those who sought to be perfect, which institutionalised a distinction between religious and everyday, sacred and secular.33 Those who took monastic vows, and fulfilled the counsels, were the ones who led a truly Christian life. Politically, the division of powers between Pope and emperor corresponded to this distinction; socially, the division of realms between sacred and secular. The need to find God apart from the structures of everyday life found architectural expression in the theology of sacred space. To say that the eucharist can only be celebrated on \u2018consecrated\u2019 ground could be seen as denying the holiness 3 \u00b0 N. Wolterstorff, Artin Action (Carlisle: Solway, 1997), p. 82. 31 Thomas a Kempis, The Imitation ofChnst (London: Burns &amp; Oates, 1959), Book 1 ch. 20(a); Book in ch. 31. 32 R. Sennett, The Conscience of the Eye (New York: Norton, 1990), pp. 9 10. 33 Paul wrote: \u2018Concerning virgins I have no commandment ( praeceptum) of the Lord, but I give my opinion (&lt; consilium ) as one who by the Lord\u2019s mercy is trustworthy.\u2019 of creation as a whole. To say one\u2019s prayers, to encounter the divine, one therefore went to special buildings, set apart, and within those buildings the chancel and altar area were in turn increasingly fenced off from the mundane world, accessible only to the clergy. In the middle ages, at least, sacred and secular architecture were distinguished in terms of vertical and horizontal axes, the one reaching to heaven, the other \u2018the temporal death shadowed dwelling on earth\u2019.1 I shall return to this distinction in the following chapter. The Reformation represented an attack on many of these distinctions, and the radical Reformation changed the idea of sacred space, so that the house once again became church.2 Sacred space, however, would not be pushed away. In his famous essay, The Sacred and the Profane, Mircea Eliade argued that the distinction between sacred and profane was probably ineliminable, even in the most secularised of worlds. Human beings become aware of the sacred \u2018because it manifests itself, shows itself, as something wholly different from the profane\u2019, though in and through objects that are an integral part of our natural \u2018profane\u2019 world.3 As a description of the sacramental I would regard this as unexceptionable. The sacramental precisely refuses any division of realms. It arises from a Trinitarian perception which sees God in all things, even in sin and death (the cross). Eliade, however, with much of the Christian tradition, goes on to talk of two fundamentally different orders of human experience so that we have sacred and profane space, sacred time and ordinary time, even sacred and profane love, the practical implication of Nygren\u2019s Agape and Eros. The effect of the distinction is, once again, to mark off only one small area of experience as the sphere of encounter with God. This is counter to any kind of Trinitarian perception but, as we know, the doctrine of the Trinity was, for most of the Christian centuries hitherto, virtually a dead letter. In the nineteenth century the \u2018art for art\u2019s sake\u2019 movement represented another version of this separation of realms. There was art, and all the rest was not art. During this period, says Benevolo, \u2018Art took on the task of communicating emotion and organizing the language of the heart... the urban setting was cut off from this process. Art was stripped 1 Harries, Function, p. 187. 2 See, for example. Flora Thompsons account of the Methodist meeting in her hamlet in Lark Rise to Candleford (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1954), ch. 14. 3 M. Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane (New York: Harcourt &amp; Brace, 1959), p. 11 He was drawing on Rudolf Otto\u2019s Die Heilige ( The Idea of The Holy), published in 1917, which traced the root of religion to the \u2018numinous\u2019, which broke in on the believer and left her trembling in awe and fear. This experience was marked off as sharply as possible from the everyday. from the city and became an experience specific to certain spaces, to be enjoyed during leisure time.\u20191 When cities were ruthlessly rebuilt and only \u2018important\u2019 buildings preserved, quite apart from their original context, the separation of art and life and the transfer of beauty to the separate sphere of entertainment and free time was reinforced.2 Harries remarks that religion and \u2018art for art\u2019s sake\u2019 have to be enemies because all religion claims integrative power.3 I have put this differently, in terms of the claims of God upon the whole of our life, and the activity of God in the whole of life, but I agree. A new cause for the division of sacred and secular appeared when existentialism, the philosophy which was to dominate the middle years of the twentieth century, privileged the extraordinary, \u2018boundary situations\u2019, and the experience of angst, over the everyday. When Paul Tillich fled to the United States in 1933 he took his existentialism with him, and was responsible for its dominance in Anglo Saxon theology until the end of the 1960s. For Tillich the refusal of the division of sacred and secular was part of what he referred to as \u2018the Protestant principle\u2019, and on a number of occasions he attempted short reflections on domestic building. His audiences, however, repeatedly brought him back to churches, and, whilst much theological reflection on art may stem from Tillich, no theology of the everyday built environment developed from his theology.4 Although Tillich himself believed any situation or reality might be a vehicle of ultimate concern I suspect that the concern of existentialism with \u2018anxiety\u2019 or \u2018the boundary\u2019 is the reason for this. Before existentialism had reached the zenith of its influence it was already Eric Auerbach, writing in Istanbul during the Second World War, who marked a reaction to these preoccupations. He began by comparing the Hebrew bible with Homer and noted how in the latter the representation of daily life remains in the peaceful realm of the idyllic, whereas in the Old Testament \u2018the sublime, tragic and problematic take shape precisely in the domestic and commonplace... The sublime influence of God here reaches so deeply into the everyday that the two realms of the sublime and the everyday are not only actually unseparated but basically inseparable.\u20195 In the New Testament we do not, as is often suggested, enter a more spiritualised world. On the contrary, as Auerbach puts it, 1 L. Benevolo, The European City (Oxford: Blackwell, 1993), p. 164. 2 Ibid., p. 180. 3 Harries, Function, p. 331. 3 40 For his reflections on domestic architecture see ch. 8 in On Art and Architecture (New York: 4 Crossroad, 1989) and for the way audiences drew him back to \u2018church\u2019 see ch. 17. 5 E. Auerbach, Mimesis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974), p. 22 (my italics). the story of Christ embraces \u2018a ruthless mixture of everyday reality and the highest and most sublime tragedy\u2019.1 This fact, and the common language and style in which all this was recorded, set a problem for the early Church Fathers, who had to defend Christianity against the attacks of the educated, and in so doing discovered that Scripture had \u2018created an entirely new kind of sublimity, in which the everyday and the low were included, not excluded, so that, in style as in content, it directly connected the lowest with the highest\u2019.2 This, I suggest, will give us theological criteria for our understanding of the built environment. The same is true of the generalisation of vocation by Luther at the Reformation, which tacitly ennobles the calling of the ordinary craftsman, as against the exceptional genius, what we shall later call (in chapter 4) the vernacular against the pedigreed. Others who helped to create the conditions for a theology of the everyday built environment include Paul Tillich\u2019s contemporary, Karl Barth. His second commentary on Romans, published in 1922, appropriated Otto\u2019s language of the \u2018ganz anders \u2019 (\u2018Wholly Other\u2019) in order to use it to attack the very view of religion it represented. Religion, for Barth, meant the domestication of grace the defusing of the danger of God in our midst. On the edge of this attack was the sense that \u2018religion\u2019 became a privileged preserve which squeezed God out of ordinary life. This came into sharper focus in the course of resistance to Hitler, when Barth had to oppose the Lutheran \u2018two kingdoms\u2019 teaching. With increasing clarity Barth sought to put Christ at the centre of all human life \u2014 social and political as well as ecclesiastical, and by implication trivial, routine and humdrum as well as in the great events of war and revolution which he began by echoing in his work. The implications of this can be seen in his great ethics of Creation. Barth did not take up the theme of the built environment, but we have to ask, what are the implications of his attack on religion for this theme? What are the implications of the Lordship of Christ over all, as affirmed at Barmen in 1934, for the world we build? Bonhoeffer famously developed Barth\u2019s attack on religion in his prison letters, going on to ask how it was possible to speak in a \u2018secular\u2019 way about \u2018Cod\u2019, in order to understand God as \u2018really the Lord of the world\u2019.44 The questions posed by this letter have rung down the decades since Bonhoeffer\u2019s correspondence was first published. They were taken up especially by the \u2018secular city\u2019 theologians of the 1960s. The concern with 1 Ibid., p.555. 43 Ibid., p. 154. 2 44 D. Bonhoeffer, Letters and Papers from Prison, 3rd edn (London: SCM, 1967), pp. 280 1. secularisation began shortly after the Second World War, and the driving force was undoubtedly the massive fall offin church attendance, but there was also a more positive side to it. Led by Old Testament scholars like Von Rad, theologians pointed out that the roots of secularisation lay not in the Enlightenment but in Scripture. In Genesis, for example, sun, moon and stars are desacralised: they are there for street lighting, and not to be worshipped. The world is not an \u2018enchanted forest\u2019, but a garden to till and keep. The Exodus teaches us that no one rules by divine right and that all sacral politics can be challenged.1 In the New Testament the idea of the holy is redefined, away from that which is set apart to a recognition of the common as itself holy \u2014 the point of Peter\u2019s vision in Acts io.2 In The Secular City Harvey Cox argued that secularity was rooted in the Hebrew approach to history as a series of events beginning with Creation and heading towards a consummation. The impact of Hebrew faith on the Hellenistic world, mediated through the early Christians, was to \u2018temporalise\u2019 the dominant perceptions of reality so that the world became history part of the priority of time over space which was assumed in most disciplines throughout the century. The effect of this was to negate any distinction between sacred and secular, for the secular or \u2018ordinary\u2019 was the true sphere of God\u2019s operation. Speaking about God in a secular fashion, in his view, requires placing ourselves at those points where the restoring, reconciling activity of God is occurring, where the proper relationship between people is appearing. 3 Other theologians pointed out that the very etymology of the word \u2018profane\u2019 demonstrates that it is an unacceptable category for Christians to use. The word derives from the Latin profano, i.e. before or outside the temple. But according to Paul,\u2018We are the temple of the living God\u2019 (1 Cor. 3.16). For Paul the temple is not a building but the community living in the world. There cannot, therefore, be an idea of the profane as the sum total of common life outside the sphere of the holy.4 From a very different standpoint, Teilhard de Chardin insisted that \u2018by virtue of the Creation, and still more, of the Incarnation, nothing here below is profane for those who know how to see it\u2019.49 1 H. Cox, The Secular City (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965), p. 46. 2 So A. Hake, \u2018Theological Reflections on \u201cCommunity\u201d in A. Harvey (ed.), Theobgy in the City (London: SPCK, 1989), p. 57. 3 Cox, Secular City, p. 265. 4 J. G. Davies, Everyday God (London: SCM, 1972), p. 60. 4 49 P. Teilhard de Chardin, Le Milieu Divin (Glasgow: Collins, 1967), p. 66. If Eliade\u2019s two realms mean the de sanctification of the everyday then the implications of secularisation, by contrast, as Richard Niebuhr rightly observed, is the sanctification of all things. What we learn from Scripture is that every day is the day that the Lord has made; every nation is a holy people called by him into existence in its place and time and to his glory; every person is sacred, made in his image and likeness.50 There is no doubt that the theology of the Secular City was wedded to the optimism of the early nineteen sixties, especially in its embrace of that acme of Enlightenment ideas, the notion that humankind had at last \u2018come of age\u2019.51 It was overly rationalistic and its critique of the city far too muted.52 It succumbed to the danger, of which Barth had warned, of a loss of Christian distinctiveness following from (in this case, not so) secret respect for the fashion of the world, and secret respect for its glory. 53 Ten years after Cox\u2019s book appeared the Green Movement and \u2018Celtic Christianity\u2019 were urgently engaged in the re enchantment of nature in face of its ongoing destruction, and sacral politics made a comeback with a vengeance. It was a classic example of Dean Inge\u2019s famous remark that any theology which marries the Zeitgeist quickly becomes a widower. What was right about it, however, was the celebration of a world in which God is continuously at work, not just in the \u2018nature\u2019 of the Romantic poets, but also in the environments human beings produce for themselves. As Seppo Kjellberg has remarked, Cox was correct to understand the city as a man and God made process \u2018resembling the kingdom of God, which is eschatologically forthcoming, but also already present\u2019.54 That the world is fallen does not mean that goodness, gratuity and divine creativity cannot be found in that world, or that God is not active there. What it calls for is discernment. 5 \u00b0 H. R. Niebuhr, Radical Monotheism and Western Culture (London: Faber, 1961), p. 52. 52 So Jonathan Raban, Soft City (Glasgow: Collins, 1974). There is in this theology, he says, an \u2018overweening emphasis on the rationality of the city\u2019, especially in contrast with the countryside, and he insists by contrast that there is a great deal of superstition in the city and its tribalisms. The magic of the city, he says, \u2018is profoundly solipsistic, self bound, and inward. Its very ignorance of plan or creation is its most obvious strength. One could not deduce the existence of God from the Portobello Road; but one might register from it the force of the amoral, the relative, the anarchistic\u2019 (p. 182). 53 K. Barth, Church Dogmatics IV/2 (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1958), p. 668. 54 S. Kjellberg Urban EcoTheology, p. 109. TRINITARIAN DISCERNMENT To speak of God the Holy Spirit as God the Redeemer, a practice learned from Karl Barth, highlights the eschatological dimension of faith in God, its aspect as critical hope, in dialogue with all forms of secular utopia. \u2018Mere optimism about the future of human accomplishment and progress is never adequate for Christian witness,\u2019 writes Ben Sparks. \u2018There is an apocalyptic edge to the church\u2019s presence in the city, which requires us to be both prophets and builders for the well being of all citizens.\u20191 Where Sparks uses \u2018apocalyptic\u2019 I would use \u2018eschatological\u2019, but the sentiment stands.2\u00ae Dreams, visions, and views of justice of course differ substantially, amongst Christians as amongst everyone else. Amongst liberation theologians there is a move away from \u2018a substantive theology\u2019 applied to diverse situations to \u2018a procedural theology where insight arises not from the application of timeless truths but from listening to the context in which God speaks\u2019.3 The problem is that contexts do not themselves speak. What we have to do is to discern God in the context. Any theology which wants to speak of God in the world is subject to a discipline of discernment. \u2018[Tjest the spirits to see whether they are from God\u2019 (i John 4.1). In order to avoid bondage to some idolatry or other we need to measure our practices by revelation. For this reason theology is, as M. M. Thomas put it, \u2018a spiritual source of constructive and discriminating participation\u2019. \u2018Certainly, we should not seek any new revelation of God in any historical event other than the Christ event, but faith in the divine revelation of Jesus Christ can be a key to understanding and discernment of God\u2019s creation, judgement and redemption in secular history.\u20194 Here Thomas moves from the centrality of the Christ event to the Trinitarian economy. Nicholas Lash has argued that it is the task of the doctrine of the Trinity to obviate the danger of eliding God and the world, and therefore falling into idolatry, by insisting on both God\u2019s presence to the world, and God\u2019s difference. The doctrine gives us a grammar by which to speak of God. Thus, in the doctrine of the Spirit \u2018we learn to find God in all life, all freedom, all creativity and vitality... each 1 O. Ben Sparks III, \u2018From Eden to Jerusalem5, Interpretation 54/1 (January 2000), p. 51. 2 Apocalyptic is an increasingly popular genre post Hiroshima and in the shadow of the environmental crisis. Its danger is luxuriating in hopes for an end for this wicked world. Eschatology, we have been taught by Moltmann, prioritises hope. 3 P. Hackwood and P. Shiner, \u2018New Role for the Church in Urban Policy?5, in M. Northcote (ed.), Urban Theology, A Reader (London: Cassell, 1998), p. 74. 4 M. M. Thomas, The Christian Response to the Asian Revolution (London: SCM, 1966), p. 22. unexpected attainment of relationship and community\u2019.1 The doctrine of creation ex nihih, on the other hand, insists on God\u2019s absolute difference from the world, whilst the doctrine of the incarnation points us to the history of interpretative practice which teaches us to use the word God, in the stories which take us from Exodus to Easter. The doctrine of the Trinity, therefore, functions both \u2018to indicate where God is to be found and \u2014 by denying, at each point, that what we find there is to be simply identified with God \u2014 to prevent us from getting stuck in one sidedness... The doctrine thus leads at every turn, to both affirmation and denial.\u20192 It offers us, in other words, rules for discernment in understanding where God is in the everyday world. This is not to say that faith is a matter of \u2018mere\u2019 interpretation because, as Lash argues, the interpretations we offer make a difference to our experience itself, just as being in relation or being in community do, and that is the \u2018point\u2019 of believing.3' Drawing on the theology of Gregory Nazianzus, Sigurd Bergmann offers a liberation theology of the built environment with a Trinitarian shape. The relationships of the Triune God point us to community; the crucified God points us to the simultaneous presence of good and evil; the Spirit works in each place for human freedom.41 shall be taking up these suggestions in various ways in what follows. GRACE AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT I have tried to argue that Christian reflection on the built environment will take the shape of a Trinitarian theological ethic, reflecting on God in all reality, and thus refusing the pre Christian distinction between sacred and secular. This articulates itself as a theology of grace. The word \u2018grace\u2019 as part of Christian vocabulary we owe to Paul. He took over a word in common parlance, charis (translated by the Latin gratia, and so by English \u2018grace\u2019), which meant, amongst other things, charm, beauty, and spiritual energy, and reinvented it in relation to his understanding of what had happened in Christ. Charis means the fact that God works in weakness rather than in power (2 Cor. 12.9) and signifies love in action (Rom. 6.1). Christ inaugurates a new order kata charin (according to grace) rather than 1 N. Lash, Easter in Ordinary: Reflections on Human Experience and the Knowledge of God (London: SGM, 1988), p. 267. 2 Ibid., p.267. 3 Ibid., p. 248. 3 62 S. Bergmann,Gmi, der Natur befieit. Die trintansche Kosmologie Gregors von Nazianz im Horizont drier 4 \u00f6kologischen Theologie der Btfrdimg (Mainz: Gr\u00fcnewald, 1995) kata opheilema (according to what is due) (Rom. 4.4). Because it stands for what God has done freely in Christ, with no conditions or strings attached, it means radical giftedness, calling forth radical gift in return (1 Cor. 12). By the same token, it is about our \u2018absolute dependence\u2019, the fact that \u2018I am a debtor to all/to all I am bounden/Fellowman and beast, season and solstice, darkness and light/And life and death\u2019, as Edwin Muir put it in The Debtor. This great poem articulates what it means to live in response to grace, namely in acknowledgement that I am not my own, that I am bought with a price, that I am a debtor to all. Augustine emphasised the need for grace to live the Christian life, though what he meant by the term was fatally distorted by his controversy with Pelagius, which forced him into extreme positions. Drawing on his discussions, Aquinas defined grace as \u2018a kind of interior disposition infused into us which inclines us to act rightly\u2019, \u2018something supernatural issuing in human persons from God\u2019.\u00ae3 He also thought of the sacraments as instrumental causes of grace, \u2018instruments of divine power\u2019.\u00ae4 Sacraments were, therefore, \u2018channels of grace\u2019. Though these views on grace can be interpreted freely they fail to do justice to the radical quality of Paul\u2019s vision. First, in concentrating on the believing individual they underplay the sense in which creation is grace. The fact that creation is grace, acknowledged every time we say \u2018grace\u2019 at meals, is what illuminates the divine giftedness of everyday. The word \u2018grace\u2019 is not a reference to a \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018influence\u2019 breaking through at certain key moments but a way of saying that the God who loves in freedom sustains the fabric of daily life, including our own. \u2018Sacraments\u2019 signify precisely this.\u00ae5 What the eucharist signifies is not the existence of a sacred world set over against the profane, requiring its own sacral space and time, but rather the hallowing of the ordinary \u2014 of bread, wine, labour and community. Because creation is grace, grace is concrete: it meets us in what Padraic Pearse called \u2018the bulks of ordinary things\u2019 and this of course includes buildings and settlements, the places in which we live and work. The theology of everyday life, therefore, is a theology of grace as a theology of gratuity, of love \u2018for nothing\u2019, and of joy in the minutiae of things. Recognition that we \u2018live by grace\u2019 puts an end to all notions of \u2018building the kingdom\u2019. The insistence that we do not and cannot do this has been an obligatory caveat in all liberation theology from the beginning, and for good reason. \u2018Dear N.N.,\u2019 Karl Barth wrote to an enthusiastic theological student who used this language in 1967, \u2018in speaking thus you do not contradict merely one \u201cinsight\u201d but the whole message of the whole Bible. If you persist in this idea I can only advise you to take up any other career than that of pastor.\u20191 This seems to call in question Blake\u2019s famous verse: I will not cease from Mental Fight, Nor shall the Sword sleep in my hand Till we have built Jerusalem In England\u2019s green &amp; pleasant Land.2 What is often not remarked is that Blake suffixes this poem with Numbers 11.29: \u2018Would to God that all the Lord\u2019s people were Prophets\u2019, a reference to the descent of the Spirit on elders who had not initially been \u2018ordained\u2019. The poem is thus not Pelagian in intent at all, but an expression of confidence in God\u2019s Spirit to re make human beings and therefore their world. I have taken this text as the superscription for the whole book precisely for this reason, and because it classically calls into question that reliance on either the state or technocratic expertise which has so disabled people in relation to the built environment. Building Jerusalem, the city of justice, peace and beauty, is a project which will never be completed this side of the kingdom, but it is a project to which we are called by the kingdom, by \u2018grace abounding in the lives of sinners\u2019. This was emphatically denied by the Calvinist sociologist and theologian Jacques Ellul, who attacked \u2018the Thomist heresy\u2019 that \u2018grace does not destroy nature but perfects it\u2019. According to him the city is an attempt to prolong the momentary gift of Christ\u2019s healing during his life on earth. \u2018This is the tragedy of ideal cities, the terrible problem of modern urbanism, as of older utopianism; not believing that this meeting with Christ is unique, that it cannot be prolonged on earth, that it is only a sign of the hidden kingdom and an announcement of the kingdom to come.\u20193 Cities represent the hubristic attempt to build an ideal place for full human development, equilibrium and virtue, the attempt to construct what God wants to construct, and to put humankind in the centre, in God\u2019s place. 1 K. Barth, Letters ig 6 i ig 68 (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1981), p. 283. 2 W. Blake, Milton, Complete Writings, ed. G. Keynes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1969), p. 480. 3 J Ellul, The Meaning of the City (Grand Rapids, Eerdmans, 1970), p. 130. However, whilst rejecting the Thomist doctrine of grace Ellul replaces it by a doctrine of pardon and acceptance which concretely amounts to the very same thing. We learn from the myth of the heavenly city, he says, that the golden age will be characterised by an acceptance of history, and not by its refusal.1 Furthermore, because Christ is Saviour and Lord of both creation and humankind, he is also Saviour and Lord of human works. To the extent that in Christ, therefore, the city is not devilish, to the extent that it is destined to be transfigured, we must work along with others in the construction of the city.2\u00b0 The city pardoned, or gracious building a sign of the liberative activity of God at work in the depths of creation? Whichever way we have it, what is essential is to recognise that, as Bonhoeffer put it, God is indeed and in truth Lord of the world, and therefore does not leave Godself without effect. \u2018Grace\u2019 is the word we use to talk about the way in which the liberating God works in the depth of the world. Because God\u2019s Word does not return to God void (Isa. 55.11) God\u2019s gracious activity has effects (what Aquinas called \u2018created grace\u2019) what we can call \u2018gracious living\u2019. This gracious living is, of course, the very opposite of what is usually designated by this phrase. It is, however, a fundamental reality in daily life, and not least in the built environment. Conversely, and equally importantly, the rejection of grace can also be seen writ large, and in concrete and glass, across our landscapes, the reality of sin. Sin calls for repentance, which in this context means learning new ways of building and planning which follow justice and do not have a hubristic approach to creation. Because the older tradition of grace concentrates on the believer and the sacraments it misses the political sense of the doctrine, a sense on the whole not much remarked by the liberation theology of the late twentieth century.71 The doctrine of grace, of the gratuitousness of all things, is, however, the most politically far reaching of all Christian doctrines. If creation is grace, if I am \u2018a debtor to all\u2019, then self evidently life is not there to appropriate the benefits for myself, to hoard things over against others. The only response to grace, as Barth always insisted, is gratitude, which politically means the struggle for social justice. It is precisely because he was a \u2018theologian of grace\u2019 that Barth was a political theologian. Grace, as a political doctrine, keeps the importance of the attempt to realise human equality on the agenda against the cynicism of\u2018realists\u2019 of all kinds, including theological realists. Because, as E. M. Wood puts it, \u2018a humane,\u201csocial\u201d, truly democratic and equitable capitalism is more 1 Ibid., p. 162. 2 Ibid., p. 180. 2 71 An exception is the work of L. Boff, Liberating Grace (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1979). unrealistically utopian than socialism\u2019 it will also involve a continuing commitment to alternative politics.1 To recognise grace as a political principle is important first because, as Luther used to say, grace is forgiveness. So if our demand for social justice issues from our experience of grace, then it is equally incompatible with hatred of the oppressor. I am a debtor to all even my enemy. But grace has always retained in common parlance the sense of charm and beauty, and so to recognise grace as our political principle is at the same time to recognise the importance of the experiences of love, friendship, art and beauty to the political process. This is of the first importance when we recognise the built environment as part of that process. LIBERATION THEOLOGY AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT As a theology of human equality, of social justice, of forgiveness and of beauty the theology of grace is also a theology of liberation. Defining it thus needs care. Once the initial excitement of liberation theology had worn off by the end of the 1970s the problem with it was that it became just one option amongst others. Some have suggested that its usefulness is already passed, that it has nothing to say to the Network Society, and the world of Cyberspace.2 By a theology of liberation, however, I mean a theology committed to its context, to the local as the key to the global, to the concrete, and to the necessity of praxis. It is also a theology which understands \u2018sin\u2019 in a structural way, as being spiritual precisely in economic, social and political dimensions. Because it does this it always follows Barth\u2019s advice and reads with the Bible in one hand and the newspaper or various forms of social analysis \u2014 in the other. It is this method I follow in the present book, listening to what the geographers, planners and architects have to say in order to bring this material to theological reflection. Neither sin nor redemption can be understood either individualistically or abstractly. Here I want to try and understand them in relation to the built environment. Characterising liberation theology thus I would borrow a distinction from Anselm and say that there are two kinds of theology: that which names the God of cross and resurrection, the God who is radical gift in 1 E. M. Woods, Democracy against capitalism: Renewing historical materialism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 293. 2 So Graham Ward in Cities of God&gt; pp. 28, 51. On my definition what he sets out is a form of liberation theology. The problem is, however, that the focus is exclusively on community, and does not take into account the environmental dimension which is crucial to any contemporary reflection. Godself, the theology of liberation, on the one hand, and the theology of bats and owls disputing about the midday sun on the other. Christian theology is concerned, in Paul Lehmann\u2019s phrase, with what it takes to make and to keep human life human. It is concerned with what God does (if anything) to free us from all those things which de humanise us, which Scripture and tradition name variously as sin or the \u2018principalities and powers\u2019. Because we are earth and not angels these things are essentially bound up with the physical and historical material, with bodies and buildings and structures and institutions. The process of liberation goes on there and not just in our minds and souls. And the claim of the gospel is that, appearances to the contrary, this process of liberation does go on here and now it is not something we simply have to sigh for in the next life. In understanding redemption as liberation in relation to the built environment I take Walter Wink\u2019s work on the Powers as a fundamental clue.1 The New Testament language of\u2018the Powers\u2019, he argues, refers to \u2018the actual spirituality at the center of... political, economic, and cultural institutions\u2019: The spiritual aspect of the Powers is not simply a \u2018personification\u2019 of institutional qualities that would exist whether they were personified or not. On the contrary, the spirituality of an institution exists as a real aspect of the institution even when it is not perceived as such. Institutions have an actual spiritual ethos, and we neglect this aspect of institutional life to our peril.2 3 Places, as well as churches and nations, have what is sometimes an almost tangible inner spirituality, which marks them off from every other place, and puts its impress on its citizens. Architecture can be an especially eloquent expression of this inner spirituality. Wink gives the example of being in a church in Peru which was \u2018dead\u2019. \u2018What could the priest say that could counteract the thunderous statement made by a building erected on the site of a razed Inca temple, by virtual slave labour, adorned with gold leaf stolen from a high civilization by a group of Spanish thugs, and whose chapel had been converted into a curio shop?\u20197\u00ae Mutatis mutandis this question is raised in virtually every human settlement, from the 1 \u2018W. Wink, Naming the Powers, Unmasking the Powers, Engaging the Powers, all Minneapolis: Fortress, 1984, 1986, 1992 respectively. 2 Wink, Engaging the Powers, p. 6. Harries cites a dispute between Ernst Gombrich and Hans Sedlmayr as to whether style teaches us that spiritual collectives are independent realities. Gombrich thought such talk weakened resistance to totalitarian habits of thought (Harries, Function, p. 64). Wink demonstrates precisely the contrary. 3 Wink, Unmasking the Powers^ p. 74. smallest village to the greatest city, and in relation to all of our buildings. Stephen Sykes has warned that the use of the term \u2018spirituality\u2019 requires care, but in Wink\u2019s sense it provides us with a crucial theological tool for understanding the built environment, and equally spells out the Church\u2019s task in seeking a world made conform to Christ, a specifically Christian reading of \u2018Vitruvian man\u2019.1 At the turn of the new millennium the material for Christian rumination is particularly densely related and intractable. We have to come to terms with a world population which has doubled in fifty years to top 6 billion, and which has to be not just fed, but housed. We have to come to terms with a change in the balance of human settlements which has profound psychic and spiritual consequences for us. Deep into the twentieth century villages have been home to most of the human race, but in the last decade of that century the proportion of people in cities finally exceeded fifty per cent, and the trend towards urbanisation continues, despite what is called \u2018counter urbanisation\u2019 in some parts of the First World. I shall argue that a liberation theology of the environment seeks to call the world \u2018home\u2019, but these changes call the homeliness of the world in question. The impact of these changes is intensified by the pattern of transport use which became general by the end of the twentieth century. The twentieth century refined and generalised, but did not make substantial advances on, the modes of transport invented at the end of the nineteenth century. These modes of transport, available to a greater and greater share of the world\u2019s population, have put tremendous pressure on both resources and environment, and led to the construction of vast highways and, to use Jane Jacob\u2019s phrase, the sacking of cities. Many environmentalists claim, I shall argue, rightly, that either new inventions and new technologies, or the taming of the aeroplane and the motor car are necessary both to urban and planetary survival. By the end of the twentieth century the environment had become a vital dimension of any liberation theology. The changes brought about both by urbanisation and by new technologies also pose profound problems for human consciousness. To be human, we said, is to be placed. But, as Manuel Castells has argued, the sense of place, of historical, regional and cultural 1 S. Sykes, \u2018Spirituality and Mental Sickness\u2019, in M. Nation and S. Wells (eds.), Faithfulness and Fortitude (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 2000). He writes: \u2018To define \u201cspirituality\u201d as \u201cthe human propensity to find meaning in life\u201d is not merely to retreat from the concrete specificity of Christian spirituality. It is a transformation from a God centred account to one focused on humanity, which, if offered as a substitute for a Christian understanding, would be simply in massive contradiction to the main strands of the Christian tradition (pp. 71\u20142). This does not apply to Wink\u2019s understanding. memory, is increasingly dissolved in what he calls the \u2018space of flows\u2019 the dominance of the world by finance capital, and by great corporations operating through information technology, whose true home often seems to be \u2018cyberspace\u2019. But in this situation the alienation which Marx was analysing in the 1840s, in the context of the first industrial revolution, is greatly intensified, and human beings lose the sense of being at home in the world. Another dimension of this alienation is the loss of charm in all forms of the built environment. The built environment reflects not just ideologies but, in Wink\u2019s terms, spiritualities. Profound, creative, grace filled spiritualities produce grace filled environments; banal, impoverished, alienated spiritualities produce alienating environments. If that is the case, and I believe it is undeniable, then theology is anything but incidental to the debate about the built environment which is such a vital dimension of the human future. Christians in the city \u2018have the opportunity to lead and advocate for neglected understandings of the city and of civil government\u2019, but in order to do this they need serious biblical and theological reflection.1 Where Ben Sparks speaks of\u2018the city\u2019 here I have placed the built environment as a whole. Nearly half of humankind live in villages and suburbs, and exactly the same goes for them. What I am attempting is not an essay in urban theology, or theology of the city, although some chapters deal primarily with the city, but a theological reflection on the living environment we make for ourselves. I begin with an exploration of the most basic dimension of thinking about the built environment, the divine grounding of our experience of space, and I set out a Trinitarian mapping of that space. In the third chapter I go on to a major theme of the Hebrew bible, explored at length in the Christian tradition, and of fundamental significance in an unjust world, the ownership of land. The human dwelling is the theme of the next chapter, an area where renewal of imagination is of key importance as, in the West, we seem to have built ourselves into a dead end. I then attempt a theological reflection on the ancient theme of town and country, before turning to the meaning of the city. In chapters 7 and 8 I examine the built environment as shaper of community and as work of art before, in the final two chapters, asking what is required of us as builders, planners and place dwellers in the opening decades of the new millennium, foregrounding here the question of eschatology, what we can hope for. The Trinitarian appropriations, the attempt to understand the world as it is as created, and in the process of redemption 1 Sparks, \u2018From Eden to Jerusalem\u2019, p. 49. and reconciliation, are fundamental to each chapter. I assume, in my treatment of supposedly secular, non theological material, that God the Creator calls all things into being, that God the Reconciler works even now for justice and peace, both through the Church and outwith it, and that God the Redeemer offers us grounds of hope where otherwise that seems more than fragile. In all this I am not attempting to show that, in this or that particular instance, religion, whether Christian or otherwise, lay behind this or that settlement or building. Sometimes this is obvious, at other times it is not. Rather, I take it for granted that theology\u2019s major part in the ideologies of all human cultures, not excluding the present, always functions to shape our world. \u2018The faith and trust of the heart make both God and idol,\u2019 said Luther. The question is not really about interesting aspects of cultural history. It is much more about what we are doing with our present. Christians are, as Stanley Hauerwas puts it, following Augustine, \u2018resident aliens ', which is to say, called to live counter culturally (Mark 10.43) but to do so as residents, as those totally committed to their locality and to the earth (Jer. 29.5). As such they need both to be informed about their world and to reflect on it in the light of their tradition of unsettlement. It is the task of theology to help them to do that, and this book is one small part of that process. Theology is always primarily addressed to the Church, but it is addressed to the Church at a particular time, seeking to understand itself and what, in faith, it has to contribute to the world of which it is an indissoluble part. What happens when we bring together the Bible and the writings of town planners, urban theorists and architects? This book is one tentative attempt to find out. Constructed space and the presence of God ... you have made the Lord your refuge, the Most High your dwelling place... (Psalm 91.9) After my insistence on beginning with the concrete, I now take a slight step backwards to discuss the conditions of possibility for the built environment, space in general. Does God have space in Godself? If God is a spatial can our spaces \u2014 which are always both literally and metaphorically constructed be redeemed? In asking about the grounding of space in God, we are asking about the possibility of ultimate redemption for what we have made of the world. In exploring the issue I shall seek to bring into conversation Christian and non Christian ideologies, or theology and secular theory. Picking up the theme of the first chapter I shall end with an attempt at a Trinitarian mapping of space. THE IDEOLOGY OF SPACE In the broadest sense the built environment is a political question \u2014 it concerns the constitution of the polis, the shape of the human community. \u2018Shape\u2019 here is not a metaphor. At levels of complexity greater than hunter gatherer societies, all human communities are class, caste, gender, and sometimes racially divided. We need only think of the contrast between palace and slum, caste village and outcaste cheri, the white suburbs of Johannesburg and the townships, the gender division implicit in most Western housing.1 Christian theology has quite often taken issue with these distinctions, in the attack on caste, or on apartheid, for example, but the question of space has only been addressed in the most general terms. This is doubtless partly because, as argued in the previous chapter, 1 For example, writing of India P. Sainath notes: \u2018The cultural geography of the Indian village is carefully laid out to assign to Dalit dwellings the lowliest and least desirable areas\u2019; quoted by V Devi, \u2018A Cry for Justice\u2019, Frontline 17/13 (24 June\u20147 July 2000) p. 50. theology has often been drawn to abstraction, nourished by a Platonic conviction of the superiority of the spiritual to the material. More recently it shared with other disciplines a conviction of the priority of time over space, cast theologically in the ideas of the \u2018great acts of God\u2019 and \u2018Hebrew dynamism\u2019. All this has meant that theology has overlooked the fact that politics is about possession. This is extraordinary given founding narratives about conquest and promised land, and I shall be exploring the issues that arise from this in the following chapter. The demonstration that all space is constructed was a central concern of Henri Lefebvre, who argued that all societies \u2018produce\u2019 their own versions of space. The arrangement of cities, the forms of the built environment, the relation of town and country, he showed, in an argument now fundamental to most geographical and sociological theory, all express a particular vision of the world, an ideology. The ideology of space is inescapable: we encounter it the moment we emerge from our front door, drive to the out of town shopping centre or visit the local post office. In the built environment social relations are inscribed concretely in space. All ideologies \u2018project themselves into a space, becoming inscribed there, and in the process producing that space itself\u2019.1 It is sometimes enough to enter the space of a factory, a state, or a community, comments David Harvey, to conform to its supposed requirements in ways that are both predictable and unthinking. \u2018Thus does the symbolic order of a city\u2019s spaces impose upon us ways of thinking and doing which reinforce existing patterns of social life.\u20192 Not just the city either, for the physical plan of Indian villages was designed to reinforce deference and submission, as was the relation of great house and labourer\u2019s cottage in Europe. The relation between space and ideology is dialectical: ideology is dependent on space, but our use of space both expresses and affects our ideology. An ideology requires \u2018a space which it describes, whose vocabulary and links it makes use of, and whose code it embodies\u2019. Indeed, Lefebvre suggests that \u2018what we call ideology only achieves consistency by intervening in social space and in its production, and thus taking on body therein. Ideology per se might well be said to consist primarily in a discourse on social space.\u20193 To instantiate this claim he turns, perhaps oddly, to the Church. \u2018What would remain of the church if there were no churches? The Christian ideology... has created the spaces which guarantee that it endures.\u20195 1 H. Lefebvre, The Production of Space (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991), p. 129. 2 D. Harvey, The Urban Experience (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989), p. 250. 3 Lefebvre, Production, p. 44. 5 Ibid. He makes the same point about capitalism. Lefebvre has an obvious point, though rather than \u2018ideology\u2019 in the singular, we have to insist on the plurality of Christian ideologies.1 By and large Lefebvre is right that \u2018monumental buildings mask the will to power and the arbitrariness of power beneath signs and surfaces which claim to express collective will and collective thought\u2019.2 It is very doubtful, though, that, as he claims, \u2018[t]he use of the cathedral\u2019s monumental space necessarily entails its supplying answers to all the questions that assail anyone who crosses the threshold\u2019. On the contrary, though these buildings make claims, they can also be understood primarily as celebration, a sort of carnival in stone, or as an invitation to faith, rather than as an attempt to compel assent. This certainly seems to have been Huizinga\u2019s view. \u2018Of no great truth was the medieval mind more conscious\u2019, he wrote, \u2018than of St Paul\u2019s phrase: Videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate, tunc autem facies ad faciem.\u2019 The Middle Ages never forgot that all things would be absurd, if their meaning were exhausted in their function and their place in the phenomenal world, if by their essence they did not reach into a world beyond this... About the figures of the Divinity a majestic system of correlated figures crystallizes, which all have reference to Him, because all things derive their meaning from Him. The world unfolds itself like a vast whole of symbols, like a cathedral of ideas. It is the most richly rhythmical conception of the world, a polyphonous expression of eternal harmony.3 Of course figures like Constantine or William of Normandy, or even the wealthy merchants who paid for the Suffolk wool churches, built churches with a very obvious ideological intent. But in the case of many anonymous religious buildings (whether mosques, temples or churches), which were not part of the self justification or self glorification of rulers or the rich, it is open to argument that they preserve almost uniquely a genuinely democratic space, as the product of a deeply felt piety shared by the workers who put them up, and often enough paid for by the alms of the poor. I shall return to the significance of religious buildings in chapter 8. 1 We only have to think of the different theologies implicit in Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (Istanbul), in early Norman, Romanesque and Perpendicular cathedrals, in Wren\u2019s churches, and in Baptist chapels to see that. The exclusive mystery invoked by Cyril of Jerusalem, the power of Byzantine emperors and Angevin kings, the romance of the Virgin Queen, the deism of mercantile capitalism, the work ethic of seventeenth and eighteenth century Protestantism all these have found expression in church buildings. So survival through time is one thing, but meaning is another. 2 Lefebvre, Proclwotwn, p. 143. 3 J. Huizinga, The Waning of the Middle Ages (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965), p. 203. To instantiate the ideological power of buildings by pointing to the Church is of course highly ironic given the proud boast of the second century apologists that they had no shrines or altars. The missionary bishop Lesslie Newbigin used to advise villagers in South India not to put up buildings but to meet in private houses, and in the 1970s regarded it as the great strength of the church in Nepal that it had no special buildings, but met in clearings and under trees. He was disappointed that in his first diocese, Madurai in South India, every village congregation sooner or later wanted to put up a \u2018church\u2019. To him this detracted from the truth that it was the congregation which was the church. But is the dream of doing without buildings impossibly idealist the product of a theology too purely committed to the Word to the exclusion of structures? And does it imply some failure to take account of the implications of the incarnation for embodiment? Newbigin would have agreed with Barth that the misuse of the category of the incarnation \u2018cried to high heaven\u2019. But is it sound theology to restrict talk of the incarnation solely to the Christ event, and does it not in fact have profound implications for our social and political practice, as Christian socialists have always claimed? All ideologies rest on a view of the human, and if the built environment is a concrete form of ideology we naturally look to its implicit meanings. We have already seen some of these instantiated in the different theologies which lie behind the various forms of church architecture. In a version of Foucault\u2019s now celebrated \u2018heterotopias\u2019 Lefebvre instances spaces dedicated to voluptuousness (the Alhambra of Granada), to contemplation and wisdom (cloisters), to power (castles and chateaux) or to heightened perception (Japanese gardens).1 He could have gone on to domesticity (kitchens, Delft courtyards), production of very various kinds (mills, factories, mines), terror (prisons, torture cells, Gulags), debate (agora, parliamentary buildings), buying and selling (market places, malls), the dead (the Taj Mahal!) and the oldest and most obvious of all dedicated spaces, the sacred. All of these have significance for the liberative theology I wish to develop, and some of them I shall return to in due course. Power and the sacred are, however, fundamental to the whole project, and I shall therefore pursue them a little further here. Power is one of the most obvious meanings of space, and not just in castles and chateaux. As Foucault put it: \u2018A whole history remains to 1 Lefebvre, Production, p. 137. be written of spaces which would at the same time be the history of powers... from the great strategies of geopolitics to the little tactics of the habitat.\u20191 The built environment as a whole is the orthography of power and class. This was true when William of Normandy ordered a detailed record taken of his whole newly conquered realm, detailing every mill and homestead centres of production and domestic space and placing fortresses at strategic points throughout the kingdom. Then, in the greatest of his building programmes, he covered the land with churches, abbeys and cathedrals, claims in stone to ideological legitimacy. This strategy did not end with the Norman builders. \u2018Today more than ever\u2019, wrote Lefebvre in 1974, \u2018the class struggle is inscribed in space.\u2019 Whether that \u2018more than ever\u2019 was really justified is a question. Perhaps \u2018still\u2019 would be a better way of putting it. As an instance we could follow Sudipta Kaviraj\u2019s brilliant exploration of the changing dynamics of space as power in Calcutta.2 First there was the colonial city, where whole areas were proscribed to Indians, and which centred around a beautiful central park, the Maidan, designed to remind the rulers of the great London parks. Like them the Maidan was \u2018public\u2019, which meant an expression of civic pride rather than something created for the exclusive pleasure of a ruler or some member of the nobility. After Independence the Indian administration continued to lay out parks, which beautified the city and emphasised the contrast between nature and culture. Cricket was played in them, a slow and rather expensive game, suited to the middle class. The parks were ringed with railings, as the colonial parks had been, to mark the boundary between the workaday world and recreation. At some point, however, someone erected a makeshift shop against the railings of one of these parks. Soon, the entire park was ringed by shops, and the railings became invisible. In the earlier regime, the parks were there for middle class constitutionals and family picnics. Of course, they were there for everyone, they were \u2018public\u2019, but the poor only came into them apologetically, aware that they were there on sufferance. Now, however, the poor took over the park. Football took over from cricket and the centre of the park became a mass of dry mud. The grass died out, filth accumulated, the poor moved in more or less permanently, and the parks became a form of urban slum. \u2018Ironically, the English term public would be used in the discourse of this crucial d\u00e9tournement of space. If asked, 1 M. Foucault, Power/Knowledge (London: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1980), p. 149. 2 S. Kaviraj, \u2018Filth and the Public Sphere: Concepts and Practices about Space in Calcutta5, Public Culture 10/1 (1997), pp. 83 113. the people would reply that they settled there precisely because this space was pablik, not owned by individual property owners, and as poor people they had a quasi claim to settle in such state or municipal property.\u20191 The poor now in the park were far more tolerant of garbage than the middle class. Its accumulation was their way of keeping the former occupants out. Kaviraj\u2019s \u2018d\u00e9tournement\u2019 might seem a version of the Magnificat. The poor end up as possessors, and the rich are sent empty away. But in some respects this is a hollow victory. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but it is by no means the equivalent of liberation, as D. H. Lawrence indicated in castigating the ugliness of nineteenth century industrial housing, and insisting that the human soul needed beauty more than it needed bread.2 3 4 The story forms an interesting contrast with that of the success of another group of poor people, this time from Liverpool, in Britain. British municipal housing (\u2018council housing\u2019 or \u2018corporation housing\u2019) was a response to the many damning reports on slum housing produced in the nineteenth century, and in particular an attempt to provide \u2018homes fit for heroes\u2019 after World War I. As it actually materialised, however, it was often far from that. First, municipal budgets meant that this housing was sometimes put up as cheaply as possible, on the meanest lines.'4 Second, in an effort to see that houses did not deteriorate residents were forbidden from doing their own decoration, but \u2018the council\u2019 saw that it was done every three or four years. The net result was a potent affirmation of the class divide, between owner occupiers and those who were \u2018a burden on the rates\u2019. Thus, when the citizens of Liverpool were involved in designing new housing in the 1980s they were adamant that the new housing should not look \u2018corpy\u2019. Peter Hall quotes the bricklayer chair of one housing corporation involved in the 1980s re build: \u2018Council housing is the worst housing ever... It\u2019s boring, pathetic, inhuman like someone went into the architect\u2019s department and said, \u201cI want 400 houses get the drawings in by half three\u201d. They\u2019re not houses for peopled 15 Liberative d\u00e9tournement, this story makes clear, 1 Ibid., p. 108. 2 Cited in M. Drabble, A Writer's Britain: Landscape in Literature (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1979), p. 224. 3 So Jeremy Seabrook wrote: \u2018The estates have been constructed with the greatest parsimony of compassion and amenity. They are sketchy, spare and denuded... They invite violence and negation: and the best to be hoped for from the people who are compelled to live here is a sullen and passive indifference\u2019 (City Close Up (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971), p. 14). This echoes my own experience of growing up in council housing in the previous two decades. 4 P. Hall, Cities of Tomorrow (Oxford: Blackwell, 1988), p. 271. requires both empowerment and something more, the possibility of beauty, precisely what was lost in Calcutta. I shall return to this question in the eighth chapter. Today feminist geographers make the point that the power implicit in the arrangement of space is also gendered. Patriarchy has a crucial spatial dimension, a point which is obvious as soon as it is made, but which most of the time, like all good ideologies, is invisible. In the haut bourgeois house women were often allowed into the library only with male permission: the drawing room was their preserve, an arrangement which emphasised that rationality and real power lay with the men. In working class houses until very recently kitchens, where women were expected to spend much of their time, were often cramped and ill lit.1 In the workplace, studies of North American offices have shown that women work significantly more in shared open space than men.2 Dolores Hayden argues that the separation of dwelling and workplace has militated against women\u2019s empowerment, and functioned to keep them in the domestic world.3 A liberative theology, which will automatically be a feminist theology, shares with these geographers a concern for re thinking gendered space. A crucial aspect of power which finds expression in the built environment is propaganda, something which rulers have known from Hellenistic, if not Egyptian and Mesopotamian, times. \u2018Political space is not established solely by actions,\u2019 says Lefebvre. \u2018The genesis of space of this kind also presupposes a practice, images, symbols and the construction of buildings, of towns and of localized social relationships.\u20194 The twentieth century was rich in the perception of this truth: consider the different forms of Fascist and Stalinist monumentality, and the authoritarian visions of Le Corbusier, measured against the utopian socialism of Unwin\u2019s Letchworth, which was inspired by a romantic vision of the middle ages.5 In Wink\u2019s terms the Powers express themselves in many forms in the built environment. Wink speaks of the Powers being created, fallen and redeemed. We know what \u2018fallen\u2019 buildings look like. Do we know what they look like redeemed? The very question makes the point 1 It was, however, a point of principle with Raymond Unwin to see that the kitchen should get some sunshine during the day. 2 D. Spain, Gendered Spaces (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992), p. 206. 3 D. Hayden, \u2018What would a non sexist city be like?\u2019, Signs 5/3 (Supplement) (1980), pp. 170 87. 4 Lefebvre, Production, p. 245. 5 As Graham Ward correctly notes, the attempt to recall the middle ages in built form took no account of the fact that this form expressed a world view which was now irrecoverable. Cities of God (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 39. that humane and non imperialist cultures are essential before we learn to build like this. Over against spaces dedicated to power Lefebvre set spaces for pleasure and voluptuousness but believed that while such spaces have existed, they are few and far between. \u2018An architecture of pleasure and joy, of community in the use of the gifts of the earth, has yet to be invented.\u201921 The reader of Scripture will at once think of the \u2018city\u2019 of the Song of Songs, but perhaps that is any environment seen in the light of romantic love. Lefebvre thought that in and through the space of leisure a pedagogy of space and time was beginning to take shape. That was in 1974. Was he thinking of the tourist beaches already well established by that time? Of the erosion of every popular mountain trail and indeed every climbing route? What would he have made, I wonder, of Disneyland Paris and the ever larger out of town shopping centres? The pedagogy of places dedicated to leisure seems only too imbricated in the pedagogy of power. Lefebvre distinguished spatial practice the particular use of space of a given culture; representations of space, which the relations of production impose; and representational spaces. In medieval Europe, for example, spatial practice embraced the network of local roads close to peasant communities, monasteries and castles, and also the many roads between towns and the great pilgrim and crusader ways. Representations of space, on the other hand, were borrowed from Aristotelian and Ptolemaic conceptions, as modified by Christianity: the so called \u2018three tier universe\u2019 of heaven and hell, with the earth at the centre. Representational spaces, for their part, \u2018determined the foci of a vicinity: the village church, graveyard, hall and fields, or the square and the belfry. Such spaces were interpretations, sometimes marvellously successful ones, of cosmological representations.\u201922 If we map this scheme onto the present then surely we end up with a situation where representations of space are concerned above all with leisure and consumption, and where such pedagogy of space and time as there is, is wedded to the market. For those in the West representational spaces include spaces dedicated to consumption (shopping malls), to keeping the need for reflection at bay (amusement arcades), and to the fetishisation of the body (sex shops, body piercing studios). Equally in our own day the lyrical spaces of mountains, lakes and forests, celebrated the moment industrial capitalism began to emerge, have been first defended 21 Lefebvre, Production, p. 379. 22 Ibid., p. 45. and then problematised as reserves and national parks. For they too are reinscribed with the fundamental meaning of leisure, and the problem of over use becomes ever more serious. The representation of space in our society is in turn something like an account of\u2018real estate\u2019. The development of map making, David Flarvey argues, meant that space came to be represented, like time and value, as abstract, objective, homogeneous and universal in its values. Space was bought and sold as a commodity and the effect was to bring all space under the single measuring rod of money value.1 Once money becomes a mediator of commodity exchange this radically transforms and fixes the meanings of space and time in social life. It is not only time but space which \u2018is\u2019 money, a process compounded by the growth of casino capitalism where property is bought and sold as an investment in the same way as stocks and shares. The contrast between these two spatial mappings, the medieval and the modern, speaks volumes, for what has disappeared is the transcendent reference, and what has taken its place is Mammon. In chapter 9 I will take up the environmental implications of this fact. The social implications are examined by Castells in terms of a contrast between the \u2018space of places\u2019 and the \u2018space of flows\u2019.2 By the latter he means the social reality of the world in the information society, where money is made and information accessed in seconds by the world wide informational network. Just as the pack horse defined space in medieval times, and the railway for the industrial revolution, so information technology does now. In the network, \u2018no place exists by itself, since the positions are defined by flows\u2019. The key points in this space of flows are the \u2018nodes\u2019 and \u2018hubs\u2019 which are the key movers in the global economy, and in high technology manufacturing. Information is managed by a global elite who constitute \u2018symbolically secluded communities, retrenched behind the very material barrier of real estate pricing\u2019, a sort of super class.3 World wide they create a uniform lifestyle which supersedes historical specificity, a uniformity reflected in the architecture of postmodernity. Everyone, of course, still lives in a territorially defined place, but because power lies with the space of flows the meaning and dynamic of places is altered. He sees a schizophrenic tension arising between flows and place: 1 Harvey, Urban Experience^. 177. 2 M. Castells, The Rise of the Network Society (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), pp. 41 off. 3 The dominant tendency is toward a horizon of networked, ahistorical space of flows, aiming at imposing its logic over scattered, segmented places, increasingly unrelated to each other, less and less able to share cultural codes. Unless cultural and physical bridges are deliberately built between these two forms of space, we may be heading toward life in parallel universes whose times cannot meet because they are warped into different dimensions of a social hyperspace.1 Perhaps this schizophrenia is not as new as he thinks it is, but the problems he raises are real and call into question especially the possibility of fashioning community, the theme of the seventh chapter.2 Public space is essential for this task, a fact recognised from the creation of the Greek agora onwards.3 We have many public spaces of course, but fewer and fewer with resonance for civic society, and those we have are increasingly threatened by municipal neglect and vandalism.4 In the North, over all classes, the privatisation of space is a symptom of the problem. Space has become a dominant metaphor in contemporary Western culture, expressing its ruling individualism. Everyone wants their own \u2018space\u2019 and housing needs change accordingly.5 In Engels\u2019 Manchester, as in the Third World today, many families crowded into a single room and one toilet served and serves perhaps twenty or thirty families: now middle class families require a separate room for each member and some North American homes have more latrines than Third World houses have rooms. For the contemporary Westerner, says Brueggemann, \u2018\u201cSpace\u201d means an arena of freedom without coercion or accountability, free of pressures and void of authority. Space may be imaged as week end, holiday, avocation, and is characterized by a kind of 1 Ibid., p.428. 2 As Harvey remarks, the importance of the information revolution can easily be exaggerated (1 Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press 2000), p. 62). Castells5 space offlows and space of places call to mind earlier versions of local and global, universal and particular. Is it really the case, as Graham Ward assumes in Cites of God, that we are living in a radically new age, as far as cities are concerned, in which the older theologies of the city no longer have any relevance? 3 Kaviraj argues that the idea of\u2018the public\u2019 emerged in Europe in the eighteenth century [Filth, p. 86). The delimitation of public and private is much older, however, written into the Norman forest laws, the laws of common land and, in churches, into the distinction between nave, chancel and altar. We know that the naves of medieval churches were \u2018public space\u2019 in the fullest possible sense, used for a wide variety of\u2018secular\u2019 purposes. 4 A clear example of this is what happened to Tompkins Park in New York, as detailed in chapter 7. In Britain the increasing neglect of public parks, and the elimination of \u2018park keepers\u2019 from municipal budgets, mark a change in perceptions about the importance of public space. 5 3 \u00b0 Harries is more sympathetic to the need for private space in which we dwell \u2018at least for a time with our own dreams and thoughts\u2019. For that reason there is something inhuman about glass architecture. K. Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), p. 196. neutrality or emptiness waiting to be filled out by choosing.\u201931 Compare the Yagua of the Amazon who live in large open houses and who achieve \u2018privacy\u2019 through a convention whereby they become \u2018invisible\u2019 by turning away from the centre of the house.32 Empty space can be a positive asset, as Peter Brook has shown, putting it at the heart of theatre,33 but the emptiness Brueggemann speaks of arises from the absolutisation of \u2018choice\u2019. It is not humankind faced with \u2018two ways\u2019, as Deuteronomy suggested, but facing the rows of supermarket shelves. It is an absence of any transcendent referent. The priority of space in the North is bound up, as David Harvey points out, with the ideology of private property, which secures our exclusive rights to dominate a parcel of space. The reason that car and home ownership make such an attractive combination, he adds, is that it ensures an individualised ability to command and protect space simultaneously.34 The same ideology accords purpose to all the individual buildings of an area houses, factories, shops, schools and churches without their serving together the total life of the community. The recovery of new and more creative forms of social space, therefore, hangs on the emergence of a different kind of ideology, a new vision of the human. \u2018All theology is anthropology.\u2019 Does its failure to impinge on the space of our everyday world rest, as suggested in the previous chapter, on the presumption of a fundamental difference between sacred and secular space? SACRED SPACE AND SECULAR SPACE? \u2018The earth is the Lord\u2019s and all that is in it\u2019 (Ps. 24.1). The implication of this affirmation seems to be that, as argued in the previous chapter, there can be no division between secular and sacred space, no territories which can be carved up between God and Caesar \u2014 an implication crucial to Jesus\u2019 famous answer to the Pharisees (Mark 12.13b). God as Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer is to be found in all space and all space is grounded and has its origin in God. And yet most, if not all, cultures have sacred spaces springs, wells, groves, mountains, churches, mosques, temples. Can we in fact dispense with an account of sacred space? In his defence of sacred space Mircea Eliade appeals to the story of the burning bush: \u2018Come no closer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place on which you are standing is holy ground\u2019 (Exod. 3.5). 3 1 W. Brueggemann, The Land (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1977), p. 5. 3 2 A. Rapoport, House, Form and Culture (New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1969), p. 66. 33 P. Brook, The Empty Space (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972). 34 Harvey, Urban Experience, p. 197. Anthropologists find stories like this in every culture. As opposed to such sanctified spaces \u2018there are other spaces that are not sacred and so are without structure or consistency, amorphous... For religious man, this spatial nonhomogeneity finds expression in the experience of an opposition between space that is sacred the only real and real ly existing space and all other space, the formless expanse surrounding it\u2019.1 This experience of the non homogeneity of space, Eliade claims, is primordial, and it is this alone which allows the constitution of a world, revealing the central axis for all future orientation. \u2018When the sacred manifests itself in any hierophany... there is also revelation of an absolute reality... The manifestation of the sacred ontologically founds the world.\u20192 The claim is, then, that we cannot do without Eliot\u2019s \u2018still point of the turning world\u2019. The chaos of the homogeneity and relativity of profane space cannot sustain a world. A profane world is therefore, for Eliade, a contradiction in terms: it lacks the form imposed on chaos to make a world. Hegel agrees. For him \u2018 [t]he task of architecture is to build a bridge between humanity and divinity, to provide both individual and community with an integrating centre\u2019.37 Now it is quite clear that space is not all on a level. Eliade instances the familiar image of a church. You step off the street and you are in a \u2018different world\u2019, a difference which can be accentuated by stained glass, candles and incense. Here in these \u2018sacred\u2019 precincts the profane world is transcended. But we have to ask whether \u2018sacred\u2019 space can be as precisely physically located as Eliade claims. In addition to space which is overtly religious there is other space which has religious or pseudo religious significance. If sport is an ersatz religion, is a football stadium sacred or profane? What was going on when Anfield Road, in Liverpool, was filled with flowers after the Hillsborough disaster? Did Kensington Gardens become a sacred place when the same thing happened after the death of Princess Diana? Further, Eliade\u2019s categorisation of sacred space seems too formalised for the sacred space we actually experience. In the first place, memory plays a crucial part. People often feel that ancient churches are \u2018sacred\u2019 because they are places where \u2018prayer has been valid\u2019 they represent a tradition 1 M. Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane (New York: Harcourt &amp; Brace, 1959), p. 20. According to Eliade four features mark all sacred space: first, a break in the homogeneity of space which is, secondly, symbolised by an opening by which a passage from one cosmic region to another is made possible (this may mean nothing more than the opening of a church door off the street); thirdly, communication with heaven is expressed by one or another of certain images, all of which refer to the axis mundi: pillar, ladder, mountain, tree, vine and so on; and finally, around this cosmic axis lies the world, hence this axis is located \u2018in the middle\u2019 at the navel of the earth (p. 37). 2 Ibid., p. 21. 37 Harries, Function, p. 140, referring to Hegel\u2019s Lectures on Aesthetics. of engagement with the transcendent which engages us in turn. It is this, I would argue, which we cannot do without rather than Eliade\u2019s sacrality. In 1966 the architect Denys Lasdun noted that \u2018the important thing about buildings of the past is the character that they give a place... without a sense of place there can be no sense of belonging\u2019.38 This sense of place has been at the centre of much of the discussion of space in the past thirty years. Walter Brueggemann makes a fundamental distinction between space, which we use as a category, and \u2018place\u2019. Place is space which has historical meanings, in which important words have been spoken which have established identity, defined vocation, envisioned destiny... Place is indeed a protest against the unpromising pursuit of space. It is a declaration that our humanness cannot be found in escape, detachment, absence of commitment and undefined freedom.39 In Scripture \u2018there is no timeless space but there also is no spaceless time. There is rather storied place, that is a place which has meaning because of the history lodged there. There are stories which have authority because they are located in a place.\u201940 It is not a profane world which is a contradiction in terms but a world which has lost its memory. Without memory, \u2018chaos is come again\u2019. Quite independently, Christian Norberg Schultz mounted a similar argument, appealing to Heidegger. For him the purpose of architecture is to create \u2018dwelling\u2019. Human beings \u2018dwell\u2019 when they experience the environment as meaningful, and this happens when spaces become places. A place is a space which has a distinct character. Sacred places orientate us and help us find identity. \u2018In man\u2019s understanding of nature we thus recognize the origin of a concept of space as a system of places. Only a system of meaningful places makes a truly human life possible.\u201941 Of course these grand statements only have any significance when we try and translate them to apply to council estates, tower blocks, favellas and so forth. Stripped of the fancy rhetoric what all this means is that people en story and en soul their places and then, in the course of the dialectic of material life, their places en soul them. Because this is the case, new sacred places emerge, and some sacred places lose their aura, as stories lose their power to move. It is doubtful if anyone today experiences a theophany in the remains of the temple of Capitoline Venus, for example. And turning a shrine into a museum is 38 Quoted in F. W. Dillistone, Traditional Symbols and the Contemporary World (London: Epworth, 1973), p. 85. 39 Brueggemann, The Land, p. 185. 40 Ibid. 41 G. Norberg Schultz, Genius Loci (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), p. 28. as good a way as any of \u2018de sanctifying\u2019 it a key problem currently for congregations who need to appeal to English Heritage for funds to restore their churches. There are also, it seems, spaces which are properly sacred to individuals, but not to society as a whole one thinks, for example, of Thomas Hardy\u2019s After a Journey, one of his poignant laments for his first wife. The transcendent dimension here is, as it is paradigmatically in Scripture, bound up with relationship, and it is memory which marks the place out as \u2018sacred\u2019.1 Because space is a social and ideological reality, and not simply, as it was believed for centuries to be, either a container for all possible objects, or a category of our thinking, it has a history, both individual and corporate, in which the secular and the sacred are deeply intertwined. Fundamental to a Christian understanding of sacred space has to be the puzzling verse in John 4: Jesus said to her, \u2018Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem... [t]he hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth... (4.21, 23) This passage does not mean, as it has sometimes been taken to do, that henceforward there is worship of an undifferentiated God undifferenti atedly omnipresent. Karl Barth insisted that it had to be read Christo logically: \u2018The opposite of Jerusalem and Gerizim and all temples made with hands... is not the universe at large... but Jesus.\u2019 This does not mean, however, that space ceases to be important, to be replaced, in Calvinist fashion, only by the \u2018word of the Cross\u2019. On the contrary, we have only to glance at the way in which the terms \u2018spirit\u2019 and \u2018truth\u2019 are used elsewhere in St John\u2019s gospel and we shall see that it is worship of God mediated through Jesus as the One who makes everything known to us... God does not cease to dwell in the world in definite and distinct ways... He does not cease to be in special places.2 These \u2018special places\u2019 are those of individual and community encounter, as I have argued. There is also the question whether what Eliade identifies as sacred space is as crucial as he maintains. \u2018The manifestation of the sacred 1 Calling attention to relationship as the true locus of transcendence may seem obvious, but we should think of Kant\u2019s \u2018starry heavens\u2019 and the Romantic approach to the sublime, as in Wordsworth\u2019s Prelude. Human relationships play no part here. 2 K. Barth, Church Dogmatics II/1 (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1957), p. 481. ontologically founds a world... The chaos of the homogeneity and relativity of profane space cannot sustain a world.\u2019 This could be read as a way of defining what is to count as sacred. Laurie Lee\u2019s evocation of the village of Sladd, for example (in Cider with Rosie) or Alison Uttley\u2019s account of the Derbyshire farmhouse of her childhood (in The Country Child) both undeniably constitute a \u2018world\u2019 in the fullest sense Eliade could require but overtly sacred space (i.e. the local church) is entirely peripheral to both. There is nothing amorphous or lacking in structure about these spaces. In both cases the domestic kitchen is the true focus of shared life. Sennett suggests that it was the industrial revolution which made the home the secular version of spiritual refuge, shifting the notion of sanctuary from church to domestic interior.1 But is the sanctity of \u2018secular\u2019 space not implicit in ancient notions of hospitality, carried over and raised to a higher power in the upper room and the house churches of the first and second centuries? Is this not what was signified in the lares and penates of Roman religion, and the significance of the domestic shrines of contemporary Hinduism? I would say, rather, that all space is potentially sacred, waiting for the moment of encounter in which it mediates God. We can understand it through the same analogy by which Barth understands Scripture. Scripture is not per se the Word of God, he said, but it becomes it, as the water of the pool of Bethesda healed when the angel stirred it. If that is the case, then sacred space is bound up with event, with community, and with memory. What we conventionally understand as sacred spaces have a sacramental significance with regard to all other space: they are a reminder of the potential for epiphany of all other spaces. THE DIVINE GROUNDING OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF SPACE For much of Christian history John\u2019s claim that \u2018God is Spirit\u2019 has been taken to mean that whilst God may have created space God in Godself must be \u2018above\u2019 it \u2014 space less \u2014 in the same way that God is \u2018above\u2019 time. But this leaves our spatiality without theological grounding and by implication a matter of secondary or penultimate significance. If God does not possess time in a pre eminent sense, Karl Barth argued, then the reality of our own time is threatened. Similarly, to fully appreciate our own spatiality we need a theology of the \u2018eminent spatiality\u2019 of God. 1 R. Sennett, The Conscience of the Eye (New York: Norton, 1990), p. 21. Talk of divine \u2018space\u2019 seemed nonsense not just in the classical tradition of Christian theology, but to the theologians of secularisation, who argued that space and time stand necessarily in tension. Thus Harvey Cox argued that in the Hebrew bible YHWH was divested of spatiality and this meant that he could not be localised at any given geographic spot. Rather, God travelled with God\u2019s people.1 Opposing divine spatiality was part of the struggle with the nature religions of Canaan which, in investing the divine with spatiality, sanctioned royal power and the status quo. Christianity originally maintained the hostility to divine spatiality of the Hebrew bible, but part of the Constantinian \u2018fall\u2019 was \u2018a fatal respa tialization\u2019 of Christianity. Its \u2018non spatial genius\u2019 was not rediscovered even at the Reformation. For that it had to wait for the twentieth century and the secular city. Of course Cox had a point. Ideologies of space can be used to sanction the status quo, and indeed if we want a classical example of the way that happens we need look no further than 1 Kings chapter 8, Solomon\u2019s invocation of God at the dedication of the temple. But Cox misses Lefebvre\u2019s insight that if space is produced, then in dealing with space we are dealing with history. \u2018Space\u2019 is neither the container of all reality, as in the Platonic tradition, nor the sum of the dimensions and relations of objects, as it is for Kant, but a way of understanding political reality. The Conquest traditions of the Hebrew Scriptures, as well as the history books, ought to have made that clear. The idea that \u2018Hebrew thought\u2019 privileges time over space, a commonplace of the mid twentieth century, can be seen now for what it was, a product of an essentially historicist or existentialist reading of the texts which missed half of what there was to hear. A hint that there might be a divine spatiality is given by the frequent use of the preposition \u2018in\u2019 in Scripture. \u2018In God\u2019, said St Paul on the Areopagus, \u2018we live and move and have our being\u2019 (Acts 17). Here he is echoing, if not directly quoting, Stoic views and this highlights the problem which Christianity has always had with the divine spatiality. For Stoicism was pantheistic, and pantheism ultimately identifies the universe and God. Both Christianity and Judaism, however, have insisted that God is not a member of this or any universe. They have, then, on the one hand affirmed God\u2019s omnipresence, but at the same time been chary of discussing the implications this has for space. So for Aquinas God\u2019s omnipresence in the first instance follows from the fact that God is the cause of all existence. \u2018Since it is God\u2019s nature to exist, he it must 1 H. Cox, The Secular City (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1968), p. 69. be who properly causes existence in creatures, just as it is fire itself sets other things on fire... Now existence is more intimately and profoundly interior to things than anything else... So God must exist and exist intimately in everything.\u201946 So God fills all places by giving existence to everything occupying those places. Thomas appeals to the analogy of the soul and the body: as the soul exists wholly everywhere in the body, so God exists wholly in each and every thing. We can say that \u2018God exists in everything by power ( perpotentiam) inasmuch as everything is subject to his power (eiuspotestati subduntur), by presence inasmuch as everything is naked and open to his gaze, and by substance inasmuch as he exists in everything causing their existence\u2019.47 Divine spatiality, on this account, is primarily a matter of God\u2019s esse, which sustains in being all that is, and of the creative power that implies. It is not actually about place. Drawing on the biblical language which talks of God\u2019s own place Karl Barth outlined a theology of divine spatiality which offers a theological grounding for all forms of created space, and therefore for the built environment. In his discussion of time, Barth talks of God\u2019s \u2018eminent temporality\u2019, God\u2019s preceding, accompanying and coming after time, and it is this divine temporality, according to him, which grounds our own temporality. In the same way it is God\u2019s \u2018eminent spatiality\u2019 which grounds our own created spatiality. Space, in other words, is not something contingent, something which will one day be annihilated and \u2018be no more\u2019, because it has its true and intrinsic ground in God. God is present to other things, and is able to create and give them space, because God in Godself possesses space apart from everything else.48 What truth, Barth asks, could correspond to phrases like \u2018in Christ\u2019, \u2018in God\u2019 and \u2018in the Spirit\u2019 if God were not genuinely and primordially spatial? \u2018If it is not an incidental or superfluous belief that we can obtain space from God and find space in him, but a truth which is decisive for the actuality of creation, reconciliation and redemption and the trustworthiness of the Word of God, we cannot evade the recognition that God himself is spatial.\u201949 Here, if I am not mistaken, Barth has gone beyond any of his predecessors. The spatiality of God, and therefore the spatiality of creation, is not monochrome. God is present \u2018to everything with a presence which is not uniform but distinct and differentiated\u2019.50 What the tradition calls \u2018omnipresence\u2019 \u2018is not a shroud which is itself unmoved... On the contrary, it is itself that which moves and is moved, which is the real mover 46 Aquinas, Summa Thmhpm ia 8.1. 47 Ibid.ia8.3. 48 Barth, ChurchDogmabcsll/i, p. 474. 49 Ibid., p. 475. 50 Ibid., p. 473. and object of movement in this totality.\u201951 In relation to the previous discussion of sacred space this both means that God is free to be present in some places in a way which God is not in others, but precisely because this is a matter of the divine freedom it rules out the possibility of this being a matter of manipulation. Barth\u2019s account of the divine spatiality is explicitly Trinitarian. The origin of all space, according to him, is to be found in the Trinitarian relations. It is the fact that God is present to Godself, that there is a divine proximity and remoteness, which is the basis and presupposition of created proximity and remoteness.52 God\u2019s omnipresence is to be understood primarily as a determination of God\u2019s love, in so far as God is not only one, unique and simple, but as such is present to Godself and therefore present to everything which by God is outside God.53 God\u2019s omnipresence is the perfection in which he is present, and in which he, the One, who is distinct from and preeminent over anything else, possesses a place, his own place, which is distinct from all other places and also preeminent over them all... God\u2019s presence necessarily means that he possesses a place, his own place, or... his own space... If God does not possess space, he can certainly be conceived as that which is one in itself and in all. But he cannot be conceived as the One who is triune, as the One who as such is the Lord of everything else.54 Unlike Aquinas, therefore, Barth has understood omnipresence primarily through relationality, and not through God\u2019s creative and sustaining power. As triune, God possesses space. God in turn gifts space and time to us. Space is the form of creation in virtue of which, as a reality distinct from God, it can be the object of God\u2019s love.55 Following and developing Barth\u2019s ideas J\u00fcrgen Moltmann appeals to the kabbalistic notion of the tsimtsum, the space God makes within Godself for any other reality. God is therefore \u2018the dwelling place of the world created by him\u2019.56 If God is omnipresent, then creation cannot be \u2018outside\u2019 God. Later Moltmann gave this a more explicitly Trinitarian cast, appealing to the Trinitarian \u2018inexistentid, the indwelling of the Persons in each other. God, therefore, creates a space which \u2018corresponds to his inner indwellings\u2019.57 Space is not identical with God, as in pantheism, 51 Ibid., p. 477. 52 Ibid., p. 463. Tillich also thought of space in terms of relations [On Art and Architecture (New York: Crossroad, 1989), p. 84), as does a secular thinker like Doreen Massey (1 Space, Place and Gender (Cambridge: Polity, 1994), pp. 264 5). 53 Barth, Church Dogmatics II/1, p. 464. 54 Ibid., p. 468. 55 Ibid., p. 465. 56 J. Moltmann, Godin Creation, tr. M. Kohl (London: SCM, 1985), p. 149. 57 J. Moltmann, The Coming of God, tr. M. Kohl (London: SCM, 1996), p. 299. but the dimension of God\u2019s omnipresence. \u2018Absolute space\u2019 means the direct presence of God in the whole material world and in every individual thing within it.58 Here he is not far from Aquinas. But he goes further in arguing that a space for the created world comes into being which is neither the uncreated omnipresence of God nor the relative space of objects. The created world does not exist in the \u2018absolute space\u2019 of the divine being but in the \u2018ceded space\u2019 of God\u2019s world presence.59 This account makes clearer than does Aquinas that the space we occupy is grace, a gift. As I have argued, grace has a radical political dimension: if something is gift it cannot be possessed, owned, hung on to, counted as \u2018mine\u2019 as opposed to \u2018yours\u2019, and when it comes to territory this proves to be a vital principle. According to Ecclesiastes, everything has its time, and Moltmann extends this to the recognition that everything has its space also. Instead of beginning with God\u2019s freedom, like Barth, Moltmann proposes an ecological concept of space, in which every created reality has its own proper environment. Creatures too, however, have their own Hnexistentia\u2019 and so \u2018 [e]very human person exists in community with other people, and is also for them a living space. Every living thing is as the subject of its own life the object for other life as well.\u201960 space: theological and secular ontologies These accounts of created space bring theology into dialogue with those geographers, such as David Harvey and Edward Soja, who are led to an ontology of space from their concern with its social production. Readers allergic to metaphysics may want to go straight on to the next section (page 48), but since theology is concerned with the ground of all reality it cannot avoid it, and the work of these geographers invites us in this direction. Harvey appeals to Leibniz and Whitehead for a metaphysic which will lead towards a relational theory of space, place and environment. In Leibniz\u2019 theory of internal relations he finds four suggestive possibilities. Leibniz argues that space and time are mutually coordinate and that neither is more fundamental than the other. This allows a plurality of distinct spaces as opposed to a single all comprehending superspace, and also allows space and time to be viewed as ordering systems inherent within social practices that are \u2018chosen\u2019 rather than given. As 5 s Moltmann, Godin Creation, p. 154. 59 Ibid., p. 156. 60 Moltmann, Coming of God, p. 301. such it provides a framework through which we can understand the relations of production, consumption, exchange and distribution within capitalism.1 For Whitehead, who wrote, of course, after the discovery of relativity, space and time are relations derived from processes and events. What this means is that spatio temporality cannot be examined independently of processes. Spatial science cannot be divorced from the environment because \u2018space time, place and environment are all embedded in substantial processes whose attributes cannot be examined independently of the diverse spatio temporalities such processes contain\u2019.2 Soja goes not to Leibniz, but to existentialism and phenomenology, interestingly beginning with Buber. For Buber spatiality was the beginning of human consciousness, in that humans were unique in objectifying the world and setting themselves apart. \u2018This process of objectification defines the human situation and predicates it upon spatiality, on the capacity for detachment made possible by distancing, by being spatial to begin with.\u20193 4 5 All social theory, Soja suggests, springs from a chicken and egg dilemma between consciousness and the place which determines consciousness. Marxist geographers are unlikely to turn to Barth and Moltmann for an ontological grounding to their work, but both offer much which is pertinent to this discussion.\u00ae4 The problem, then, is to find an ontology which will ground an understanding of space as relationality, and allow us to understand it as at once produced, in process, and given. These theologians provide such an ontology. First, event and relation are Barth\u2019s two fundamental categories in speaking of God. With regard to the being of God, Barth insisted, \u2018the word \u201cevent\u201d ( Ereignis ) or \u201cact\u201d [A hi) is final, and cannot be surpassed or compromised. To its very deepest depths God\u2019s Godhead consists in the fact that it is an event... the event of his action, in which we have a share in God\u2019s revelation.\u2019\u00ae5 This event is an event of relation: As and before God seeks and creates fellowship with us, he wills and completes this fellowship in himself. In himself he is Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and therefore alive in his unique being with and for and in another... He does not 1 D. Harvey, Justice, Mature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), pp. 74, 250 5. 2 Ibid., pp. 263\u20144. 3 E. Soja, Postmodern Geographies (London: Verso, 1989), p. 132. The work of Buber\u2019s to which he refers is \u2018Distance and Relation\u2019, an article published in Psychiatry 20 (1957). 4 For Barth as a political and historical materialist thinker see my Karl Barth: Against Hegemony (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999). 5 Barth, Church Dogmatics II/1, p. 263. exist in solitude but in fellowship. Therefore what he seeks and creates between himself and us is in fact nothing else but what he wills and completes and therefore is in himself.1 Like Buber, though earlier and independently, Barth grounds spatial ity in \u2018togetherness at a distance\u2019. \u2018Presence as togetherness... includes distance. But where there is distance, there is necessarily one place and another place. To this extent God\u2019s presence necessarily means that he possesses a place... his own space.\u20192 As we have seen, space has its origin in this pattern of relations. Leibniz\u2019 metaphysic of space thinks of a world of internal relations in which each monad mirrors and reproduces all the relations there are. Harvey identifies three problems with this position, all of which are addressed by Barth. First, if everything is about flows, how are we to speak of individuals or particulars? Where Harvey has \u2018flows\u2019 here, Barth has \u2018relations\u2019. His ontology is one of the event of relationship, in which relationship and event are mutually defined. This means that individuals or particulars are a necessary part of the dialectic of reality. \u2018Space\u2019 is what makes individual existence possible: \u2018Space is the form of creation in virtue of which, as a reality distinct from God, it can be the object of his love.\u20193 Moltmann, for his part, proposes a perichoretic space of reciprocal in existence, so that community is the social space of reciprocal self development.\u00ae4 Secondly, Whitehead pointed out that in the case of internal relations everything depends on everything else and therefore we cannot know about anything until we know' about everything. But Barth, on the basis of revelation, posits an ontology in which everything is indeed related, but on the basis offreedom and choice (\u2018election\u2019). Relationality is affirmed as ultimate, in that God is relation, but this does not mean that everything depends on everything else. Everything is related, in Barth\u2019s view, in its dependence on the source of all reality, God, which is the truth the old doctrine of omnipresence sought to capture. \u2018God\u2019s omnipresence is bound up with the special nature of his presence in his revealing and reconciling work ontologically (in its reality)... It is only the One who is present in this special manner and place who is also the God present in the world as a whole\u2019 of all act and event.70 This particular problem does not, therefore, arise for Barth. 1 Ibid., p. 275. 2 Ibid., p. 468. 68 Ibid., p. 465. 2 69 Moltmann, Coming of God, p. 301. Perichoresis is the Greek term for the mutual indwelling of the 3 three persons of the Trinity, which Moltmann has already referred to as inexistenUa. 4 70 Barth, Church Dogmatics II/i, p. 478. Thirdly, if all monads internalise all there is, then they can only change under their own volition. How are we to account for change except by a series of unique and non related acts? Leibniz\u2019s account is self contradictory. Barth is freed from this internal contradiction because he does not presuppose Leibnizian monads but creatures made in the image of the One who loves in freedom, between whom there is a ceaseless interaction of\u2018secondary causation\u2019. \u2018Providence\u2019 is the account of God\u2019s overruling of all events as an accompanying, the ceaseless re weaving of all created acts of volition.1 To illustrate the practical significance of the Leibnizian doctrine Harvey instances the relations of consumption, exchange and distribution which are separate moments of a process in which each moment internalises the others. These moments, Harvey suggests, must be understood in their own right if an idealist view of internal relations is to be avoided.2 But this is precisely how Barth does understand relations. And because \u2018God\u2019, that is, the fundamental nature of reality and the being in whom space is grounded and takes its origin, is the one who loves in freedom then the space which is created is precisely one in which ordering systems are chosen rather than given (as they are with Leibniz). Again, as the one who loves in freedom the issue of power, which Foucault above all recognised as bound up with space, is directly addressed. Of course we have no need of the hypothesis. In the world we experience the distinction and relationship between the limited and that which limits it. If we find the essence of God in the non spatiality and timelessness of the basis of the world, this means neither more nor less than that God is drawn into the dialectic of the world\u2019s antithesis. But this leaves the way open for Feuerbach\u2019s question whether God might not be man rather than man in God, and to this question there is no decisive answer. If the only thing which exists is this antithesis which comprehends God, the relativity of the two spheres cannot prevent us from ascribing now to the one and now the other the dignity and function of deity. And this necessarily is what has happened and will always happen apart from the knowledge of revelation and faith.73 The Triune God is not to be understood simply as the negative of our experience of space and time, but as its creative origin and ground, and therefore as the possibility of its eschatological redemption. We are invited to understand our experience therefore in and through the narrative 1 K. Barth, Church Dogmatics III /% (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1961), pp. 90 154. 2 Harvey, Justice^ pp. 73 4 73 Barth, Church Dogmatics II/1, p. 467. of this God\u2019s creative engagement in creation, incarnation and at Pentecost. A TRINITARIAN MAPPING OF SPATIALITY If we propose a theological, as opposed to a purely sociological or philosophical, reading of space this will be in virtue of the compelling power of the whole story. But the explanatory power of a Trinitarian understanding of God as a way of understanding space is far from negligible. Developing the suggestions outlined at the end of the previous chapter I suggest that the following represents a Trinitarian mapping of spatiality which might ground the kind of revolutionary practice which Lefebvre, Harvey and Soja all seek. God the Creator is the one who brings order out of chaos, the structuring of space by form which we shall consider in detail in chapter 6. Because God has often not been understood as the One who loves in freedom, but rather as \u2018sole ruler of the universe\u2019, this activity has been thought of as a form of Stalinist central planning. Not by accident has the reaction to modernity alleged that human beings have wanted to \u2018play God\u2019, and not least in the built environment. But the order which emerges from the God who loves in freedom is much more akin to the consultative process which generated the Liverpool re build mentioned 74 \u2018What distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality\u2019 (Capital Vt I ch. 7). above, which was fully consultative from the start. \u2018Would that all the Lord\u2019s people were prophets\u2019 (Num. 11.29) is the decisive text for the ordering process in the light of the Trinitarian revelation, as Blake saw. God the Reconciler takes flesh in order to teach peace to the nations. Alienation, domination and reconciliation can all be and are expressed in the built environment. In the \u2018Christian\u2019 middle ages Jews were herded into ghettoes; in corporate housing in much of the twentieth century domestic architecture underlined the fact that there were second class citizens; many traditional societies had male and female \u2018sides\u2019 or social space and, as Dolores Hayden and Daphne Spain have illustrated, this remains an issue. If reconciliation is to go beyond pious talk it needs to take shape in the built environment where social justice is, quite literally, made concrete. But peace, as Richard Sennett has helped us to see, is not about the absence of difference and even conflict, but rather about what we do with it, how we live with it and harness it creatively. Imagination, order, and justice are, then, the keywords of a Trinitarian theology of space and the built environment in which the relational event which grounds all reality, God, seeks correspondence. In the remainder of the book I want to see if it is possible to make sense of that claim in relation to the land in which we dwell, the dwellings we live in and the settlements we create. CHAPTER 3 The land The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants. (Leviticus 25.23) Space is constructed, but land, property, territory, is possessed. After an ontology of space the most fundamental presupposition of any theology of the built environment and potentially the most politically explosive is a theology of the land. Without land we cannot live, but how is it to be allocated and husbanded? Hilaire Belloc described human beings as \u2018land animals\u2019 because \u2018[t]he very first condition of all, viz, mere space in which to extend his being, involves the occupation of land\u2019.1 The problem is that, even before pressures of population became serious, land for some has, at least since the agricultural revolution in Neolithic times, meant dispossession for others as it does today in the Balkans and in Palestine. And conquest has left the world littered with struggles for autonomy in Chechnya and Tibet, in Sri Lanka, in Kurdistan, in Sudan. Always and everywhere land is both vital for sustenance and for all the goods of identity, but at the same time one of the most obvious foci of aggression. Even in relatively peaceful and stable democracies land is problematic. In the early part of the twentieth century the right to roam over mountain and moorland was only established in Britain through mass campaigns, imprisonment, and the need to face much violence on the part of landowners\u2019 agents, and even today it leaves much to be desired. \u2018For the visitor\u2019, wrote Marion Shoard about Britain in 1997, \u2018the countryside remains largely inaccessible.\u20192 Everywhere inequality is inscribed in space, though perhaps rarely as dramatically as in England 1 H. Belloc in The Catholic Encyclopaedia (New York: Universal Knowledge Foundation, 1913), vol. viii, p. 775. 2 M. Shoard, This Land is Our Land (London: Gaia, 1997), p 474 and Scotland, a situation which can still be traced largely to the impact of the Norman invasion of 1066! Half of Scotland\u2019s 19 million acres is owned by 608 land owners, and 10 per cent by 18.1 In England the top 1 per cent of the population own nearly two thirds of the land.2 Details of ownership are shrouded in secrecy. \u2018If we based our knowledge on information offered by landowners or by Government\u2019, comments Richard Norton Taylor, \u2018we would have little idea about who, and how many, owns the land today.\u20193 Many ideologies, theological and otherwise, have been framed to justify this situation, for inequality in land ownership is not self evident. According to social anthropologists human beings have existed as hunter gatherers for the vast majority of their history.4 Hunter gatherers live, where they still exist, in egalitarian, non patriarchal and non property owning communities and archaeological evidence suggests that ancient communities were the same. Was it a memory of this situation which led to the myth of the golden age when, as Virgil put it, \u2018no peasants subdued the fields; it was not lawful even to assign or divide the ground with landmarks: men sought the common gain, and the earth itself bore everything more generously at no one\u2019s bidding\u2019 (Georgies I)? This Eden, like hunter gatherer society, knows no agriculture. The problem with it is that hunting and food gathering sustain less than ten people per acre. The agricultural revolution was necessary for human development and expansion, for real growth in the quality of life, but it is this revolution which begets the \u2018Fall\u2019 into inequality: on this fact all are agreed. The puzzle is to know how to interpret it. Why was the emergence of stratification necessary? Two current suggestions are that \u2018aggrandising\u2019 individuals subordinated others, which we can call the \u2018fatal flaw\u2019 theory, or that some families slowly grew worse off by a combination of factors, the \u2018hard luck\u2019 theory.5 On the first view, competition occurs where abundant resources can be converted into scarcer, desirable goods or services. In the context of competitive feasting excess subsistence resources are converted into desirable resources and, as research amongst existing hunter gatherers has indicated, \u2018ambitious 1 A. Wightman, Who Owns Scotland (Edinburgh: Canongate, 1996); R. Callander, How Scotland is Owned (Edinburgh: Canongate, 1998). 2 Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth, report No. 7, 1979. The Commission was abolished three months into the Thatcher government. 3 R. Norton Taylor, Whose Land is it Anyway? (Wellingborough: Turnstone, 1982), p. 28. 4 K. Sale, Human Scale (London: Seeker &amp; Warburg, 1980), p. 182, citing a lecture by Ren\u00e9 Dubos. 5 Brian Hayden represents the first theory: \u2018Competition, Labor, and Complex Hunter Gatherers\u2019, in E. Burch and L. Ellanna Berg (eds.), Key Issues in Hunter Gatherer Research (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994), pp. 223\u201443; Peter Bogucki represents the second: The Origins of Human Society (Oxford: Blackwell, 1999). individuals vie with one another for control over excess resources, labor, and the wealth and power that such control confers\u2019.8 On the second view, settled communities were organised around households whose relative position was constantly changing. Illness, failure to capitalise on new developments such as animal traction, or sheer bad luck, could lead to downward mobility in which households would sink below existing norms of accumulation of property and prestige. In what are called \u2018transegalitarian societies\u2019, in which full equality is no longer in place, but there is no developed social stratification either, asymmetries of power would slowly consolidate. \u2018Wise decision making and good luck would have played a critical role.\u20199 If the \u2018hard luck\u2019 theory is right, then it was not violence, envy, cupidity or any other vice which was responsible for the \u2018Fall\u2019, no sinister bias in human nature. It happened imperceptibly, perhaps over millennia. As social complexity and the level of surplus increased, however, so did inequality. Significantly, societies which did not generate significant surpluses did not generate the same kind of inequality. Visiting Norway at the end of the eighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft discovered that \u2018[t]he Norwegians appear to me the most free community I have ever observed\u2019.10 The foundation of this freedom, as it had been in tribal Israel and large parts of Europe, was security of tenure for the peasant farmers who formed the bulk of the population. There was a (small) class divide in this society, and there was poverty and hardship, but not the vastly unequal pattern of land ownership which Norwegian ancestors foisted on much of the rest of Europe. The result is that class is to this day in Norway not the issue it is in a country like Britain.11 The absence of large fertile plains for farming probably has much to do with this, as it has with the observation that that there are no caste societies above 6,000 feet, as the local economy is too impoverished to sustain them.12 Neither of these theories calls in question Marx\u2019s response to something like the \u2018hard luck\u2019 theory: that \u2018primitive accumulation\u2019, which he 8 Hayden, \u2018Competition\u2019, p. 239. 9 Bogucki, Origins, p. 214. 10 M. Wollstonecraft, Letters written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway and Denmark (London, 1889), p. 63. 11 There is a debate about how real equality is in Norway. In a celebrated book, The Distant Democracy (London: Wiley, 1977), Willy Martinussen argued that Norway was in fact characterised by widespread apathy, alienation and social inequality These findings were challenged by W. Lafferty, Participation and Democracy in Norway (Oslo: Oslo University Press, 1981). Significantly, Norway exploited its oil resources as a government, without using the big oil companies, and the revenues have gone into social welfare and national infrastructure. The result is one of the few compelling examples of a rising tide lifting all boats. 12 D. Quigley, \u2018Is a theory of caste still possible?\u2019, in M. Searle Chatterjee and U. Sharma (eds.), Contextualising Caste (Oxford: Blackwell, 1995), pp. 38 9; H. Alavi, \u2018The two biraderis: kinship in rural West Punjab5, in T. N. Madan (ed.), Muslim Societies in South Asia (New Delhi: Vikas, 1994). read as the reality of original sin, quickly supervened. \u2018In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force, play the great part.\u20191 John Ball and Gerrard Winstanley had already suggested much the same thing.2 Lewis Mumford argued that the rise of inequality was greatly exacerbated by the rise of the city. Consequent upon the discovery of agriculture human beings lived for millennia primarily in villages, the mother of the human race, the place where ethics were first formed. But at some point a great elevation of the ruler and the priest took place: apparently after 3000B.C., when there was a similar expansion of human powers in many other departments. With this came vocational differentiation and specialization in every field. The early city, as distinct from the village community, is a caste managed society, organized for the satisfaction of a dominant minority: no longer a community of humble families living by mutual aid.3 I shall return to this rather romanticised view of the village in the fifth chapter. The development of agriculture not only led to inequality, it also raised the question of land use, illustrated by the story of Cain and Abel. There pastoralists and agriculturalists have to allocate land between them, and murder is the result. With the coming of kings, land is set apart for royal use, and we have land which exists purely for pleasure. The Norman conquerors of Britain appropriated huge areas of forest for hunting, dispossessing existing communities and criminalising access. The story 1 \u2018This primitive accumulation plays in Political Economy about the same part as original sin in theology. Adam bit the apple, and thereupon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living. The legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow; but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential...Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property.5 K. Marx, Capital, vol. i, Pt 8, ch. 26. 2 Walsingham, a hostile witness, said that John Ball \u2018tried to prove...that from the beginning all men were created equal by nature and that servitude had been introduced by the unjust and evil oppression of men against the will of God... \u2019. Froissart, Chronicles, ed. G. Brereton (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1968), p. 212. Winstanley argued that buying and selling land \u2018was brought in by war5; \u2018For the power of inclosing Land, and owning Property, was brought into Creation by your Ancestors by the Sword; which first did murther their fellow creatures, Men, and after plunder or steal away their land.5 A Declaration from the Poor Oppressed people of England, in Gerrard Winstanley, Selected Writings (London: Aporia, 1989), p. 26. 3 L. Mumford, The City inHistory (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p. 50. of Solomon illustrates the need to allocate land for \u2018defence capability\u2019 (i Kgs 9.19), another continuing theme throughout human history. However land inequalities arose, the question today is how to deal with them. In areas such as North and South America, Australia and New Zealand, and Zimbabwe, where primitive accumulation happened relatively recently, and indigenous peoples were dispossessed by white settlers, there has been since the 1970s a global movement to reverse the injustices by which land was taken from them. At the heart of this movement\u2019, Leonie Sandercock notes, \u2018there are land claims that are profoundly or potentially destabilizing of established practices of land use planning, land management, and laws of private property.\u20191 The same might be said of challenges to ownership in the North, which is why access to land was criminalised in Britain in 1994. Urgent questions of another sort are raised by current practices of land use, especially in the North. Increasingly there is the question of whether there will be enough land to feed the world\u2019s burgeoning population. Cities, in which slightly more than half the world\u2019s population now live, are parasitic on the countryside which supplies their food. But as they grow, so some of the most fertile of the earth\u2019s land disappears under concrete, whilst naturally dry land is used by exploiting precious, and effectively non renewable, aquifer resources. Should derelict areas in cities be developed as high intensity housing, or turned into urban farms to improve the environment? Should forests be felled to enable ranching, as is still happening in Brazil? How can we arrive at a proper valuation of these resources? If they are truly global, will the global community fund them? The theological importance of these questions is illustrated by the fact that the issue of land is central to the Hebrew bible. \u2018In the whole of the Hexateuch\u2019, wrote von Rad in 1943, \u2018there is probably no more important idea than that expressed in terms of the land promised and later granted by Yahweh.\u20192 3 Walter Brueggemann agrees with von Rad\u2019s assessment. Land is, he says, \u2018a central, if not the central theme of biblical faith\u2019.'8 What, then, does it have to say to our condition? 1 L. Sandercock, Towards Cosmopolis (Chichester: John Wiley, 1998), p. 17. 2 G. von Rad, The Problem of the Hexateuck and other Essays (Edinburgh: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1966), p. 79. Avery different understanding of the significance of land, though one I shall not explore here, is proposed by Elaine Scarry. What makes \u2018the land5 such a resonant category, she says, is that it is almost God\u2019s body, a separate form of substantiation. God confirms God\u2019s existence by the gift of the land. The Body in Pain (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 195. Put like this land is almost an anticipation of the incarnation. It functions as gift in an even stronger sense than Brueggemann argues for. 3 W. Brueggemann, The Land (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1977), p. 3. IDEOLOGIES OF THE LAND IN THE HEBREW BIBLE Redactor is Rabbenu: the fundamental rule for reading Scripture, which anticipates the \u2018canonical criticism\u2019 of the past thirty years. Scripture, as it is read in the church, is read as an interconnected whole, and not, as scholars have taught us to read it, as a collage of documents, heavily edited, from many different periods. In contemporary reading, however, these results cannot be ignored, and we return to the whole only in the light of the various modes of critical study. Gerhard von Rad discerned a twofold theology of the land. The first he derived from cultic circles, and this views the land as God\u2019s property. We find this view in Leviticus, though it certainly has earlier roots: \u2018 [T] he land is mine; with me you are but aliens and tenants\u2019 (Lev. 25.23). According to this theology, earth and soil were not tribal property but were the gift of YHWH, and held in fief by Israel. The laws regarding harvest firstlings (Exod. 23.19), tenths (Exod. 22.28), the leaving of gleanings (Lev. ig.gff.) all emphasise this same understanding \u2014 they constitute a recognition of YHWH\u2019s right to ownership. In line with this tradition is the view that Israel too is God\u2019s property or inheritance (Deut. 9.26). The second tradition he called \u2018historical\u2019. This is the view that the land is Israel\u2019s heritage, promised by God to the patriarchs. Since it belongs to God, God\u2019s commandments must be observed if Israel is to live in the land. According to the Deuteronomists it was the wickedness of the earlier inhabitants which led to their expulsion and if Israel was not obedient it would suffer the same fate (Deut. 9.4; 4.40). Fifty years on from this study, Norman Habel has offered a still more complex analysis of six ideologies of the land which he finds in the Hebrew bible, which come from different milieux and offer significantly different insights.1 Common to many of them is the description ofland as nahalah, usually translated as \u2018inheritance\u2019. Habel defines the term thus: \u2018A nahalah, in its primary meaning, is not something simply handed down from generation to generation, but the entitlement or rightful property of a party that is legitimated by a recognized social custom, legal process, or divine charter.\u2019 The terms he prefers to use to translate it are \u2018portion\u2019, \u2018share\u2019, \u2018entitlement\u2019, \u2018allotment\u2019, and \u2018rightful property\u2019.2 In the light of current discussions of a \u2018stakeholder economy\u2019 we could also use the phrase \u2018stake in the land\u2019. The first of Habel\u2019s categories is a royal ideology, justifying the rights to power of David\u2019s successors in Jerusalem. Here land is the source 1 N. Habel, The Land is Mine: Six Biblical Ideologies (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995) 2 Ibid., p. 35. of wealth for the royal family. In a piece of hyperbole which echoes the claims of the victory stelae of Assyrian and Babylonian kings the psalmist envisages the king of Israel as a world ruler: May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. (Ps. 72.8) Habel comments, \u2018The people, as a whole, have a right to the land as their entitlement from God. The monarch has a higher entitlement, which extends to the whole earth. The rights of the ancestral families of the land are subsumed under the rights of the monarch to appropriate land needed to increase the wealth of the court.\u20191 The second is the theocratic ideology of Deuteronomy, according to which the land, specifically Canaan, of which YHWH is \u2018the owner\u2019, is an unearned gift. This gift, however, is conditional on good behaviour, and can be revoked. Land itself can form a temptation if it becomes a source of sufficiency other than God (Deut. 8.11 20). Peasant landholders have an entitlement, a nahalah, as their stake in YHWH\u2019s gift but \u2018[a]ny Canaanites who happen to survive the wars of YHWH are destined to survive as slave labour with no obvious rights to power or property (Dt 21.10\u2014n)\u2019.22 Within the community the Levites have special status as a landless elite claiming power over the landed, evoking echoes of Plato\u2019s guardians, who have power but no property. Third, Habel picks out what he calls the \u2018ancestral household ideology\u2019 of Joshua, according to which land is a cluster of family lots in Canaan promised by YHWH. The similarity to the peasant holdings of Deuteronomy is obvious. \u2018Each entitlement, given by divine lot according to the command of Moses, apparently becomes the inheritance of its ancestral family and household in subsequent generations. Thus the ideology of the book of Joshua provides a charter for ancestral households to claim these inherited lands as territory given by divine decree, regardless of what may have happened to the ownership of these lands over time.\u201923 Deuteronomy constantly urges that the Ganaanites \u2014 considered the source of Israel\u2019s idolatry and downfall should be driven out. That is bad enough, but here, says Habel, \u2018the terror ideology is relentless\u2019.24 In Jeremiah the land appears as YHWH\u2019s own nahalah, which Israel has abused. 1 Ibid., p. 32. 22 Ibid., p. 51. 23 Ibid., p. 57. 24 Ibid., p. 61. ... when you entered you defiled my land, and made my nahalah an abomination. CJer. 2.7) As a consequence the land suffers, and YHWH suffers with it. How long will the land mourn, and the grass of every field wither? For the wickedness of those who live in it the animals and birds are swept away... I have forsaken my house, I have abandoned my nahalah, I have given the beloved of my heart into the hands of her enemies. (Jer. 12.4,7) Jeremiah believes the land will be restored to Israel. At that time, though a reformed monarchy will be restored, power will not lie with the Levites nor with the king, but will be shared by the whole people as promised in the famous vision of the new covenant. In Leviticus 25\u20147 Habel finds an agrarian ideology in which, as in Deuteronomy, YHWH is the ultimate land owner, but where the land itself must keep the sabbath. \u2018By returning the land to its divine owner, the Israelites acknowledge their absolute dependency on the goodness and authority of the landowner.\u20191 YHWH\u2019s ownership means that no land can ever be sold in perpetuity. This is the foundation of the famous Jubilee legislation according to which land which has been lost because of debt slavery has to be restored every fiftieth year. This ideology assumes a town and country division, envisaging a situation in which peasant farmers will be completely free from domination by the urban elite. Leviticus makes a distinction between \u2018the land\u2019, which may not be sold in perpetuity (Lev. 25.23), and property within a walled city. This can be redeemed within a year of sale, but not thereafter. If it is not redeemed before a full year has elapsed, a house that is in a walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the purchaser, throughout the generations; it shall not be released in the jubilee. But houses in villages that have no walls around them shall be classed as open country; they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the jubilee. (Lev. 25.30 1) Finally, in the Abrahamic stories we have an \u2018immigrant ideology\u2019 where \u2018land is a host country where immigrant ancestors find God at 1 Ibid., p. 102. sacred sites, discern promises of future land, and establish peaceful relations with the indigenous peoples of the land\u2019.1 Abraham fosters a way of life which mediates blessing and creates peaceful relations with the owners of the land, the Canaanites. Curiously, both von Rad and Habel miss the point that the discussion of land in the Hebrew bible does not begin in Genesis 12, but with the creation narratives. According to the second creation story humankind Adam) is taken from the dust ( adamah ) \u2014 rooted, therefore, in the soil (Gen. 2.7). Adam\u2019 serves the adamah. Humankind has a special and absolutely necessary relationship to the soil: its vocation is defined in terms of tilling and caring for it (Gen. 2.15). This common rooting in the earth is the ground of human solidarity. But in the Genesis narrative this solidarity is at once challenged by the first murder. Abel\u2019s blood cries to God \u2018from the earth\u2019 (erez) the word which is usually used for the territory of a group, as in 'erez Israel\u2019, the land of Israel (Gen. 4.10). Cain has to flee this erez, becomes a wanderer, and establishes cities. But the memory of human solidarity remains rooted in the earth, which cries out for justice. Human solidarity is literally \u2018grounded\u2019, part of the earth we all tread and which sustains us all. How is this cry from the earth to be dealt with? The answer of the Hebrew bible is: through observing Torah, God\u2019s directions for everyday life. In doing this we fulfil our vocation, we serve the adamah, and then blood no longer cries out.2 Redactor is Rabbenu means that we begin with Genesis, and not with Exodus, with human solidarity in the soil, and the witness of the earth against dispossession. Humankind is rooted originally in the soil and not a particular land. \u2018Being bound to the earth is to be distinguished from being bound to a homeland. To be bound to the earth relates not to a place in which I am born and in which my children will be brought up... but to life according to Torah.\u20193 What can we take as common between these various ideologies? The first thing is the claim that the earth belongs to God and is therefore gift. As such it is a concrete form of what Protestantism spoke of as justification by faith, as Deuteronomy above all makes clear. According to the Deuteronomist Israel is given a land \u2018with fine, large cities that you did not build, filled with all sorts of goods houses that you did not fill, hewn cisterns that you did not hew, vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant\u2019 (Deut. 6.10 11). This is true not just of Canaan but of 1 Ibid., p. 135. 2 So K. P. Lehmann, \u2018Die Gerechten erben das Land5, in Texte undKontexte 80 4/98, p. 20. 3 A. Wolf Steger, \u2018Gegen den Ausverkauf des Landes5, in Texte und Kontexte 80 4/98, p. 6. every \u2018promised land\u2019. We do not live from our own righteousness but on the basis of God\u2019s free gift of grace. Land is not possession but gift. This constitutes \u2018the sign of a concrete grace... not abstract, but a historically real grace, which leads to the formulation of very precise directions for everyday life and to the offer of grace for all peoples\u2019.29 Though Israel is gifted the land, it dwells in it as a guest and not as a possessor. The inner relationship between promise, Torah and land constitutes the \u2018concrete Utopia\u2019 of the Bible, according to Klaus Peter Lehmann. This triangular relationship \u2018demythologises the relation of human beings to the land and constitutes it in terms of relations of righteousness, or more precisely, in terms of relationship to God\u2019.30 Secondly, we have seen that nahalah occurs in most of the ideologies Habel identifies. The principle of nahalah is that every family has its own, roughly equal, stake in the land. The history of primitive accumulation, recorded, amongst other places, in the history of Solomon and his successors, is the history of the end of this situation. What the prophets call \u2018doing justice\u2019 means finding a way to restore it. This is an absolutely concrete political imperative in almost every country on earth (China perhaps being an exception, if we exclude the occupation of Tibet). Implied in these ideas of gift and stakeholding is the Deuteronomic point that justice is required for Israel to dwell in the land in peace. What is primary is not possession and enjoyment, but obeying Torah, God\u2019s concrete guidelines for everyday life. To set those aside, every strand of the Hebrew bible emphasises, is to court disaster. Failure to obey Torah means they will be uprooted and cast into another land (Deut. 29.29) and the land itself will be cursed (Deut. 29.23). Finally, we live in a world awash with refugees, and many strands of the scriptural narrative speak directly to their condition. We see from the creation narrative that whilst borders may be needed for expediency, they cannot be absolute. Adamah comes before erez and has prior claim. Abraham, the founder of Israel, spends his life as a stateless person, trying to buy safety for himself even by compromising the integrity of his wife (Gen. 20). And the theme of the exile in Egypt constituted a fundamental ethical guideline for Israel in many directions, but not least in relation to the refugee: \u2018When an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt\u2019 (Lev. 19.34). But how is it possible to understand the gift of land as justificatio impii in the light of what Habel correctly identifies as texts of terror? A number of responses to this question may be made. The first, which has effectively been the strategy of liberation theology, is to adopt the thesis of Norman Gottwald that there never was a conquest, but that a small group of escaped slaves joined up with marauding bands coming down from the north and the peasantry of the Canaanite city states to overthrow the petty rulers of Canaan, and establish an egalitarian tribal federation, which lasted for something like two hundred years. Not conquest, then, but a people\u2019s revolution.1 Even if one is disposed to accept this reading of what actually happened, however, it does not change the way historically Scripture has been understood and acted upon, nor the way the text as it stands seems to ask to be read. However, if we follow the basic hermeneutic rule and read the part in the light of the whole, two things have to be said. First, it is obvious that the narrative as a whole, from the Abraham stories to the books ofNehemiah and Ezra, is framed by landlessness and dispossession. We are not reading a text written by conquerors, but by losers. At the beginning of the patriarchal narrative Abram leaves his father\u2019s house and native land to go to a land YHWH will show him. He becomes a wanderer without a stake in any land. Having acquired such a stake his descendants lose it due to famine, and are reduced to slavery in Egypt. This is reacquired at the conquest, but only in the context of an ongoing struggle with the Philistines. When this is over Israel survives uneasily in the midst of super power rivalry until the monarchy collapses and the leaders are taken into exile. Though the exiles returned Israel never enjoyed full autonomy again. It is in the period of exile and return that most of the texts in the Hebrew bible were redacted, if not written, and this has an important bearing on the preoccupation with the land, and on ideologies like those of Deuteronomy. The idea of driving out the Canaanites is a fantasy of the powerless. As Nietzsche saw, such fantasies may be poisonous, and have in fact been so at many points in Christian history when used as justification for mass slaughter and conquest. But of course they are only one strand in the text, and need to be read against the Servant Songs of Isaiah and the promises of universal reconciliation which likewise emerge at this time. There is a debate going on in Scripture which we need to listen to, and sometimes to take sides about. As an illustration of that fact we know that reading Scripture as a whole has in fact often legitimated quite different practices than those 1 N. Gottwald, The Tribes of Tahweh (London: SCM, 1979) of conquest and dispossession. Here is Thomas Bewick\u2019s description of a shepherd, Anthony Liddell, early in the nineteenth century: The whole cast of his character was formed by the Bible, which he had read with attention, through and through. Acts of Parliament which appeared to him to clash with the laws laid down in it, as the Word of God, he treated with contempt. He maintained that the fowls of the air and the fish of the sea were free for all men; consequently, game laws, or laws to protect the fisheries, had no weight with him.32 This use of Scripture as a guide to our approach to the land has, I would argue, been at least as important, if not more so, than that of the justification of possession. SPIRITUALISING THE LAND? Appeal to what Christians still call the \u2018Old Testament\u2019 is one thing. But is not everything different in the New? \u2018My kingdom is not from this world,\u2019 said Jesus (John 18.36). Does this not apply to land ownership? Is it perhaps the case that everything we learn in the Hebrew bible is relativised or even set at nought by the New Testament? Under conditions of alienation it is hardly surprising that the land might become a transcendental symbol. This is what W. D. Davies argues occurs in the New Testament period, and especially after lire sack of Jerusalem in ad 70. In Mishnah Sanhedrin 10.1, for example, \u2018inheriting the land\u2019 is equivalent to having a share in the world to come, whilst the Testament of Job clearly contrasts the present perishable world, including the land of Israel, with \u2018the glory that is imperishable\u2019.33 After ad 70, Davies argues, Pharisaism was \u2018prepared to adjust to the absence of the land\u2019 and effectively placed Torah above political power and the control of the land.34 But here too no one ideology held sway. There was, says Davies, \u2018no one doctrine of the land, clearly defined and normative, but... a multiplicity of ideas and expectations variously and unsystematically entertained\u2019. Some Jews continued to believe that land and promise were indissoluble, but not all. Nevertheless the connection between land and promise \u2018is not always to be \u201cspiritualized\u201d, but accorded its full terrestial or physical and historical actuality\u2019.35 On the whole Davies does not find evidence for this multiplicity of views in the New Testament. The terminology of promised land plays 1 1 2 Cited in R. Williams, The Country and the City (London: Hogarth, 1985), p. 100. 33 W. D. Davies, The Gospel and the Land (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974), p 125. 34 Ibid., pp. 127 8. 35 Ibid., p. 157. little part there, nor does erez Israel. Only in Stephen\u2019s speech in Acts 7 is \u2018land\u2019 a major theme. This speech is at first sight a curious rendering of Israel\u2019s history which concentrates on the patriarchs, and then moves very swiftly over the occupation and the reigns of David and Solomon before coming to a sudden conclusion. And what it takes from the Solomonic history is the reminder that God \u2018does not dwell in houses made with human hands\u2019. Davies reads the speech as insisting that Israel has been too transfixed with historical and earthly securities, with the Temple and Jerusalem. Instead \u2018the extra territorial dimension of God\u2019s challenge and presence\u2019 have to be recognised.36 Jankowski, more convincingly, draws attention to the role the promise to the patriarchs plays in the speech. Despite the promise of land Stephen points out that they never settled, and their situation is that of Luke\u2019s addressees, post 70 once more forced into diaspora. The message of the speech, then, picks up the theme of the risen Christ, that the gospel must be preached \u2018to the ends of the earth\u2019. It makes the point that it is \u2018the earth freed, through the Messiah which is the promised land\u2019.37 This is not a spiritualisation, but a radicalisation, an inclusion of the entire world in the promise to Abraham. Davies recognises that the Gospel of John is not to be read through Platonising spectacles and that it has a concern for earthly realities. According to him, however, John has reached a position where Chris tology comprehensively takes the place of any concern with the land. Geography is of no fundamental interest to him, but rather \u2018the personal confrontation with the One from above, whose Spirit bloweth where it listeth and is not subject to geographical dimensions that had been dear to Judaism\u2019.38 Both in John and in Hebrews we have the emergence of a sacramental reading in which physical realities are important, but only as the means whereby the infinite God and spiritual realities are made imaginable. \u2018Such \u201csacramentalism\u201d could find holy space everywhere, but especially where Jesus had been: this sacramentalism was later on to inform the devotion to the Holy Place among many Christians throughout the ages.\u201939 This interpretation confirms what we saw in the last chapter in our reflections on sacred space. Sacramentalism, of course, is certainly not spiritualisation, but rather a way of teaching us to see the spiritual in the material. Paul appeals to Abraham, the person to whom above all the promise of the land was made. But in Davies\u2019 view \u2018Paul ignores completely the 36 Ibid., p. 272. 37 G. Jankowski, \u2018Dieses Land\u2019, in Texte undKontexte 80 4/98, p. 57 (my italics). 38 Davies, Gospel, p. 335. 39 Ibid., p. 367. territorial aspect of the promise.\u2019 \u2018In Galatians we can be fairly certain that Paul did not merely ignore the territorial aspect of the promise for political reasons: his silence points not merely to the absence of a conscious concern with it, but to his deliberate rejection of it.\u20194\u00b0 Paul universalises salvation by locating it in Christ rather than tying it to a particular land. This does not mean, however, that Paul spiritualises the promise. Rather, as Gerhard Jankowski argues, \u2018Paul does not have the land, but the whole world order before his eyes... Jews and non Jews together, as descendants of Abraham, inherit the world order.\u201941 Paul does indeed have a political perspective, but it is not the autonomy of Israel in \u2018their own\u2019 land, but the freedom of all people in the whole earth. Davies concludes his discussion as follows: The witness of the New Testament is... twofold: it transcends the land... Yes: but its History and Theology demand a concern with these realities also. Is there a reconciling principle behind these apparently contradictory attitudes? There is... The New Testament... personalizes \u2018holy space\u2019 in Christ, who, as a figure of History, is rooted in the land... but, as Living Lord... is also free to move wherever he wills.42 The attitude of the New Testament to the land can therefore, according to Davies, be summed up in the themes of rejection, spiritualisation, historical concern and sacramental concentration. This is a straightforward statement of the attitude of the great tradition in Christian theology towards tire question of land. But Jankowski suggests what I believe is a more accurate way of putting it, namely that in the New Testament we have a universalisation of the promise, and of a concern with land which moves beyond Palestine to \u2018the whole inhabited earth\u2019 of Pentecost. That this is the case can be argued from the famous passage from the Epistle toDiognetus, which dates probably from the end of the first century: For Christians are distinguished from the rest of men neither by country nor by language nor by customs. For nowhere do they dwell in cities of their own; they do not use any strange form of speech... But while they dwell in both Greek and barbarian cities, each as his lot was cast, and follow the customs of the land in dress and food and other matters of living, they shew forth the remarkable and admittedly strange order of their own citizenship. They live in fatherlands of their own, but as aliens. They share all things as citizens, and suffer all things as strangers. Every foreign land is their fatherland, and every fatherland a foreign land... They pass their days on earth, but they have their citizenship in heaven.43 1 1 Ibid., pp. 178\u20149 41 Jankowski, \u2018Dieses Land\u2019, p. 55. 42 Davies, Gospel, p. 367. 43 Tr. from H. G. Meecham, The Epistle of Diognetus (Manchester: Manchester University Press, A more radical relativisation of attachment to land and place is hard to imagine, but this is not the same as spiritualisation. This can be seen by comparing it with the attitude of the marginal groups Leonie Sandercock finds operating on what she calls \u2018the borderlands\u2019. These groups, she says, \u2018redefine \u201chome\u201d as a state of being in the world, rather than standing in one place, murmuring about our roots\u2019. Home is the struggle for communities of resistance. And home is that place, wherever, which encourages varied and ever changing perspectives, a place where one discovers new ways of seeing reality. They describe a new consciousness, a consciousness of the borderlands, shaped by cultural collision, forged out of emotional states of perplexity and confusion, open to \u2018foreign\u2019 ways of seeing and thinking.1 This is actually not at all a bad way of describing the post resurrection community. Also in favour of a less spiritualised reading of the New Testament we can note, first, that it derives from the period of the Roman occupation of Palestine, and deliberately distances itself from the Zealot struggle for freedom, which was judged to be either impractical or insufficiently radical. \u2018Land\u2019 in this period might spell \u2018chauvinist struggle\u2019, which can never be liberating. Secondly, Paul is a city dweller, a citizen of the empire, moving freely round the whole of the Mediterranean, and this is his remit, ft is this in part which accounts for the universalisation of the promise of which we have already spoken. Thirdly, Davies, like so many New Testament scholars, fails to see that the New Testament presupposes the Old at every point. So we cannot read the Beatitudes, or Jesus\u2019 parables, or his first sermon at Nazareth, without the Jubilee year or Deuteronomic theologies of the land in mind. Davies\u2019 reading is driven by the assumption that the New Testament is only continuing what was the trend in important strands of inter testamental Judaism, but in some respects Jesus was clearly appealing back past that to \u2018scripture\u2019. Furthermore, as Brueggemann points out, the theme of kingdom, which is the heart of Jesus\u2019 proclamation, includes among its nuances the idea of a historical, political, physical realm, i.e. land, and Jesus tells his followers to pray for this to come \u2018on earth\u2019. Brueggemann finds a continuance in the Jesus movement of the theology he finds in Torah, namely that the way to land is by loss, whilst the way to lose land is to grasp it. Similarly in Paul, the law and gospel theme can be understood in terms of grasping land and receiving it freely. \u2018The assertions of Paul are about 1 Sandercock, Towards Cosmopolis, p. 120 (my italics). living faithfully in history, about being secure in a world which promises no security, about having a place in a displacing world.\u20191 To argue, then, that land is or is not a New Testament concern, literally or spiritually, misses the point. \u2018It is rather the history of a gift and grasp which concerns the church. It is a radical affirmation in the New Testament, based on the Hebrew bible, that to grasp is to lose, whilst to risk is to be given.\u20192 There is no doubt that, as Brueggemann puts it, \u2018[SJpiritual Christianity, by refusing to face the land question, has served to sanction existing inequities\u2019.3 Richard Sennett makes essentially the same point in his claim that Christianity drove a wedge between inner and outer, thereby disenfranchising us from the city. These attitudes cannot appeal to the Christian Scriptures as a whole where \u2018the voice of the dispossessed\u2019 demands a share of the land. That other parts of the Christian tradition have understood this becomes obvious when we turn to the questions of possession and identity. POSSESSION The theology of common ownership \u2018In the beginning of Time\u2019, wrote Gerrard Winstanley, in his great manifesto of 1649, \u2018the great Creator Reason, made the earth to be a Common Treasury, to preserve Beasts, Birds, Fishes and Man... not one word was spoken in the beginning that one branch of mankind should rule over another. \u20194 The recreation of the situation of the book of Judges was his goal. There can be no freedom, he wrote, \u2018unless the Land of England be freely set at liberty from proprietors, and become a common Treasury to all her children, as every portion of the Land of Canaan was the common livelihood of such and such a Tribe, and of every member in that Tribe, without exception, neither hedging in any, nor hedging out\u2019.5 That the land was originally held in common was taken for granted by nineteenth century anthropology.6 Today we are more discriminating. 1 Brueggemann, The Land, p. 178. 2 Ibid., p. 183. 3 Ibid., p. 193. 2 48 Winstanley, \u2018The Levellers Standard Advanced\u2019, in Selected Writings, p. 10. 3 49 Winstanley, \u2018A Declaration...\u2019, in Selected Writings, p. 31. 4 50 So, for example, Sir George Campbell in J. W. Probyn (ed.), Systems of Land Tenure in Various Countries (London: Cassell, Petter &amp; Galpin, 1881), p. 215: \u2018We are too apt to forget that property in land, as a transferable mercantile commodity absolutely owned and passing from hand to 5 hand like any chattel, is not an ancient institution, but a modern development, reached only in a very few advanced[!] countries. In the greater part of the world the right of cultivating 6 particular portions of the earth is rather a privilege than a property; a privilege first of a whole people, then of a particular tribe or a particular village community, and, finally, of particular Many societies were organised in this way, Marion Shoard affirms, but not all. The Ojibwa Indians in Canada, for example, were organised on a \u2018fiercely individual basis\u2019 and land was parcelled out on the assumption of absolute ownership. Trespassers were not just prosecuted but shot. In fact, in relation to land, a huge variety of possibilities have been tried, but one thing seems certain, and that is that sooner or later inequitable systems of land ownership are challenged.51 The idea of the Great Society that \u2018[a] 11 things under heaven ought to be common\u2019 has functioned as \u2018a memory which could be used as an aspiration\u2019.52 Political theorists have wrestled with the question since at least the time of Plato, who believed the Guardians should have all things in common, and recognised the divisiveness of private property.53 Aristotle reviewed three possibilities: that land might be privately owned, but the produce stored for common consumption; that ownership and cultivation should be common but the produce parcelled out for private use; and that land and its produce should be held in common. The first was his preferred option. He noted that some partiality for such things as oneself, one\u2019s property, and so forth is almost universal. But property cannot be a goal in life. As far as he is concerned the only property which is necessary \u2018is such as is necessary for life, capable of being stored, and useful for the community of the household and city\u2019.54 Stoic arguments about self sufficiency, and about all sharing in the rights of creation, were particularly important for the early Church Fathers. Here is John Chrysostom on property: Mark the wise dispensation of God! That he might put mankind to shame, he has made certain things common, as the sun, air, earth and water... whose benefits are dispensed equally to all as brethren... observe that concerning things that are common there is no contention, but all is peaceable. But when one attempts to possess himself of anything... then contention is introduced, as if nature herself were indignant, that when God brings us together in every way, we are eager to divide and separate ourselves by appropriating things, and individuals of the community. In this last stage the land is partitioned off to these individuals as a matter of mutual convenience, but not in unconditional property; it long remains subject to certain conditions and to reversionary interests of the community, which prevent its uncontrolled alienation, and attach to it certain common rights and burdens. Cf. the Belgian anthropologist Emile de Laveleye: \u201cIn all primitive societies, the soil was the joint property of the tribes and was subject to periodical distribution among all the families, so that all might live by their labour as nature has ordained. The comfort of each was thus proportioned to his energy and intelligence; no one, at any rate, was destitute of the means of subsistence, and inequality increasing from generation to generation was provided against.\u201d\u2019 Cited in H. George, Progress and Poverty ( London: Dent, 1911), p. 370. 51 Shoard, This Land, p. 3. 52 Williams, Country, pp. 42 3. 53 Plato, Republic, Book V 54 Aristotle Politics, !256b2g 30. by using those cold words \u2018mine\u2019 and \u2018thine\u2019. Then there is contention and uneasiness. But where this is not, no strife or contention is bred.55 Signally anticipating Marx\u2019s view that accumulation was usually through violence and fraud, Basil of Caesarea writes: \u2018Whom do I injure\u2019 [the rich person] says, \u2018when I retain and conserve my own?\u2019 Which things, tell me, are yours? Whence have you brought them into being? You are like one occupying a place in a theatre, who should prohibit others from entering, treating that as one\u2019s own which was designed for the common use of all. Such are the rich. Because they were the first to occupy common goods, they take these goods as their own. If each one would take that which is sufficient for one\u2019s needs, leaving what is in excess to those in distress, no one would be rich, no one poor.56 This tradition, says Charles Avila, has remained the well kept secret of the very Churches that have revered [the Church Fathers] as saints... Nothing, in fact, couldbemore striking than the extent to which the Roman law theory and practice of ownership, which the fathers attacked and sought to replace, has retained the ascendancy all through the Christian centuries that have elapsed since their thundering critical voices fell silent.57 In fact the tradition of common ownership never did fall entirely silent. The Great Society appealed to it in the middle ages, as Williams reminds us. The Diggers took up the theme in the seventeenth century. According to Winstanley: All the Prophecies, Visions, and Revelations of Scriptures, of Prophets, and Apostles... doth all seat themselves in this work of making the earth a Common Treasury.\u201958 The right to share the land on a communal basis was implied in the creation narratives in Genesis, according to him. He looked forward to a new order: But when the earth becomes a common treasury as it was in the beginning, and the king of Righteousness comes to rule in every ones heart, then he kills the first Adam; for covetousnesse thereby is killed. A man shall have meat, and drinke and clothes by his labour in freedom, and what can be desired more in earth. Pride and envy likewise is killed thereby, for every one shall look upon each other as equall in the Creation; every man indeed being a perfect Creation of himself.59 55 Homily XII on I Timothy 4, NPNF, ed. P. Schaff 26 vols. (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1886), vol. XII. 5 6 Text in G. Avila, Ownership: Early Christian Teaching (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1983), p. 49. 57 Ibid., p. 11. 58 G.

Bradstock, Faith in the Revolution: The Political Theologies of Muntzpr and Winstanley (London: SPCK, 1997), p. 99. For him communal ownership and the resurrection of Christ were interchangeable concepts: [W]hen he hath spread himself abroad amongst his Sons and daughters, the members of his mystical body, then this community of love and righteousness, making all to use the blessings of the earth as a common Treasurie amongst them, shall break forth again in his glory, and fill the earth, and shal be no more supprest: And none shal say, this is mine, but every one shal preserve each other in love.60 These ideas re appeared in secular form in the following two centuries in the writings of Rousseau and Proudhon, and Henry George made of them a whole programme, appealing explicitly to a theology of creation: If we are all here by the equal permission of the Creator, we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty with an equal right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human being as he enters the world, and which during his continuance in the world, can be limited only by the equal right of others. There is on earth no power which can rightfully make grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those who follow them. For what are we but tenants for a day?... The masses of men, who in the midst of abundance suffer want; who, clothed with political freedom, are condemned to the wages of slavery... instinctively feel that \u2018there is something wrong\u2019. And they are right.61 Common ownership of land was what he proposed as a remedy, a proposal taken up by the early British Labour Party, which wanted the nationalisation of land. That proposal was quietly dropped, and even the 1945 Labour government did not moot it. The challenge posed by such a theology is, however, far from a dead letter. It re emerged in late twentieth century Scotland, when Alister McIntosh challenged the Scottish Landowners\u2019 association on exactly the same set of principles. McIntosh appealed to the fact that in Scottish law God remains the absolute sovereign. He therefore appealed to Leviticus 25:23 \u2014 \u2018The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine.\u2019 Like George, he proposes a land tax which would bring down capital values and generate revenue. These funds would then be used to restore the land to the community as has already happened on the Isle of Eigg.62 James Robertson is one of a number of economists who favour re pristinating George\u2019s proposals, advocating site value taxation as \u2018the most neutral and most efficient of all taxes, inducing no distortions and generating no loss of welfare\u2019.\u00ae3 60 Ibid., p. 117. 61 George, Progress and Poverty, p. 24.1. 62 Guardian, 6.8.98. 63 J. Robertson, transforming licommk life, (Totnes: Green Books, 1998), p. 44. The right to private property As we have seen, according to a number of the scriptural ideologies tribal Israel had a \u2018stakeholder economy\u2019 in which every family was assured of approximately equal access to resources by organisation into extended families, clans and tribes. All but the royal ideology were designed to see that land could not be cornered and become the possession of the few. But of course this is exactly what did happen. Isaiah of Jerusalem curses \u2018those who covet fields and seize them, houses and take them\u2019 (Isa. 5.8; cf. Mic. 2.2). The king came to be the biggest land owner his estates managed by stewards (1 Chron. 27125 3:) and worked by slaves or a levy (1 Sam. 8.12). The wealthy looked for \u2018investment opportunities\u2019 which slowly but surely encroached on tribal institutions and ways of life. By the eighth century, as we know from prophetic protests, many formerly free Israelites had ended up as debt slaves or landless labourers.64 The story of Naboth\u2019s vineyard is the most famous example of the way in which this fundamental condition of Israel\u2019s existence could be set aside. Ahab wanted to rationalise his property to take over Naboth\u2019s land, which adjoined his palace, and re locate him \u2014give him another vineyard somewhere else. But Naboth refused: \u2018I will not give you my ancestral inheritance (i whalah ).\u2019 His wife Jezebel was Sidonian, and used to kings getting their own way. She promptly had Naboth murdered, and presented Ahab with the vineyard. At this point Elijah, representative of the old traditions of Israel, intervenes: Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, Go down to meet King Ahab... You shall say to him, \u2018Thus says the Lord: Have you killed, and also taken possession?... In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\u2019 (1 Kgs 21.17 19) Walter Brueggemann again attempts to understand the question raised here in terms of a theology of grace. He argues that there is a pattern throughout this history, namely that \u2018gifted land gives life but managed land does not\u2019.\u00ae5 The regulations of the Torah are there, he argues, to protect Israel\u2019s understanding of the land as gifted, and to protect the poor. Many states illustrate the pattern of Israel\u2019s history, beginning with a stakeholder economy, and ending up with a huge gulf between rich and poor. Rome seems to have begun with the allocation of small and approximately equal lots, and the patrician class emerged through primitive accumulation. When Roman law was formulated, much later, it 64 Following N. Gottwald, The Hebrew Bible: A Socio Literary Introduction (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1985), p. 324. 65 Brueggemann, The Land, p. 35. accorded absolute rights of ownership, dominium, \u2018to have, to hold, to use, to enjoy, to do as one pleases\u2019. The rediscovery of Roman law in Padua in the tenth century led to the adoption of this idea of ownership in much of Europe. In England free ceorls seem to have constituted the majority of land holders in the early Saxon period, but following that there was a steady regression. According to the feudal law of the eleventh century ownership was still not absolute. The King was only lord paramount of every acre, and the royal demesne, the term regis, always remained the treasure of the realm.1 Feudal landright was local, varying according to the custom of the manor. With the transfer of power to the King in Parliament, and the establishment of statute law, \u2018landownership passed from an empirical order of things to a realm of permanent definition\u2019 and as this happened \u2018doctrine hardened against the villeins\u2019. The median of the Middle Ages was the darkest hour for servile tenants. The thirteenth century had settled the law: all villein property, land and goods, is held nomine alieno it is the lord\u2019s. About this doctrine was woven an ever increasing restrictive practice. A villein had no right to dispose of his goods or land save as the lord should let him. Force of circumstance mitigated the rule... but the harsh doctrine was logically pursued in many other directions.2 The rise of the middle class in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries led to that change in the approach to property which Sir George Campbell noted, according to which property in land became \u2018a transferable mercantile commodity absolutely owned and passing from hand to hand like any chattel\u2019. Various ideologies arose to meet the new situation, the most important of which was Locke\u2019s idea that it is the work which we put into land which makes it ours, and Hegel\u2019s view that we can only find self realisation through property: \u2018If emphasis is placed on my needs, then the possession of property appears as a means to their satisfaction, but the true position is that, from the standpoint of freedom, property is the first embodiment of freedom, and so is in itself a substantive end.\u20193 In fact, as M. Longfield noted briskly in 1881, these justifications are specious. Ownership in land and labour cannot be compared, he argues, because \u2018land is the gift of the Creator of the world to mankind\u2019. \u2018Every argument 1 D. R. Denman, Origins of Ownership (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1958), p. 80. Homage is what is distinctively characteristic of feudalism. \u2018Feudum5, at the Norman conquest, \u2018denotes the concrete, tangible lands of a feudal tenant and the abstract idea of an interest held of a superior in exchange for services rendered.5 2 Ibid., p. 121. 3 G. W. F. Hegel, Philosophy of Right (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 42. used to give an ethical foundation for the exclusive right of property in land has a latent fallacy. It omits a portion of the value which ought not to be left out of consideration.\u2019 The foundation of the right to property in land is not ethical, but political. Its origin is expediency. In order that it may be cultivated to the most advantage, it is necessary that the cultivator should be secured in the enjoyment of the fruits of his intended industry. For this purpose it is necessary that the person who is permitted to use the land should be permitted to enjoy it for a certain length of time, to make it his interest to cultivate it in the most productive manner. This period varies with the increase of foresight and agricultural knowledge.1 Again, it is only convenience which leads to the permission of absolute ownership, \u2018subject to such taxes and regulations as the State shall from time to time think it reasonable to impose\u2019. A little earlier Marx pointed out that \u2018 [a]n isolated individual could no more have property in land and soil than he could speak\u2019. He could, of course, live off it as substance, as do the animals. The relation to the earth as property is always mediated through the occupation of the land and soil... by the tribe, the commune, (or some other social formation) in some more or less naturally arisen or already historically developed form. The individual can never appear here in the dot like isolation in which he appears as mere free worker.2 What Marx looked to was \u2018individual property based on the acquisitions of the Capital era: i.e. on cooperation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production\u2019.3' What we have at present, however, is the absolutisation of the \u2018right to property\u2019. Samuel Whitbread told Marion Shoard in 1982: Possession is nine tenths of the law. I am in possession here. I control what I have got here. In fact, in my case it happens to be 11,000 acres of farmland, and forestry, and in your case, if I may say so, it may be a flat in South London. The actual ethics of possession are the same. I think one should be at liberty to do what one likes with one\u2019s own.4 Of course \u2018the ethics of possession\u2019 are not the same at all. In Marion Shoard\u2019s case it is that of one among millions of stakeholders. This property is very rarely a source of wealth, and not often inherited over generations. In Whitbread\u2019s it is that of a tiny number who, usually by 1 M. Longfield, \u2018Land Tenure in Ireland\u2019, in Probyn, Systems, p. 71. 2 Marx, Grundrisse, ed. D. McClellan (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973), p. 491. 3 K. Marx, Capital (Moscow: Progress, 1954), vol. 1 p. 715. 4 Shoard, This Land, p. 394. inheritance but sometimes by the amassing of large fortunes, have cornered the bulk of the land and use it for their own pleasure, profit and advantage. It is this use, or abuse, of the land which is the real ethical problem in the light of what Torah has to say. IDENTITY The command against amassing land is clear enough, but this does not settle the issue. For on the one hand, land is one of the major foci of inequity and injustice on many levels, but on the other human beings seem to need attachments to places roots to thrive. This has traditionally been a theme of right wing thinkers, as it is today in the debates about the Common European currency, but, as David Harvey has signally demonstrated, it is equally a concern of the left in the attempt to find a space of protection from rootless capital. \u2018We are plants which, whether we like it or not \u2014 must with our roots rise out of the earth in order to bloom in the ether and bear fruit.\u20191 This is Heidegger, who earlier cast a deep shadow on his ideas of land and place by his enthusiastic support for the Nazi party. But place is also central, for example, to Raymond Williams\u2019 novels, and a theme he turns to elsewhere. \u2018A new theory of socialism\u2019, he wrote,4 must now centrally involve place.^ Remember the argument was that the proletariat had no country, the factor which differentiated it from the property owning classes. But place has been shown to be a crucial element in the bonding process more so perhaps for the working class than the capital owning classes by the explosion of the international economy and the destructive effects of deindustrialization upon old communities. When capital has moved on, the importance of place is more clearly revealed.2 Like spaces, places are constructed, a product, of institutionalised social, political and economic power. \u2018The creation of symbolic places\u2019, says Harvey, is not given in the stars but painstakingly nurtured and fought over precisely because of the hold that place can have over the imaginary... If places are the locus of collective memory, then social identity and the capacity to mobilize that identity into configurations of political solidarity are highly dependent upon 1 M. Heidegger, Discourse on Thinking (New York: Harper &amp; Row) 1966 pp. 47 8, cited in Harvey, Justice, p. 301. 2 R Williams, Resources of Hope (London: Verso, 1989), p. 242. The same is true for groups like the Palestinians. Yasser Arafat argues that their deepest need is identity, and that that requires land. processes of place construction and sustenance... Materiality, representation and imagination are not separate worlds.1 The vision of the unity of the world wide proletariat, now replaced in some feminist rhetoric by that of a world wide solidarity between women, drew on earlier visions of universal brotherhood, Christian and Muslim, instantiated by the earlier quotation from the Epistle to Diognetus. It has an obvious significance in a world of ethnic cleansing and of the mass movement of refugees and \u2018ethnic minorities\u2019. On the other hand, the significance of attachment to place cannot be denied, and its significance finds powerful biblical expression. In an article written in 1933, the year the Nazis came to power in Germany, von Rad reflected on \u2018rest\u2019 in the Old Testament. \u2018Rest\u2019 is about security. Thus the narrative of Joshua concludes with it: \u2018Thus the Lord gave to Israel all the land that he swore to their ancestors that he would give them; and having taken possession of it, they settled there. And the Lord gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their ancestors\u2019Qosh. 21.43 4). \u2018Rest\u2019 and possession of the land are bound up with each other. As von Rad puts it: It is emphasised that redemption is a present reality and that all Israel is the chosen people; and it is evident that this notion of the land which Israel is to inhabit... is a theological concept of the highest order... We must not spiritualise any of this: this \u2018rest\u2019 is not peace of mind, but the altogether tangible peace granted to a nation plagued by enemies and weary of wandering. It is altogether a direct gift from the hand of God !2 This is well said, and it highlights the importance of the possession. On the one hand it is clear that we must not lose ourselves in abstraction, and retreat into merely spiritual realities. People need security and the opportunity to put down roots to flourish. That flourishing is evidenced by the emergence of thousands of different cultures world wide, with their own languages, cuisines, arts, religions and ways of doing things. Such diversity is unthinkable without \u2018rest\u2019 and possession. \u2018It is land that fully permits Israel to be Israel,\u2019 says Brueggemann. \u2018It is land that fully permits Yahweh to be known as Yahweh. It is land that permits Yahweh and Israel to have history together.\u20193 The loss of the land means \u2018the collapse of all public institutions and all symbolic expressions of well being and coherence\u2019.78 The \u2018all\u2019 here is too strong. Jeremiah, whom 77 Brueggemann, The Land, p. 142. 1 Harvey, Justice, p. 322. From a rather different perspective Harries argues that it is the function of buildings to turn space into place. K. Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), pp. 154, 213. 2 Von Rad, Hexateueh, p. 95 (my italics). 3 78 Ibid., p. 114. Brueggemann calls \u2018the poet of the land par excellence\u2019, is also the poet of the exile and refugee and urges his compatriots to settle down in Babylon, \u2018build houses and dwell in them\u2019, and work for the good of their conquerors (Jer. 29). Even without land, some expressions of well being and coherence remained. YHWH was \u2018with\u2019 Israel for two thousand years of its history, as it found itself \u2018scattered amongst the nations\u2019. \u2018Place\u2019 remained in the promise, rehearsed each year at Passover, in the sabbath meal, and in the local synagogue community. The same might be said of the mosque for today\u2019s European Muslims. The dissolution of place, Harvey suggests, amounts to a loss of identity. \u2018It suggests a fundamental spiritual alienation from environment and self that demands remedial measures.\u20191 The history of Israel from Abraham suggests that that is only very partially true. The ideologies in both Joshua and in Deuteronomy emphasise that Canaan is gift. Israel inherits cities, cisterns, vineyards and olive trees which it did not build, hew or plant. For Brueggemann this implies a theology of radical grace, but this is hardly how it can have seemed to those who built the cities, dug the cisterns and established the vineyards which were occupied. Since the biblical promises are regularly invoked by the religious right in Israel, with the results for the Palestinians of which we are all aware, it does not seem possible to characterise these passages solely in terms of \u2018grace\u2019. W. D. Davies is perhaps nearer the mark in finding evidence of a bad conscience which Israel then has to justify. He cites, for example, a very late text, 1 Maccabees 15:33, in which Israel seems to protest too much: \u2018We have neither taken other men\u2019s lands, nor have we possession of that which appertains to others, but of the inheritance of our fathers.\u2019 It is the promise, the \u2018inheritance of our fathers\u2019, which is used here to justify the occupation. Hence the repeated refrain, \u2018the land which I promised.. Israel has to convince itself of the legitimacy of the original act of dispossession through which it came into the land. According to this ideology conquest and grace are one and the same thing. This makes it impossible to read the story of the land purely in terms of grace, for the twin ideologies of the chosen people and the promised land, appropriated by various \u2018peoples of the book\u2019, have been some of the most noxious in human history, as we can see from the effects in North America, South Africa and the Balkans. Historically, promised land for some has always meant dispossession and death for others. Dispossessed themselves, by Rome, Jews were harried amongst the nations, forced into ghettoes, the victims of pogroms, for nearly two 1 Harvey, Justice, p. 308. thousand years. The Holocaust was the culmination of this whole process. But with the land restored again another people is dispossessed, and Israel has the land at the cost of constant wars and the non stop threat of terror, quite apart from what conquest and aggression do to one\u2019s own culture. The ambiguities of possession and place seem to be inescapable. The need for settled place is also raised by the operations of global capital, able to move its plant at will, and frequently leaving whole economies and large workforces high and dry. \u2018The bourgeoisie\u2019, said Marx and Engels in a famous passage in the Communist Manifesto, \u2018historically, has played a most revolutionary part\u2019: [ W] herever it has got the upper hand [it] has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations... All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind. This applies also to land, as they go on to note, in the destruction of national industries and the globalisation of industry. International capital changes our understanding of place, as David Harvey argues, through uneven capital investment, the geographical division of labour, the compression of space time relations which abolish the frictions of distance, and setting places in competition with each other in an attempt to lure capital investment. \u2018The cathedral city becomes a heritage centre, the mining community becomes a ghost town, the old industrial centre is deindustrialized, speculative boom towns or gentrified neighbourhoods arise on the frontiers of capitalist development or out of the ashes of deindustrialized communities. The history of capitalism is... punctuated by intense phases of spatial reorganization.\u20191 1 Ibid., p. 296. 81 Cited in ibid., p. 302. and went through all the rigmaroles of legal purchase to prove the point (Jer. 32). But he did not imagine that the people of Israel would be without God in Babylon either, and announced as a \u2018word from the Lord\u2019 that the exiles should work for the good of the city. What this suggests, as does the New Testament idea of the universalisation of the promise, and the Epistle to Diognetus\u2019 insistence that \u2018every foreign land is a father land\u2019, is that place is not an absolute but a relative good. Rootedness is essential for the flourishing of difference, and the world would be a very boring place without it. On these grounds the cultural imperialism of McDonalds, Coca Cola and the rest needs to be resisted whenever possible. But the need to cater for very large numbers of refugees, caused now not just by wars and economic displacement but by climate change, is likewise an absolute priority. Local identities have never been static, in any case, and large influxes of refugees simply mean a speeding up of the pace of change for a while in the course of which the understanding of place will change. Whether or not this is for the good can be decided by all that happens to the arts of human flourishing. At the same time the emergence of what Webber called the \u2018non place urban realm\u2019, where high mobility leads to the dissolution of localised senses of community and their replacement with more functional communities, needs to be resisted.1 Somehow we need to create for ourselves both open place, at the same time as open place. Trinitarian ethics and the stewardship of land 1 M. M. Webber, \u2018The urban place and the non place urban realm\u2019, in Explorations into Urban Stucture (Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1964). 2 Shoard, This Land, p. 483. 3 As noted at the start of the chapter, Norway, which never had feudalism, is a case in point. Far from having trespass laws, it has the right to roam enshrined in its constitution. stakeholding. The two imply each other: a roughly equal allocation is the practical outworking of gift to \u2018Adam\u2019. What would this mean, however, to a post industrial society in which increasing numbers live in mega cities? What would it mean, concretely, to honour the scriptural injunctions about land as gift and land as nahalah ? How could these principles be enshrined in law, and written into the social fabric so that they made a real difference to the lives of the vast majority of ordinary people? Are they condemned to be a dead letter? What steps need to be taken to alter the barbarous disproportion of ownership which prevails? David Harvey properly insists on the impossibility of beginning with a tabula rasa, on the need to work within the limits of the possible.1 Small steps towards change might, then, include the following. In the first place law needs to be altered to make clear that possession can never be absolute, in the sense that Whitbread and his fellow land owners think it is. There is indeed a place for stewardship, another argument often advanced by the land owning classes, but stewardship is on behalf of all. Adamah comes first. We are debtors to all, as Muir rightly said. There may well be a case, as the Indian constitution believed in 1947, for setting a ceiling on ownership, but in principle there is nothing wrong with some disparity so long as it is not a warrant for exclusion and abuse of power as it currently is. In the late middle ages, comments Marion Shoard, land owners accepted that they must share their rights over their land with the rest of the community. \u2018That principle was forgotten in the eighteenth century. Now we need to return to it.\u20192 She advocates the extension of town planning legislation to the whole countryside as a way of giving the community a say in the fate of the land. This raises the question of the democratic deficit, for land use is under constant discussion, but in a situation where the rich and powerful, and especially the Corporations, can sway politicians and planning authorities as the poor cannot. Put theologically, setting limits to absolute possession, and bringing it under proper democratic control, is a political realisation of belief in God as Creator, as Winstanley, John Ball and the Great Society clearly saw. Secondly, if we seriously accept that land is gift this has implications for access to land and land use. Enjoyment of rural beauty long antedates the industrial revolution, but escape or retreat to \u2018the countryside\u2019 is now a major source of enjoyment for huge numbers of people: 20 million \u2014 a third of the population \u2014 were engaged in leisure cycling in Britain 1 D. Harvey, Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. 2o6ff. 2 Shoard, This Land, p. 432. in 1995, and 18 million people head for the countryside on summer Sundays! Because adamah comes first, access has to be understood as a right, rather than be criminalised, as it was in Britain in 1994. At the same time, agricultural land, \u2018the countryside\u2019, cannot be construed exclusively or even primarily in terms of leisure, as a resource for the towns. Following the Foot and Mouth epidemic in Britain in 2001 the old \u2018Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food\u2019 has been abandoned and replaced by a \u2018Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\u2019. This move follows a series of crises, including a \u2018crisis of overproduction\u2019 within Europe, but is also a recognition of the fact that tourism is now far more lucrative than farming. That fact represents both the growth in leisure and disposable income for a large section of society, but also the assumption, constantly proclaimed by European politicians, that \u2018the issue of food security is a thing of the past\u2019. Memories are short, and it is imperative to heed the warnings of the Worldwatch Institute that feeding 8 billion, or whatever the plateau figure of the earth\u2019s population turns out to be, will not be easy, and in any event cannot be done at present Northern levels.1 Land use, at least in Britain, has often been irresponsible in this respect. The larger and more centralised the housing system, argues John Turner, the more wasteful the use of land. Alice Coleman\u2019s land use surveys show that huge areas of farming land have been needlessly built over, often in the interests of the public housing estate.2 I return to this issue in chapter 9. Theologically, the question of land use is an expression of God the Redeemer, who seeks and commands fullness of life for all people. Thirdly, we live in a world where the majority are effectively excluded from their nahalah. These people, the homeless and the refugee, those who live in wretched apartments and flats in sink estates, are owed their own stake in the land as of right, in virtue of the solidarity they share with the rest of us. What is lamely called \u2018re housing\u2019 is an imperative of what Paul calls the law of grace. Theologically, this is a political realisation of God the Reconciler, who seeks justice for the oppressed and commands hospitality for the refugee. It raises the question of housing for six or eight billion, and it is to this question I now turn. 1 A. T. Durning, How Much is Enough? (London: Earthscan, 1992), pp. 65ft 2 J. E C.Turner, \u2018Issues in Self Help and SelfManaged Housing\u2019, in P. Ward (ed.), Self Help Housing: A Critique (London: Mansell, 1982), p. 108. Mark Shucksmith, on the other hand, believes that the prevention of rural housing since World War II in Britain has been socially regressive and socially exclusive: Housebuilding in Britain\u2019s Countryside (London: Routledge, 1990), p. 202. He is not, however, in favour of carte blanche. The human dwelling Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. (Jeremiah 29.5) The house comes before the city: as the most vulnerable of mammals human beings need shelter. Even the homeless must find shelter somehow, in doorways, in cardboard cities, in subways. And from the earliest period human beings have turned raw shelter into something else, something richer, so that the built environment has become perhaps the most important lived dimension of art and culture. As Lewis Mumford reminds us, human beings were symbol making animals before they were tool making animals, and reached specialisation in myth, religion and ritual before they did in material aspects of culture.1 These ideological factors found expression especially in the dwelling. Amos Rapoport in particular has shown that house design cannot be understood just as a response to climate and local building potentials. These have their place, but they do not seem to be decisive. Rapoport found \u2018extreme\u2019 differences in urban pattern and house types within quite small geographical areas, which he argued showed that culture is much more decisive a factor in building than climate.2 His conclusion is that \u2018Nonutilitarian factors seem of primary importance\u2019 in the construction of ordinary dwellings. These include religious beliefs, family and clan structure, and social organisation.3 Today we are used to the idea of Feng shui and Sthapatya veda, which discern different spiritual 1 L. Mumford, Artand Technics (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952), quoted in A. Rapoport, House, Form and Culture (NewJersey: Prentice Hall, 1969), p. 42. 2 For example, the ancient Egyptians knew the vault but rarely used it because it was at odds with their image or idea of building In prehistoric Crete the tightly clustered settlements must be attributed to the gregarious instincts of the people rather than to defence. In seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe fashions for building in wood or stone overrode the convenience of local materials. Rapoport, House, pp. 25, 31. 3 Ibid., pp. 41, 47. energies in different parts of the house and claim to improve health and rest.4 At the other end of the scale Palladio, writing during the Renaissance, gave the ordering of the house an explicitly theological rationale. Buildings, he says, should appear like a well finished body. \u2018Our blessed Creator has ordered the parts of our body, so that the most beautiful should be in places which are exposed to sight, and the less decent in hidden places.\u20195 By the less decent he meant kitchens. We can disagree with his Christology and argue that on the proper understanding of the gospels the kitchen should have pride of place, but the theologico architectural principle is absolutely sound. The symbolic function of the house continues into modern times. Papworth, writing during the Regency, attributed to the Englishman\u2019s character the desire to \u2018congregate about him in his dwelling and domain all the means of domestic comfort... and there lay up his chief resources against the cares of life\u2019, so that his home was not so much a castle as \u2018the depository of his most interesting pleasures, the anticipated enjoyment of which gives energy to his mind and cheers his exertion towards the accomplishment of his undertakings\u2019.6 In truth this seems not to be an English, but a middle class, characteristic. Certainly these remarks are true of middle class America where a study found the word \u2018house\u2019 had nine meanings, including relationships with others, social networks, statement of self identity, a place of privacy, a locus of everyday behaviour and base of activity, a childhood home and a place of upbringing and shelter and physical structure.7 Rather on the lines which Papworth indicates, North American developers never build houses but \u2018homes\u2019, a word which, as John Steinbeck observed, reduces Americans to tears. And yet this is far more dream than reality. \u2018The dream home is surrounded by trees and grass in either country or suburb, and must be owned, yet Americans rarely stay in it more than five years. It is not a real need but a symbol.\u20198 Some have argued that the idea of\u2018home\u2019 only developed with the growth of demands for comfort and privacy after the 4 For Sthapatya veda see Kathleen Cox, Vaski Living: Creating a Home for the Soul (New York: Marlowe &amp; Go., 2000). Victor Papanek speaks of architecture, including the buildings of Christopher Day, which \u2018awakens our innermost mythic responses\u2019. The Green Imperative (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 99 He is, as we shall see, an advocate of some form of vernacular architecture. He is also of the view that in large parts of the Far East the importance of Feng shui and the whole cosmological approach to architecture \u2018can hardly be overstated\u2019 (p. 131). 5 A.

Rybczynski, Home (London: Heinemann, 1988); D. Hayward, \u2018Home as an environmental and psychological concept\u2019, Landscape 20 (1975), pp 2\u20149. This seems to me doubtful in the light of what we learn in ancient literature. The Odyssey, for example, is really a huge poem about homecoming, where \u2018home\u2019 is both the \u2018high roofed house\u2019, flocks and herds, Ithaca, but also the loyal wife, and a marital bed carved out of an olive tree. Caught with Calypso, Odysseus still sits day by day on a promontory and weeps for home. Homer even includes that corniest of Hollywood clich\u00e9s, the faithful hound, and does what no Hollywood director would dare do, has the dog die the moment his master returns home and he has recognised him. Recall also Leonie Sandercock\u2019s account of home discussed in the previous chapter, where \u2018home\u2019 is the struggle for communities of resistance, that place, wherever, where one discovers new ways of seeing reality. 2 Rybczynski Home, p. 24) cites Aries\u2019s argument that \u2018home\u2019 did not exist for the poor until the twentieth century, but music hall ballads seem to contradict this, at least for Britain. Interestingly, the idealisation of the cottage with roses around the door as the image of \u2018home\u2019 is found in Dickens from 1840 on. This was part of his loathing of industrialisation, but it also calls into question the idea that \u2018home\u2019 for the poor had to wait for the twentieth century, as does Miss Mitford\u2019s even earlier Our Village. 3 H. Stretton, Capitalism, Socialism and the Environment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), p.183. 4 P. Saunders, A Nation of Homeowners (London: Unwin Hyman, 1990), pp. 271 2. D. Massey, Space, Place and Gender (Cambridge: Polity, 1994), p. 166. bell hooks agrees with Sandercock. For her, \u2018home is that place which enables and promotes varied and ever changing perspectives, a place where one discovers new ways of seeing reality\u2019. Cited in ibid., p. 171. 5 *4 S. Watson and H. Austerberry, Housing and Homelessness: A Feminist Perspective London: Routledge, 1986). The process by which a house becomes a \u2018home\u2019 signifies, then, not only the difference between shelter and dwelling, but the difference between colonial and imperial experience, sometimes the difference between rich and poor. Karsten Harries has argued that the old sense of dwelling was part of a situation where place meant destiny, and that it is a good thing to be free of it.15 \u2018To be genuinely at home in this world, we have to affirm our essential homelessness... every attempt to step into the true centre, to come home in this sense... denies the essential ec centricity of human dwelling an ec centricity that needs to be thought in relation to a centre, but a centre that withdraws whenever we seek to seize it.\u201d6 On a practical level this is to some extent recognised by those who choose to live in mobile homes, which provide \u2018shelter at modest cost\u2019, though here too the trappings of permanence quickly become apparent.17 The mobile home owner could appeal to Abraham, and the notion of essential homelessness can obviously appeal both to the biblical tradition (Heb. 11.8 10) and to the Augustinian tradition of the restless heart. What we have to set it against is the logic of incarnation to which Palladio appeals. The old rootedness of place, in which \u2018home\u2019 is first and foremost village and town, rather than street and house, still survives not only in the South, but in many places in the North as well, and in both \u2018home\u2019 may apply to a particularly significant or loved house. There is a sense in which this bondage is perfect freedom, teaching one a depth of knowledge and respect for one\u2019s immediate world impossible for the footloose to obtain.18 The meanings attached to the houses we live in are important because, as Christopher Day puts it, we do not look at buildings, but rather breathe them in. Architecture can be used to manipulate, as with Nazi stadiums, intending to overawe, or shopping malls, persuading us to buy, but most of the time we do not notice buildings and then they work on us without any conscious resistance. Buildings, and especially the houses we live in, form, as Day puts it, the third human skin.'9 Houses express, and are intended to express, a moral order: Jane Austen\u2019s novels spell this out in detail, and Mansfield Park turns on it. The plan books which became popular from the third decade of the nineteenth century onwards quite explicitly distributed domestic space so as to reinforce patriarchal values: 15 K. Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), pp. 162, 168. 16 Ibid., p. 200. 17 Ibid., pp. 144, 147. ^ I shall return to this question in chapter 7. My own experience suggests that extreme mobility is far from universal and that even in the North there are still many people (one could not put a percentage on it) who lead traditionally rooted lives. C. Day, Places of the Soul (London: Thorsons (an imprint of HarperCollins), 1990), pp. 10, 42. the library for men, the parlour for women, and the dining room for the meeting of the sexes. Twentieth century domestic architecture in Europe and the United States is a mapping of changing ways of understanding family and gender relationships.20 The oldest, and still enduring, ideology of the domestic dwelling is as sacred site, and this is where we can begin a consideration of its theological significance. THE HOUSE AS SACRED SITE \u2018Even in the crudest neolithic village\u2019, says Mumford, \u2018the house was always more than mere shelter for the physical body: it was the meeting place of a household; its hearth was a centre of religious ceremony as well as an aid to cooking; it was the home of the household god and the locus of the family\u2019s being, a repository of moral values not measurable in money.\u201921 The central site of\u2018secular\u2019 life was also the site of the sacred. This is one of the themes in the great story of the three angelic visitors in Genesis 18 which, in bringing together both eager hospitality and the presence of God, identifies the practice of hospitality as a typical locus of the sacred, as do many ancient cultures. For the early Christians, confined to domestic space by Roman proscription, the house was the centre of fellowship, the site of the eucharistie celebration, and \u2018the extension of hospitality through the meal setting was the central act that served to define the worshipping community\u2019.22 For these communities, for perhaps two hundred years, the house was \u2018sacred space\u2019. In the 1960s the Abb\u00e9 Depuyst observed that the main problem of modern church building was to find the type of real house which today offers the deepest and most human kind of hospitality, and to think how best to adapt it for the purpose of church architecture.23 This is a challenge which has not been taken up on any level, perhaps because, in a highly individualised society, such profound hospitality is difficult to find.24 According to Mircea Eliade the house is \u2018the universe that man constructs for himself by imitating the paradigmatic creation of the gods, the 20 D. Spain, Gendered Spaces (Chapel Hill: University ofNorth Carolina Press, 1992), pp. 127\u2014135. 21 L. Mumford, The City in History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p. 256. 22 L. Michael White, Building God's House in the Roman World: Architectural Adaptation among Pagans, Jews and Christians (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), p. 109. 23 Modern Architecture and Christian Celebration. Cited in F. W. Dillistone, Traditional Symbols and the Contemporary World (London: Epworth, 1973), p. 102. 24 It invites reflection in that the poor are often, though not necessarily, the most profoundly hospitable. How could you generalise that for public architecture? If it indicated a return to the ordinary house for the eucharist, what would be the implications for the suburban community, with its own traditions of hospitality (dinner parties)? cosmogony\u2019.25 On his view the longing of homo religiosus to inhabit a divine world creates a desire that his house should be \u2018like the house of the gods\u2019.26 Eliade does not support his case with examples, though he could have referred to the Koran, which lays down precise instructions for the placement of doors and windows.27 In another sweeping statement Eliade claims: \u2018The symbolism of the centre is the formative principle not only of countries, cities, temples and palaces but also of the humblest human dwelling, be it the tent of a nomad hunter, the shepherd\u2019s yurt, or the house of the sedentary cultivator.\u201928 However that might be, Rapoport\u2019s anthropological studies showed that religion affects the form, plan, spatial arrangements and orientation of the house, and may be the influence which leads to the existence of round and rectangular houses. The reason for a culture never having had a round house, for example, may well be due to the needs of cosmic orientation, as a round house cannot easily be oriented.29 The impact of such orientation can be seen not only in Pawnee villages, which are a replica of stars in the sky, or those of the Hottentot, for whom the circle is the perfect form, but also in no nonsense Yorkshire, where streets follow the ancient Scandinavian pattern laid out according to the daily movement of the sun.30 In a celebrated lecture in 1951 Heidegger picked up on the religious significance of the dwelling house in describing a Black Forest farmhouse in which \u2018the self sufficiency of the power to let earth and heaven, divinities and mortals enter in simple oneness into things, ordered the house\u2019. It places the farm on the wind sheltered mountain slope looking south, among the meadows close to the spring. It gave it the wide overhanging shingle roof whose proper slope bears up under the burden of snow, and which, reaching deep down, shields the chamber against the storms of the long winter nights. It did not forget the altar corner behind the community table; it made room in its chamber for the hallowed places of childbed and the \u2018tree of the dead\u2019 for that is what they called a coffin there... A craft which, itself sprung from dwelling, still uses tools and frames as things, built the farmhouse.31 Heidegger mentions the \u2018altar corner\u2019, and other traditional cultures also had sacred, or privileged, areas within the house. The pious Hindu still has a place for the household god or gods, where puja (worship) is offered daily. At the turn of the second millennium in the West 25 M.

Heidegger, Poetry, language\u25a0, thought (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1971), p. 160. Christopher Day tries to design rooms which are congenial places for silence and meditation. \u2018My office as a room\u2019, he says, \u2018is a silent office, even though we talk there. It is not oppressively empty when it is empty, but peacefully at rest. It is an office more like a church than a factory... if we think of work as the raising of matter, as provision of food for the human spirit, then places of work need this sort of atmosphere.\u201932 Design is a key factor for, as Day remarks, in smooth plastered, gloss painted rooms, you need a radio, hi fi or television for company, to fill the empty space.33 Eliade\u2019s unsubstantiated assertions about the intentions of \u2018religious man\u2019 seem far too sweeping, and yet a secular philosopher like Gaston Bachelard agrees with him: \u2018Our house is our corner of the world... our first universe a real cosmos in every sense of the word.\u201934 Not only our memories, says Bachelard, but the things we have forgotten are \u2018housed\u2019. Our soul is an abode. And by remembering \u2018house\u2019 and \u2018rooms\u2019 we learn to \u2018abide\u2019 within ourselves.35 For him \u2018the house is one of the greatest powers of integration for the thoughts, memories and dreams of mankind... Without it man would be a dispersed being. It maintains him through the storms of the heavens and through those of life. It is body and soul. It is the human being\u2019s first world.\u201936 We have to measure these claims against the harsh realities of living for the vast majority of people. Are they true in Easterhouse? In the tower blocks to be found everywhere from Moscow to Chandigarh to Hong Kong? In the slums of Rio or downtown Edinburgh or Paris? In the vast suburban sprawl of London? In refugee camps in Palestine or the Balkans? What about the nine and a half million people in contemporary Britain who cannot afford to keep their homes heated and free from damp? Human experience in these places shows that it is possible to \u2018abide\u2019 without ever knowing the kind of house which Bachelard recalls. And what about the sense of the sacred? Architecture can only flourish if dwellings are in harmony with the people who live in them, with nature and culture, says Victor Papanek.37 In turn those people need to be in harmony with a larger scheme of things. If human beings are, as Marx argued, alienated, made strangers to their world, by the structures of industrial society, it is hardly surprising that poor buildings result. In nineteenth century Britain it was still the hearth, a symbol of the family, which was the focus of the sacred, if Dickens is to be believed. The kitchen table could remain such a symbol, but the habit of individual \u2018snacking\u2019 destroys some of that resonance. Has the semi 34 G. Bachelard, The Poetics of Space (Boston: Beacon, 1969), p. 5. 35 Ibid., p., xxvii. 36 Ibid., pp. 6 7. 37 Papanek, Green Imperative, p. 104. circle around the television replaced or destroyed the sacred? Has the cult of sexuality replaced it with the bedroom? \u2018It may be that the modern house orients itself to the view, beach, sun and sky, and that this orientation, and the picture window, replace the religious, symbolic orientation of the past. Therefore, a new symbol takes over \u2014 health, sun, and sport as an idea... in the United States the ideal of health becomes a new religion.\u20191 In reflecting theologically on these questions there appears to be a twofold tradition, both in scripture, and in the architectural literature on housing, which I shall attempt to follow. two houses: people and structure Gaston Bachelard\u2019s idea of a \u2018place of abiding\u2019 is sharply questioned, in the first place, by the biblical use of the term \u2018house\u2019. The Hebrew word for house, beit, is a key word in the Hebrew bible. Like the Greek oikos, which translates it in the Septuagint, it originally means the structure but, because there is no separate word for the small family unit, comes to do service for both house and family, and then for a whole people. At the beginning of the monarchy a stark contrast is set up between true and false \u2018houses\u2019. David announces his intention to build a \u2018house\u2019 (i.e. a temple) for YHWH, but the prophet Nathan intervenes, punning on the word \u2018beit\u2019: Thus says the Lord: are you the one to build me a house to live in? I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day... Then King David went in and sat before the Lord, and said, \u2018Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?\u2019 (2 Sam. 7.5 6, 18) According to this theology YHWH never dwelt in a house, but lived in a tent, and moved with the people. The very idea of a \u2018house\u2019 implies much too static a picture of one who is a \u2018wayfaring God\u2019. Judaeo Christian culture, comments Richard Sennett, is at its very roots about spiritual dislocation and homelessness. \u2018Our faith began at odds with place, because our gods themselves were disposed to wander.\u20192 This is to put it too strongly, as we shall see, but there is, to say the least, an ambivalence about settlement in Judaism and Christianity which there may not be in cosmically oriented cultures. 1 Rapoport, House, p. 132. 2 R. Sennett, The Conscience of the Eye (New York: Norton, 1990), p. 6. The promise of a \u2018house\u2019, meaning a temple, is interpolated into the story in 2 Samuel, and its fulfilment recorded in that very subtle piece of counter propaganda disguised as propaganda, 1 Kings 1 1140 The narrator tells us that Solomon spent seven years building the Temple and thirteen on his own palace, a stone built structure which, he emphasises, was extremely costly (1 Kgs 7.9 11). A judgement is clearly passed on this conspicuous consumption. Immediately after Solomon\u2019s death the kingdom disintegrates. Throughout the writings of the great prophets luxury housing is the target of some of the fiercest invective.41 Three or four centuries later we hear this comment from one of the occupants of some Old Testament Canary Wharf: I made great works; I built houses and planted vineyards for myself; I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees. I made myselfpools from which to water the forest of growing trees... I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. (Eccles. 2.4 7) All of this, he sees, is nothing but \u2018vanity\u2019 and indeed it is, because premised on injustice. There is little to support Bachelard\u2019s sense of \u2018abode\u2019 in the Hebrew bible, therefore. There is far more resonance with the ideas of bell hooks, Leonie Sandercock, or Toni Morrison. We saw in the last chapter the importance of nahalah, which implies a house, everyone dwelling under their vine and fig tree. But when we look to what is actually said about dwellings, there is little but a fierce critique of luxury housing, and an insistence on the absolute priority of political process, the people who constitute a \u2018house\u2019 over the buildings themselves. In the New Testament this relativisation of the importance of the house is radicalised. Jesus, according to Luke, was born in an outhouse and, according to Matthew, became a refugee immediately after his birth. The nineteenth century artists liked to depict Jesus \u2018at home\u2019 learning the carpenter\u2019s trade, but Jesus seems to have aligned himself with the rootless and homeless: \u2018Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head\u2019 (Luke 9.58). When this tradition is interpreted through the Christian idea of incarnation it means that God takes God\u2019s place alongside those who have no home, who lack, perhaps, even shelter. The apocryphal Ads of Thomas contains a nice story about Thomas landing in India and extracting huge sums 4 \u00b0 For this aspect of the narrative see above all, Stefan Heym, The King David Report (London: Sphere, 1984). 4 1 For example, Amos 3.15, 5.11; Isa. 3.14 15, syff.; Jer. 22.13ff. of money from the king on the promise of building him a house. No house materialises. When he is arrested for fraud he reveals that all the money has been given to the poor in order to build the king a \u2018house in heaven\u2019.42 Like Nathan, Thomas directs attention to the needs of the poor, and away from pharonic building projects. This is not to deny the need for shelter. On the contrary, God is the one who \u2018shelters you under his wings\u2019 (Ps. 61.4), who provides shelter and water for Hagar, cast out into the desert, or for Jonah overlooking Nineveh. The editor of the book of Hosea includes an oracle which promises that they shall \u2018again live beneath my shadow (tsel), they shall flourish as a garden\u2019 (Hos. 14.7). The biblical tradition, whilst critical of the housing of the rich, is not hostile to the establishing of homes as such. Rather, it offers a vision for the refugee: They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. (Isa. 65.21 2) Likewise in the gospels there is no radical condemnation of the security of the house. In Mark, for example, the house is a \u2018safe\u2019 site for the disci pleship community. \u2018There Jesus dines with the outcast (2.15; 14.3) and attends to the crowds (1.32; 3.20); it is the locus for private instruction (7.17; 9.33; 10.10) and healing. Only once is the house a site of conflict (3.2off.), and this is explained by the fact that this episode narrates the rejection of Jesus by his own family.\u201943 This helps us to understand why the house becomes the centre for early Christian worship after the resurrection. What is challenged, however, is possession and exclusive use. In the story commonly known as the \u2018rich young ruler\u2019 we find a vision of a radical re distribution of property. The story of the rich young man turns, Ched Myers argues, on the fact that he possesses many ktemata \u2014 lands. These are the properties he has acquired through the debt default of others, against the prophetic injunctions and the clear commands of Torah.44 Jesus points out that if Torah is followed there will be plenty for everyone: 42 The Apocryphal New Testament, tr. M. R. James (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1923), p. 364ff. The story is a neat inversion of the usual burden of \u2018pie in the sky when you die5. 43 C. Myers, Binding the Strong Man (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1988), p. 151. 44 G. Myers, Who Will Roll Away the Stone? (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1994). Jesus said, \u2018Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions... (Mark 1029 30) In attempting a theological reflection on the house it is essential to keep this perspective on the twofold tradition in mind. It is true that evidence of imagination and beauty is to be found in the meanest slums and shanty towns. Lefebvre writes: \u2018The vast shanty towns of Latin America manifest a social life far more intense than the bourgeois districts of the cities... these districts sometimes so effectively order their space houses, walls, public spaces as to elicit a nervous admiration.\u20191 And even the crudest shelter quickly takes on some aspect of a \u2018home\u2019, through the placing of a paper image of a deity, for example, something to mark this space as special, as somewhere to come home to. In this sense there is something to be said for Bachelard\u2019s remark that, \u2018[i]f we look at it intimately, the humblest dwelling has beauty\u2019.2 From the outside, says Janice Perlman, favellas and barrios may seem filthy and congested, with open sewers and dust and dirt flying everywhere. Things look very different from inside, however. Houses are built with a keen eye to comfort and efficiency, given the climate and available materials. Much care is evident in the arrangement of furniture and the neat cleanliness of each room. Houses often boast colourfully painted doors and shutters, and flowers or plants on the window sill. Cherished objects are displayed with love and pride.3 This is undoubtedly true, but at the same time it is essential not to romanticise poverty.4 The slum clearers were and are right that there are 1 H. Lefebvre, The Production of Space (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991), pp. 373 \u20144 2 Bachelard, Poetics, p. 4. 3 J. Perlman, The Myth of Mar Quality: Urban Poverty and Politics in Rio de Janeiro (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), pp. 242 3. 4 Cf. this description of nineteenth century London from Engels\u2019 Condition of the Working Class in England (1845), a description which recalls many Third World slums today: \u2018The houses are occupied from cellar to garret, filthy within and without, and their appearance is such that no human being could possibly wish to live in them. But all this is nothing in comparison with the dwellings in the narrow courts and alleys between the streets, entered by covered passages between the houses, in which the filth and tottering ruin surpass all description. Scarcely a whole window pane can be found, the walls are crumbling, door posts and window frames loose and broken, doors of old boards nailed together, or altogether wanting... Heaps of garbage and ash lie in all directions, and the foul liquids emptied before the doors gather in stinking pools. Here live the poorest of the poor\u2019 (Marx/Engels Collected Works $0 vols. (Moscow: Progress, 1975), vol. IV, p. 332). In Britain in 2001 there were also an estimated 3 million people who experienced homelessness, some caused by re possession the dark side of Peter Saunders\u2019 vision of a nation of homeowners, as he himself admits in his final chapter. conditions in which human beings ought not to be expected to live, and this housing is found not only in the South but in the so called \u2018developed\u2019 countries. Against this background Bachelard\u2019s \u2018Poetics of Space\u2019\u2019 can seem a trivial irrelevance. And yet it is true that human beings have found, and continue to find, great significance in the houses in which they live and invest them with meaning. two houses: vernacular and monumental Just as we have two traditions in speaking of \u2018the house\u2019 so, argues Christopher Day, we have two traditions of architecture, high and low. One concerns itself with cosmic rules proportion, geometry and classically dilferentiated elements representing material principles: relation to the earth, to the vault of the heavens, to the vertical boundaries of free stretching space... this is the stream of great architecture temples, cathedrals, sometimes palaces and civic buildings. In scale and commitment to a singular idea such buildings often dominate the surroundings. The other stream is the vernacular. Its keynote is response to climate, materials, social form and tradition. It concerns itself very much with textures, meetings of materials and tends to be rich for the senses. Almost without fail, the resulting landscape or townscape warms the soul... The high architecture stream is inspired by cosmic ideas, the vernacular stream is rooted in daily reality one is learnt by prolonged esoteric study, the other by making, doing and building, by mud, dirt and wood shavings. Both are artistic but neither is complete or balanced without the other: they need to be brought into conversation.1 Day\u2019s twofold distinction corresponds to the Sri Lankan theologian Aloysius Pieris\u2019 distinction between cosmic and metacosmic religions: high and literate traditions on the one hand, with their great scriptures, buildings, works of art and great music, and folk religion on the other, with its small local shrines, folk dances and folk music.2 Like Day he believes neither tradition can be dispensed with. The American architectural critic J. B. Jackson likewise speaks of a twofold tradition, between houses built to last and those with a life expectancy of a generation or less, \u2018mansions\u2019 and \u2018dwellings\u2019. A dwelling, he argues, is a makeshift place, more or less thrown together, often moveable and not of much consequence if destroyed.

Leave the goodly fabrics of houses, for beauty only, to the enchanted palaces of the poets, who build them at small cost.\u2019 The vernacular is by and large a tradition of great simplicity. The word \u2018vernacular\u2019 comes from the Latin verna, meaning a slave born in the household, and by extension the life of one confined to a village or estate. Thus a vernacular culture implies \u2018a way of life ruled by tradition and custom, entirely remote from the larger world of politics and law; a way of life where identity derived not from permanent possession of land but from membership in a group or super family\u2019.52 This dominance of tradition means that vernacular building \u2018displays very few devices not found in primitive buildings\u2019.53 Lefebvre remarks of a peasant dwelling that it is \u2018an object intermediate between work and product, between nature and labour, between the realm of symbols and the realm of signs\u2019.54 The German word for peasant, Bauer, points up the connection between the peasant and building.55 Adolf Loos puts this epigrammatically in remarking that \u2018 [t]he houses of peasants are shaped by the hand of God\u2019.5\u00ae What he means by this is the way in which vernacular architecture responds so subtly to its region that it seems to be a \u2018natural\u2019 creation. Think of the igloo, with its L shaped tunnel, to trap the wind, its raised sleeping platform, its ventilation louvres, its rounded shape to deflect fierce winds. It is a masterpiece of engineering. Rapoport speaks of the \u2018amazing skill\u2019 shown by primitive and peasant builders in dealing with climatic problems and their ability to use minimum resources for maximum 52 Ibid., p.149. 53 Rapoport, House, p. 121. 54 Lefebvre, Production, p. 83. 55 Talking of Chipping Camden, in Gloucestershire, Branford and Geddes remark: \u2018You ask who planned and erected these buildings and ordered their layout and their proportions, so that the whole, from great church to cottage, unites into a single harmony. You are told it was the work of local masons, who built without architects and, as it were, like bees, by tradition, not by book learning.\u2019 V Branford and P. Geddes, The Coming Polity (London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1919), p 132 56 \u2018May I take you to the shores of a mountain lake? The sky is blue, the water is green and everything is at peace. The mountains and clouds are reflected in the lake, as are the houses, farms and chapels. They do not seem man made, but more like the product of God\u2019s workshop, like the mountains and trees, the clouds and the blue sky. And everything breathes beauty and tranquillity.\u2019 \u2018Architecture, 1910\u2019 in The Architecture of Adolf Loos, an Arts Council exhibition (London: Arts Council, 1985). comfort. \u2018The Eskimo has only snow and ice, fur and bone, and some driftwood; the Sudanese have mud, reeds and some palm logs... the marsh dwellers of Iraq have only reeds. While this scarcity does not determine form, it does make some solutions impossible and reduces the choice to an extent, depending on the severity of the limitations.\u201957 \u2018It is perhaps symptomatic of professional blindness\u2019, says Jeffrey Cook, \u2018that the often amazing comfort and environmental performances of vernacular architecture continue to be largely ignored by professional designers of the built environment.\u201958 The vernacular has been defined as \u2018a common sense approach built out of necessity\u2019. Ecologically there are many advantages in making a virtue out of necessity. Traditionally we built according to our limits. Today, however, there are no apparent limits. Building form is defined by our technology, by global markets and by consumer taste. Traditionally, resources had to be used wisely, because their scarcity and the effort needed to manufacture them were automatically understood. We now use more and more of them, and bring them from further and further away.59 The vernacular tradition responded to local climate conditions, and also embodied a deep knowledge of, and respect for, its materials: it understood the difference between beech, oak and pine, the capacities and limitations of granite or limestone, of slate or marl, and it adapted design accordingly.60 The vernacular, however, represents response not just to climate and materials, but to social form and tradition. \u2018The folk tradition\u2019, says Rapoport, \u2018is the direct and unselfconscious translation into physical form of a culture, its needs and values as well as the desires, dreams and passions of a people.\u201961 Vernacular architecture manifested no \u2018libido dmdnandV, none of the desire to dominate which Augustine believed characterised the earthly city.62 5 ?

The latter were chosen, partly on grounds of cost, and incorporated large glass walls. As everyone who lived in them noted, the architect was rightly called \u2018Baker5. A short step away in the centre of the city vernacular houses allowed a passage of air, and deep shade, which offered relief and made life bearable, even in the very height of summer. Rapoport, House&gt; p. 2; cf. Vance: \u2018Self conscious architecture withers without public adulation, so only the vernacular form can live in the crowded area of organic growth.5 J. E. Vance, The Continuing City (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), p. 50. Thomas Sharp argued that all houses should harmonise with their landscape. Of course, in Manhattan that might mean building a skyscraper, but in the towns and villages of which he was thinking he thought rootedness was essential to good housing and this is part of the vernacular tradition, as houses were all built from local materials, as we have seen. In modern housing, by contrast, everything may be imported.1 In addition to the need for harmony Simon Fairlie suggests that \u2018irrectitude\u2019 \u2014 a lack of straightness is desirable, on the grounds that \u2018Nature abhors a straight line\u2019. The lines of vernacular buildings are \u2018soft, blurred, gently inclined or wavering; they are distinct from the landscape, yet remain at home within their setting of rolling hills or burgeoning foliage\u2019.2 The modern brick built villa, whatever stylistic concessions it may make to the local vernacular, imposes an artificial geometry upon the landscape. Its rigid outline, its mechanical tiling, its machined window frames, its telephone wires and TV aerial... all speak of another world. Distinctiveness has turned into intrusion, aspiration has become arrogance, and Nature has been relegated to the status ofbackdrop a \u2018view\u2019.3 The Viennese painter Hundertwasser found modernist architecture \u2018morally unendurable\u2019 and preferred the \u2018material uninhabitability of the slums\u2019 to the \u2018moral uninhabitability of functional, utilitarian architecture\u2019.4 \u2018These days houses in many places look as if they are ready to leave,\u2019 commented Ernst Bloch, with special reference to Bauhaus functionalism. \u2018In fact, the sensitivity of western architecture goes so far that it sensed Hitler\u2019s war quite a long time in advance, in a roundabout way, and prepared for it.\u2019 It exhibited, he said, a complete bankruptcy of ideas.5 This critique of the architecture of much of the twentieth century, both modern and postmodern, is well taken. At the same time we must not romanticise the buildings of the past which, where they survive, are now often sold as \u2018dream houses\u2019.6 In a country where most vernacular 1 T.

Cobbett, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, commented on thatched cottages: \u2018[Near Cricklade] the labourers seem miserably poor. Their dwellings are little better than pig beds, and their looks indicate that their food is not nearly equal to that of a pig. Their wretched hovels architecture has disappeared, like Britain, what survives are the houses of the better off artisans. Much vernacular building was undoubtedly wretched and often condemned in the early twentieth century as rural slums.69 On the other hand, as we have seen, it also had great virtues. Unselfconsciousness, lack of pretension or desire to impress, direct response to away of life, climate and technology, use of the \u2018model and variations\u2019 method of building, the attitude towards nature and landscape, all play a part in the beauty, simplicity and effectiveness of vernacular architecture.70 Fairlie\u2019s remarks on the vernacular raise the question whether it is not essentially rural, and whether it has any place in a world which is now more than half urban. Could a new vernacular meet the needs of sustainability? In one sense it certainly could, for 1 [v] ernacular buildings waste nothing: they hate to destroy a structure, and will adapt the most unlikely buildings for new purposes\u2019.71 By \u2018vernacular\u2019 here I do not mean the neo vernacular of contemporary architect designed houses, \u2018voiles vernacular\u2019, but the emergence of a genuine vernacular, which is to say, that of the people of a distinct region. In Britain it seems extraordinary that between a third and a half of the world\u2019s population still build their own homes, and that self help accounts for 40 per cent of domestic building in Belgium, West Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Norway, Finland, and Ireland. In Britain it is well under 10 per cent.72 Colin Ward and Simon Fairlie have recorded the difficulties people encounter when they set out to build for themselves. Whereas speculators and the rich can do what they like, the poor are obstructed by planning regulations at every turn. This is due in part to the professionalisation of knowledge which, as Ivan Illich argued, \u2018makes people dependent on having their knowledge produced for them\u2019 and leads to \u2018a paralysis of the moral and political imagination\u2019.73 Not just of the moral and political, but of the practical imagination. Creativity is supposed to be for the gifted few and the rest of us are compelled to live in environments constructed by them. Building upon this lie, says Simon Nicholson, are stuck upon bits of ground on the road side It seems as if they had been swept off the fields by a hurricane, and found shelter under the banks on the road side!\u2019 Cited in R.

This difference between Britain and continental Europe is one of many which follow from the fact that Britain was the first country to industrialise, and eradicated its peasantry more effectively, and earlier, than any other. Saunders, Jfation, p. 13. 73 Cited in Ward, Talking to Architects, p. 20. the dominant cultural elite tell us that the planning, design and building of any part of the environment is so difficult and so special that only... those with degrees and certificates in planning, engineering, architecture, art, education, behavioural psychology and so on can properly solve environmental problems. The result is that the vast majority of people are not allowed (and worse feel that they are incompetent) to experiment with the components of building. The majority of the community has been deprived of a crucial part of their lives and lifestyle.74 Until \u2018all the Lord\u2019s people are prophets\u2019 we cannot have a new vernacular. But if we apply the criteria developed in the first chapter, which follow from the manifestation of God in and through the humble and modest, surely there is a strong theological case for its re discovery? At the opposite end of the scale to vernacular building is the monumental, buildings designed either to overawe the populace, or to impress the owner\u2019s peer group by their demonstration of wealth and good taste. Though Bacon began his essay on building with a caution about building to impress, it is of course monumental building he has in mind: The servants\u2019 dining area, he warns, should be at the top of the stairs, \u2018For otherwise you shall have the servants\u2019 dinner after your own: for the steam of it will come up as in a tunnel.\u2019 And that is all he has to offer for the labouring classes. As we see from the stories about Solomon, the great house represents an ancient tradition. In imperial Rome, where the patrician houses were spacious, equipped with bathrooms, heated in winter by hypocausts which carried hot air through chambers in the floor, they constituted, in Mumford\u2019s view, \u2018perhaps the most commodious and comfortable houses built for a temperate climate anywhere until the twentieth century\u2019.75 From the European Renaissance on, this tradition has littered the countryside with its products, aspiring, as Henry Crawford puts it in Jane Austen\u2019s Mansfield Park, to turn \u2018a house\u2019 into \u2018a place\u2019. Today such \u2018places\u2019 constitute the bulk of our \u2018heritage\u2019. Raymond Williams offers a trenchant and necessary comment on this tradition: People still pass from village to village, guidebook in hand, to see the next and yet the next example, to look at the stones and the furniture. But stand at any point and look at the land. Look at what those fields, those streams, those woods even today produce. Think it through as labour and see how long and systematic the exploitation and seizure must have been, to rear that many houses, on that scale. See, by contrast, what any ancient isolated farm, in uncounted generations of labour, has managed to become, by the efforts of any single real family... And then turn and look at what these other \u2018families\u2019, these systematic owners, have accumulated and arrogantly declared. It isn\u2019t only that you know, looking at the land and then at the house, how much robbery and fraud there must have been, for so long, to produce that degree of disparity, that barbarous disproportion of scale. The working farms and cottages are so small beside them... What these \u2018great\u2019 houses do is to break the scale, by an act of will corresponding to their real and systematic exploitation of others. To stand in that shadow, even today, is to know what many generations of countrymen bitterly learned and were consciously taught: that these were the families, this the shape of society. And will you then think of community?76 Williams echoes the scathing critiques of Isaiah or Jeremiah and raises for us the question of historical memory. If\u2018heritage\u2019 is largely the great house does this serve to glorify or perpetuate the social relationships which produced it? But would we be better off without this aspect of our culture? He also raises the question of class. The British Conservative administration of the 1980s encouraged the building of new mansions on the grounds that they were a legacy for the future, but for whom? Do we need this kind of \u2018high art\u2019 tradition? Would we be better off entirely without it? Is it sufficient to wander around the great houses remembering, with Walter Benjamin, that every monument of culture is at the same time a monument of barbarism? These are questions which ought to be discussed by the community of faith, but on which there has never been consensus, as we could see by comparing, say, Eusebius of Caesarea, the panegyrist of Constantine and his building programme, and John Chrysostom, the scourge of the rich in fourth century Constantinople. MASS HOUSING Mass housing was not the invention of the nineteenth century. In imperial Rome the proletariat lived in some forty six thousand tenements containing around two hundred people each.77 After the decline of Rome, however, we have to wait for the late middle ages, at least in Europe, before we find multi storey tenement blocks, and the conditions of ancient Rome were not equalled until the industrial revolution which was 76 Williams, Country, pp. 105 6. 77 In stark contrast to the patrician residences these tenements, says Mumford, \u2018easily take the prize for being the most crowded and insanitary buildings produced in Western Europe until the sixteenth century... not only were these buildings unheated, unprovided with waste pipes or water closets, unadapted to cooking; not merely did they contain an undue number of airless rooms, indecently overcrowded... they were in addition so badly built and so high that they offered no means of safe exit from the frequent fires that occurred\u2019 (City, p. 256). in various ways responsible for the decline of vernacular building. Partly because it was coincident with a great increase in population, and the growth of great cities at the same time, it usually led to the \u2018throwing up\u2019 of thousands of houses on the cheap. Partly it signalled the advent of mass production, which was antithetical to the local trades and traditions which had produced the vernacular. \u2018Man is regressing to the cave dwelling\u2019, wrote Marx in 1845, but in an alienated malignant form.\u2019 The savage in his cave (a natural element which is freely offered for his use and protection) does not feel himself a stranger; on the contrary he feels as much at home as a fish in water. But the cellar dwelling of the poor man is a hostile dwelling, \u2018an alien, constricting power which only surrenders itself to him in exchange for blood and sweat\u2019. He cannot regard it as his home, as a place where he might at last say, \u2018here I am at home\u2019. Instead, he finds himself in another person\u2019s house, the house of a stranger who lies in wait for him every day and evicts him if he does not pay the rent.78 Here what Marx has in mind is not so much the actual physical conditions of the house, but the fact that the poor had no control over it and could be evicted at will. More than a century later John Turner agreed with him, finding the \u2018hideousness of characteristic modern housing\u2019 to be but a reflection of \u2018the defilement of personal relations and the desecration of life, as well as the dirtying of the environment\u2019.79 Mumford applied the same verdict to all industrial housing, where he found, in \u2018block after block\u2019: the same dreary streets; the same shadowed, rubbish filled alleys, the same absence of open spaces for children\u2019s play and gardens; the same lack of coherence and individuality to the local neighbourhoods... no effort is made to orient the street pattern with respect to sunlight and winds... The age of invention and mass production scarcely touched the worker\u2019s house or its utilities until the end of the nineteenth century.80 If this was a belle epoque, he comments, it belonged to the bourgeoisie. For the working class what was provided was minimal living space, the lowest possible threshold of tolerability.81 This was true even of buildings which set out to remedy the slum problem, such as the Peabody buildings in London which had a slum density of 300 to 450 people per acre. By the 1880s some of the working class, at least, could afford to move out to new row housing. \u2018As in housing for the privileged, these modest row houses consisted of uniform blocks, with individual small yards and outhouses in the back.\u2019 Though middle class critics thought the architectural quality was appalling, \u2018[b]y working class standards... the house was an immense achievement. People slept on a different floor than they ate; the smell of urine and faeces no longer pervaded the interior.\u201982 In continental Europe and North America the apartment block offered a mediating form between mass housing and suburbia, providing, chiefly for the middle class, accommodation which was popular and often elegant, as well as being built according to human scale and avoiding urban sprawl. Great efforts were made to clear the slums and, in both the socialist bloc and in countries like Britain, national or local government stepped in to build houses on a large scale. The principle behind this building programme was excellent: the provision of decent, affordable, and secure housing for all. To vest it in local government or the state also meant that it was not subject to the \u2018discipline of the market\u2019, where poorer tenants could be priced out, but that standards and rents were democratically accountable.83 These principles remain important, but there was a crucial factor missing in the provision of mass housing, namely, the involvement of the people who had to live in the houses. The key issues raised by mass housing are those of ownership, design, and empowerment. Alice Coleman, in a famous study, laid the blame for the perceived failure of planned housing on what she calls a \u2018quasi religious\u2019 belief in the perfectibility of human nature, by which she meant ideals about public ownership as opposed to private.84 She found that ownership was a key factor. Litter, graffiti, excrement, and so on were, she found, twice as common in council owned blocks of flats as in owner occupied.85 In his survey of three British towns, Peter Saunders found that tenants are much less inclined to develop attachments to their houses than are 82 Sennett, Flesh and Stone, p. 334. So also Saunders, Nation, p. 149, pointing out the huge fall in numbers of people sharing a room between 1951 and 1976, and citing the view that \u2018[t]he poor live in what would have been thought of in the pre capitalist period as ill maintained castles\u2019. 83 In Britain at the beginning ofthe third millennium Government favours replacing council housing with housing associations. It is, however, much easier to evict housing association tenants. There are seventeen grounds for eviction, some automatic. Rents are higher, and there is no democratic control through the election of local councillors. 84 A. Coleman, Utopia on Trial: Vision and Reality in Planned Housing (London: Shipman, 1985), p. 3, citing Philip Johnson with approval. She herself is accused of having a biologically deterministic view of human nature which played into the hands of right wing councils eager to shed their responsibilities to care for the poor. J. Morris and M. Winn, Housing and Social Inequality (London: Shipman, 1990), pp. i69ff. 85 Coleman, Utopia, p. 23!!. owners.1 In Britain much of the problem, as noted in chapter 2, was a prohibition on doing any improvements to the property whatever, a sure fire recipe for alienation.2 Bureaucratic rigidity and racial and gender inequalities and discrimination have also played their part.3 Alongside the question of ownership, design is also a key factor. Why is it that the estates of Raymond Unwin remain attractive today, where tower blocks, by and large, are not? An answer may lie in the contrast of the Guild socialism of Unwin, which was romantic, intimate and humanist, and the technocratic and authoritarian vision of Le Corbusier. He divided the residential area of his radiant city into two types: six storey luxury apartments for the elite with 85 per cent of the ground left free, on the one hand, and accommodation for the workers, built around courts, on the other, with 49 per cent of the ground left free. The architecture which this authoritarian and classist ideology led to were the tower blocks of the second half of the twentieth century. In Britain they formed a major part of the massive public building programme four million homes \u2014 between 1945 and 1969. Tower blocks stood for modernity, sunlight and glass as opposed to soot, damp and narrow back to backs. They also addressed the problem of suburban sprawl. In the view of many, however, they failed. They \u2018were built for community. They worked for solitude.\u20194 The Pruitt Igoe scheme in the United States is symbolic of them as a whole. Completed in 1955 6 they were dynamited in 1972, having proved unlettable and a focus for vandalism and street crime. The post mortem on the scheme emphasised that the architect had designed like a sculptor, seeing the grounds of the project as nothing more than a surface on which he was endeavouring to arrange a whole series of vertical elements into a compositionally pleasing whole. The social dynamics of these buildings, remarks Peter Hall, had not been thought through. They were put up without regard to people\u2019s preferences. \u2018The cold brutality of the architecture made the blocks feel bleak and comfortless, and alienation, loneliness, and stress became common experiences.\u20195 1 Saunders, Nation, p. 294. 2 Saunders gives many examples: \u2018We wanted to combine the bathroom and the outside toilet but they wouldn\u2019t agree. We wanted to rip a fireplace out and they wouldn\u2019t agree. We ripped a hedge out to make a driveway without asking because it\u2019s a waste of time the answer\u2019s always \u201cno\u201d\u2019 (ibid., p. 91).

Flail, Cities of Tomorrow (Oxford: Blackwell, 1988), p. 238. Studies conducted in Britain found that psychoneurotic illnesses were three times higher in multi storey buildings than in low level detached buildings.1 Even here, away from the tower blocks, mass housing is often characterised by what Jane Jacobs calls a \u2018great blight of dullness\u2019. It is well known, says the Dutch architect Nicholas Habraken, that all the products of mass housing are marked by an appearance of uniformity. \u2018The only way to ensure uniformity is the rigorous exclusion of individual man... Nature knows no uniformity, but seeks ever greater variety.\u20192 Mass housing represents an institutionalised, regimented, view of human nature. Aside from uniformity Coleman found fifteen design faults, including the number of dwellings per block, spatial organisation, the use of overhead walkways, the number of storeys, and the use of corridors, all of which made \u2018an iniquitous imposition upon people who cannot cope with them\u2019.3 Her recommendations included a strong affirmation of Robert Frost\u2019s dictum, \u2018Good fences make good neighbours.\u2019 Contemplating twentieth century mass housing, Bachelard\u2019s verdict is severe: \u2018In Paris there are no houses, and the inhabitants of the big city live in superimposed boxes.\u201994 This verdict might call into question Bachelard\u2019s whole romantic and oneiric account of \u2018the house\u2019; on the other hand we could say that all such housing reflects a devastatingly inadequate account of what it means for human beings to be made in the image of God and housed accordingly. On top of ownership and design, however, is the question of involvement. One of the key differences of mass building from the vernacular, apart from the question of scale, is that it is conceived and executed \u2018top down\u2019, the crux of Alice Coleman\u2019s case. Tower blocks were not created by people in the community, for themselves, but either by \u2018experts\u2019 or by councils looking for cheap housing solutions. \u2018Rarely were people asked whether they wanted to move into a box in the sky,\u2019 comments Herbert Girardet.95 The need for consultation has been a central contention of Nicholas Habraken, John Turner and Colin Ward, who find the key to the problem in people being able to control their own environment. \u2018The inhabitants of a Mass Housing town cannot possess their town,\u2019 wrote Habraken. \u2018They remain lodged in an environment which is no part of themselves... what happens to day is nothing but the production 1 H.

By contrast, \u2018when we contemplate the projects intended to house or rehouse the masses through corporate agencies, public or private, capitalist or communist, our only possible conclusion is that never before was so little done for so many with so much\u2019.1 2 Turner argues that when dwellers control the major decisions and are free to make their own contribution to the design both the process and the environment produced stimulate individual and social well being. When they have no control the opposite is the case.3 A decade before Turner Hundertwasser was arguing in Vienna that \u2018[ejveryone ought to be able and compelled to build, so that he bears real responsibility for the four walls within which he lives\u2019.4 Following the Fiabitat Conference of 1976 social regeneration budgets came to require community consultation for their awarding, but we are still light years away from Turner\u2019s \u2018building by people\u2019. The same points about control apply to interiors, as we saw in relation to council housing in the second chapter. The distrust of the ability of ordinary people to think and act for themselves which this exemplifies found paradigmatic expression in Le Corbusier, who notoriously had no time for individual idiosyncracy. \u2018We must never lose sight of the perfect human \u201cCell\u201d \u2019, he wrote, \u2018the cell which corresponds most perfectly to our physiological and sentimental needs. We must arrive at the \u201chouse machine\u201d which must be both practical and emotionally satisfying and designed for a succession of tenants.\u2019 This anti humanist philosophy was shared by \u2018experts\u2019 in child rearing, education and others at the time, all obsessed by what Mumford called the \u2018myth of the machine\u2019.5 In all these areas it has proved equally damaging and has had to be abandoned. SUBURBAN HOUSING In the nineteenth century a new mode of housing made its appearance, neither elite nor vernacular suburban. Suburbs in themselves were not new, but the rise of a new middle class brought with it the demand for a new type of housing. The very first of these houses, in the 1820s, were 1 Habraken, Housing Supports, p. 13. 2 C. Ward, When We Build Again (London: Pluto, 1985), p. 70. 3 Quoted in ibid., p. 64. 4 Cited in Harries, Function, p. 240. 4 100 Habraken believes that Le Corbusier\u2019s \u2018 machine a habiter was meant \u2018poetically5 and that it was 5 functionalism which turned it into a slogan. Housing Supports, p. 17. a continuation of elite building, but the process of cultural seepage had already produced pattern books for the salaried classes by 1835. This housing was architect designed, and from the start the emphasis was on difference. An estate like that in North Oxford is a good example of what could be achieved for the upper middle class in the second half of the nineteenth century. Built for tradesmen, clergy, and a few of the dons who were newly allowed to marry, the houses are all different, with a wealth of individual detail.1 Dislike of monotony was a predominant and recurring feature of Victorian criticism. \u2018The freedom of each architect, each householder to express himself as he saw fit had moral and political as well as aesthetic significance. The facade was to represent the special creative vision of the designer, just as the house represented the independence and identity of the family it contained.\u20192 Some are quite heavily \u2018gothicised\u2019, with fairy tale windows and turrets, but most are content with varied roof lines and individual porches. A stone\u2019s throw away are the cottages which provided houses for the servants who worked here, and for the University, providing altogether humbler dwellings. As cultural seepage continued so the element of difference became more and more attenuated. In Britain nearly three million suburban homes were designed by unqualified assistants or from pattern books between the wars.3 In the United States the Levitts built 17,000 homes for 82,000 people using prefabricated materials and standardised designs. In Peter Hall\u2019s judgement, \u2018Levittown is dull. The residential streets are slightly too long, wide and straight. It lacks imagination or visual delight.\u2019104 Mumford\u2019s verdict is still more severe, describing the suburbs as \u2018a multitude of uniform, unidentifiable houses, lined up inflexibly, at uniform distances, on uniform roads, in a treeless communal waste, inhabited by people of the same class, the same income, the same age group... Thus the ultimate effect of the suburban escape in our time is, ironically, a low grade uniform environment from which escape is impossible.\u2019105 Herbert Gans, who conducted his field work by living in Levittown, replied to this that it represented a thinly veiled attack on the culture of working and lower middle class people, implying that mass produced housing leads to mass produced lives. Only the rich can afford custom built housing, he pointed out, and these charges were not levelled against the upper class terraces of the eighteenth and nineteenth 1 T. Hinchcliffe, North Oxford (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1992), p. 49. 2 Edwards, Design, p. 22. 3 Hall, Cities of Tomorrow, p. 76. 3 104 Ibid., p. 296. 105 Mumford, City, p. 553. centuries.1 Others point out that even Levittown has softened over the years, and because suburban dwellers continually make little changes to both house and garden there is a great deal of difference on the micro scale. Gans insisted that it was a good place to live, and its popularity has held.2 James Richards, who somewhat implausibly celebrated the anarchic spirit of suburbia, thought that the fact that the modern suburban style can produce similar effects to English picturesque casually and as if by instinct constituted a proof that it is a form of the vernacular.3 These defenders of suburbia are justified to the extent that the suburbs remain a popular destination. Colin Ward contrasts the success of the suburban house with the failure of the municipal estate. The difference, he points out, was not in the quality of building, but that in one people had control and in the other they did not.4 THE NEED FORA NEW VERNACULAR At the millennium world population stands at more than six billion, the last billion added in just twelve years. Current estimates are 9 billion by 2050, but this may well be an underestimate. We are familiar with the question of how they are to be fed and watered, but the question of how they are to be housed is also urgent, given the fact that the majority of the world\u2019s population live in poverty. Rapoport argues that four objectives need to be borne in mind for successful housing: it should have social and cultural validity; it should be sufficiently economical to ensure that the greatest number can afford it;5 it should ensure the maintenance of the health of the occupants;6 and finally, there should be a minimum of maintenance over the life of a building.7 The need for social and cultural validity raises the obvious question of what constitutes validity. Colin Ward points out that in the new city of Milton Keynes the houses that are most disliked are those designed by the most prestigious architects, whilst the most sought after are those 1 H. Gans, The Levittowners (London: Allen Lane, 1967). 2 H. Gans, People, Plans and Policies: Essays on Poverty ; Racism and Other National Urban Problems (New York: Columbia University Press: 1991), p. 140. 3 I0^ J. M. Richards, Castles on the Ground: The Anatomy of Suburbia (London: John Murray 1973) (1 st edn 1946), p. 30. 4 Ward, When We Build Again, p. 18. 5 In primitive and vernacular contexts, Rapoport notes, most, if not all, people have houses, as opposed to the situation under any form of capitalism. 6 In relation to climate, he says, traditional housing succeeds, in relation to sanitation and parasites it usually fails. 7 Rapoport, House, p. 129. which most resemble the traditional image of house and home, with a pitched roof and a chimney on top, and a front porch with roses round the door.113 Part of the reason for this is, of course, lay disenchantment with contemporary art in general. It is also, however, to do with a pattern of alienation in the built environment which echoes the analysis of the early Marx. The architect, says Papanek, is commissioned by a speculator, himself acting for an investor. The person who lives in the house stands in no direct relationship to the chain of talent, speculation, greed, know how and craft which produces the house. \u2018The end user\u2019s only contribution seems to lie in passively adapting to land rights, market forces, existing structures and decisions made for and about him or her.\u2019114 For this reason Habraken calls for individual involvement \u2018to break the bonds of Mass Housing\u2019. Mass Housing, he argues, was an emergency measure which became generalised, and which we need to abandon.\u201c5 His solution is for \u2018supports\u2019 \u2014 concrete frameworks, with mains services connected, which people can then fashion to their own design.\"6 For many years John Turner and Colin Ward have argued a similar position.\u201c7 What Rapoport calls cultural validity Turner speaks of in terms of dweller control: When dwellers control the major decisions and are free to make their own contributions in the design, construction, or management of their housing, both this process and the environment produced stimulate individual and social wellbeing. When people have no control over nor responsibility for key decisions in the housing process, on the other hand, dwelling environments may instead become a barrier to personal fulfilment and a burden on the economy.\"8 It is dweller control which is the key. Saunders argues that ownership contributes to our sense of self and identity, and this would a fortiori be the case with self build.\"9 Although Turner insists that self build can produce good housing on any criteria over a period of years, he does not want a situation where people are compelled to build their own houses, nor does he reject all high technology. Rather, he argues that planning should be proscriptive, warding off bad practice, rather than prescriptive, n3 Ward, When We Build Again, p. 88. 114 Papanek, Green Imperative, p. 127. 115 Habraken, Housing Supports, p. 24. 116 Habraken described supports as \u2018constructions which are not in themselves dwellings... but which contain individual dwellings as a bookcase contains books... a construction which allows the provision of dwellings which can be built, altered and taken down, independently of others\u2019 ibid., pp. 59 60. 117 Turner, Housing by People ; J. E G. Turner and R. Fichter, Freedom to Build: Dweller Control of the Housing Process (London: Macmillan, 1972); Ward, Housing. 118 Turner and Fichter, Freedom to Build, p. 241. 119 Saunders, Nation, p. 80. and that central government\u2019s major role is in providing infrastructure. His experience in the United States, the Lewisham example cited earlier, and Hans Harms\u2019 history of self build in Germany show that this is not an option only for the Third World, but that it can make perfect sense in the North too.1 The houses Turner speaks of are often energy efficient, and thus sustainable, a key feature of any contemporary building, but we also need to note William Morris\u2019 demand that housing for ordinary people should be beautiful. Every person should be ensured, said Morris, \u2018first, Honourable and fitting work; Second, A healthy and beautiful house; Third, Full leisure for rest of mind and body\u2019.2 Despite the lack of comment on the house in the Christian Scriptures I believe these demands follow squarely from what they have to say about what it means to be human. Morris loathed in particular the utilitarianism of the nineteenth century. The word expressed, he thought, \u2018a quality pretty nearly the opposite of useful, and means something which is useful for nothing save squeezing money out of other people\u2019s necessities\u2019.3 If we ask why mass housing has so often been a disaster then the utilitarian ethos which inspired it is very often to blame. For Morris, \u2018[a] house, a knife, a cup, a steam engine... anything that is made by man and has form, must either be a work of art or destructive to art\u2019.4 He insisted that people should have nothing in their houses which was not either useful or beautiful.5 Morris was famous for his rages, and what he would have made of the twentieth century house one can only imagine. \u2018It has remained for our own generation\u2019, the Goodmans commented acidly in 1947, \u2018to perfect the worst possible community arrangement the home of the average American.\u2019 This home is liberally supplied with furniture and the comforts of private life, but these private things are neither made nor chosen by personal creation or idiosyncratic taste, but are made in a distant factory and distributed by unresisted 1 J.

It \u2018demonstrates that the light which has shone throughout history until the intrusion of the man made commodity, and fills all our museums, has not been extinguished in the Bauhaus and similar hollow cheering\u2019 (. Principle, p. 387). advertising. At home they exhaust by their presence a bare cell would give more peace or arouse less restlessness. They print private life with public meaning. But if we turn to read this public meaning, we find that the only moral aim of society is to provide private satisfactions called the \u2018standard of living\u2019. This is remarkable. The private places have public faces, as Auden said, but the public faces are supposed to imitate private faces.1 An artefact is better if it is aesthetically pleasing, says Wolterstorff, echoing Morris. Perhaps the ugly concrete block flats in lower class housing developments serve rather effectively the housing needs of those who live in them. Yet they are not good houses not as good as they could be. Something is missing, something of the joy that rightfully belongs to human life, something of the satisfaction that aesthetically good housing would produce in those who dwell there.2 These aims demand, as some Green thinkers have argued, and as Turner and Ward imply, a search for a new vernacular. The vernacular is the language of ordinary people. According to Rapoport it is the sharing of a world view, and other image and value systems, which makes possible the process of vernacular building.3 In many cases traditional buildings, which used wood or stone, are now too costly to build, but also the common shared value system and image of the world which they expressed has been lost.4 Victor Papanek has shown that there is no need for contemporary vernacular building to take the form of a nostalgic throw back to the past. New materials can be used, new functions designed for, but the principles of the vernacular can still be honoured.5 In the older industrialised world, however, it is the loss of shared value systems which is the key problem. This is the reason that, as Gillian Darley points out, the \u2018neo vernacular\u2019 of postmodernism is as alienated in its way as the modernism it succeeds.6 A new vernacular must be precisely that: genuinely of the people. It is this which Turner 1 P. Goodman and P. Goodman, Communitas: Means of Livelihood and Ways of Life (New York: Random House, i960 (1 st edn 1947), p. 184. 2 N. Wolterstorff, Art in Action (Carlisle: Solway, 1997), p. 170. 3 Rapoport, House, p. 48. 4 Ibid., p. 6. 4 129 Papanek, Green Imperative, p. 137. He remarks that the Hopi Indians are building motels with 5 souvenir shops \u2018without sacrificing their own vernacular approach to space and place5. 6 G. Darley, \u2018Local Distinctiveness: An Architectural Conundrum5, in Local Distinctiveness: Place, Particularity and Identity (London: Common Ground, 1993) She writes: \u2018Superficial neo tradi tionalism has gone a long way towards destroying and devaluing precisely the traditional qualities that professionals and the lay public alike believe that they are safeguarding.5 Harries likewise talks of re building in post war Germany which borrowed certain aspects of the vernacular \u2018without preserving the former\u2019s life5. Function, p. 272. was asking for in his three principles of self government in local affairs and the freedom to build; the use of the least necessary power, weight and size of tools for the job; and the confinement of planning to an essentially legislative role, and separating it clearly from design.1 A quarter of a century after his plea state housing is far less in evidence, but the building of speculators is often little less heteronomous. Building by people is still not a policy option. Put theologically these demands for new housing can be translated into a threefold, or trinitarian, form. In virtue of the theology of creation the theologian is concerned for an ecologically sustainable mode of building; in virtue of the concern for justice we need to affirm, with the post Second World War US government, the right of everyone \u2018to a decent house in a suitable living environment\u2019;'2 in virtue of belief in the Spirit at work in all that makes for life, we are concerned with houses which speak to the human soul. CD creation: housing for six billion has to be ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE At present, as Ian Lowe puts it, \u2018Many buildings in cities combine so many features of bad design that they might have been sponsored by the electricity industry to boost flagging sales.\u20193 4 Sustainability has to be a key feature of building in the future. How is this to be achieved? Much can be done with existing housing stock, as the Wise group has shown in Glasgow, where thousands of otherwise rather poor homes have been insulated and draught proofed by a scheme using unemployed people.'34 When new building is involved, the autonomous house, which meets all its energy and recycling needs, has justifiably attracted a great deal of attention. Autonomous houses have been built in Freiburg and Southall, by Robert and Brenda Vale, which store and filter rainwater, have composting toilets and so on. Perhaps more radically, earth sheltered houses have been developed at Hockerton in Nottinghamshire, and Newark Council have agreed to build more of these to accommodate council tenants. These houses provide all their own energy, collect their own 1 Turner, Housing by People, p. 155. 2 D. Harvey, Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 394. 3 I.

They are much cheaper to build than conventional houses, and make a minimal impact on the environment. At Hockerton every adult member of the community is required to undertake some work in growing vegetables and tending the garden.1 Depending upon how the environmental crisis develops such ideas could prove a crucial part of the future. At present the problem is precisely with generalisation. It is partly that Hockerton seems to demand a lifestyle commitment which most people would not find attractive, but also that Hockerton is land hungry, and this precludes it being adopted on a very large scale. There is also a problem with design. At Milton Keynes the energy efficient houses were unpopular because they looked strange. In pursuit of sustainability \u2018an imagery was projected which most people found incomprehensible\u2019.2 For this reason Peter Smith, the Chair of the RIBA Sustainable Futures Committee, has designed houses which go a long way to reducing energy needs, but which look far more conventional. As Smith puts it, \u2018ultra low energy homes do not have to wear their environmental credentials on their sleeve\u2019 and may cost little more than, if as much as, a conventional house.3 One of the questions they present is that of density. Can this form of development become a form of mass housing? David Harvey argues that high density urbanised living and \u2018inspired forms of urban design\u2019 are the only paths to a more ecologically sensitive form of living in the twenty first century. For Harvey, in agreement with Castells, the urban and everything that goes into it is as much a part of the solution as it is a contributing factor to ecological difficulties. Cities, he argues, \u2018have always been fundamentally about innovation, wealth creation and wealth consumption and getting things right in cities is the only real path towards technological and economic improvement for the mass of the population\u2019.4 Habraken was arguing forty years ago that \u2018the great problem of society\u2019 was \u2018to find a formula for a housing process which allows comfort and human dignity to exist hand in hand, while maintaining the town as conglomerates of compact building\u2019.139 His proposal for \u2018supports\u2019 was his suggested answer, a proposal which has not, so far as I know, been tried in any extensive way. 1 Hockerton Housing Project Information Pack, Newark, Notts, 1998. 2 J. Ballinger and D. Cassell, \u2018Principl es of energy efficient residential design, in Samuels and Prasad (eds.), Global Warming,, p. 176. 3 R Smith, \u2018Housing: 2016 and Beyond\u2019, paper prepared for \u2018New Homes for Devon conference, Exeter, September 1999. New building materials, like Permanent Insulation Formwork systems, allow a flexible shape, short construction times, and very high insulation capacity. 4 Harvey, Justice, p. 435. 139 Habraken, Supports, p. 54. In terms of sustainability much can be done through the improvement of existing estates through energy saving measures such as introducing solar panels, central heating and extra insulation. In some cases, in cities such as Liverpool and Glasgow, this has made all the difference between the success and failure of large estates, for the reduced costs of alternative energy finally allow the poor to spend money on living, as opposed to existing and struggling simply to meet the bare necessities. The growing appreciation of the need to recycle must also apply to buildings, as it did for earlier generations, so that materials are reused, and usable buildings renovated rather than destroyed. All this, however, hardly amounts to the \u2018inspired forms of urban design\u2019 which Harvey demands. (II) reconciliation: justice and difference Problems of dwelling, says Harries, \u2018are above all not architectural but ethical problems\u2019. We need, he says, an architecture responsive to our essential incompleteness, our need for others, for genuine, concrete community.1 Whilst the need for domestic architecture to respect human integrity, and to allow certain basic standards of privacy, can be overstated, as in \u2018the Englishman\u2019s home is his castle\u2019, for most human beings this is still a utopian aspiration. All housing embodies an anthropology and therefore a view of society. The failure of so much nineteenth and twentieth century housing is demonstrably bound up with the ideology it embodied. As we have seen, Bloch and Hundertwasser are amongst those calling for a new humanism in relation to the built environment. Humanism, it should be clear, is not a monoculture. Turner worked with self build groups in four continents successfully. The challenge is to allow a sympathetic, human scale domestic architecture flourish in relation to the huge varieties of human cultures, intimately related to their climates as they are. The principle underlying organic growth, Day notes, is that the physical form grew out of activities, out of the meeting of users and environment.141 A return to the vernacular would mean as part of the process a recovery of community, re learning the possibilities implicit in shaping our built environment together. Another problem is our technocratic conviction that \u2018anything is possible\u2019. Involved in the new humanism, as Turner implies, must be a fresh recognition of limits. As we have seen, traditional building styles developed by finding solutions to problems that arose through access to 141 Day, Places, p. 95. 1 Harries, Function, p. 363. only a limited range of materials. If we are to rediscover an architecture that is dynamic yet remains authentically traditional, says Simon Fairlie, \u2018then we can only do so by giving builders free rein to solve fundamental problems with a similarly limited, but updated, range of basic local materials\u2019.1 2 The gap which the industrial technocratic society has introduced into the craft tradition is by no means so great as to be unbridgeable and it is therefore entirely possible that something of the diversity of style which has characterised world vernacular can be maintained or recovered the opposite of the one house for all human beings which Le Corbusier proposed, and the opposite of the architectural form of McDonaldisation. If the preservation of difference is an important aspect of justice, as Iris Marion Young has argued, then in terms of the built environment this translates as respect for the vernacular. (Ill) redemption: the importance of in spiration Ruskin argued for providing housing for working people by \u2018the building of more, strongly, beautifully and in groups of limited extent, kept in proportion to their streams and walled round, so that there may be no festering and wretched suburb anywhere, but clean and busy streets within and open country without\u2019.'43 Christopher Day represents a continuation of this tradition, in insisting that aesthetics are not irrelevant to the conditions of social justice. Rows of rectangular buildings, he believes, oppress the freedom of the individual and, we can add, depress the spirit. In his own buildings he tries not to make one window the same as another: The vertebrae of the spine each carry a slightly different load and accept a slightly different movement. They are not identical. Each window likewise has an individual set of requirements to fulfil unless we are just providing containers for people, albeit elaborate ones. It may be ridiculous to make every window different just for the sake of being different, but it is even more so to make every one the same just for the sake of being the same, or to shape them just to impose an elevational pattern.'44 Like Morris, Day emphasises the need to cultivate a sense for beauty, a sense suppressed by technocratic cultures. This sense \u2018used to be so strong that pre industrial common people could not make a spoon, a cart, a boat, even a house look ugly. To do so would have been a crime 143 Cited in Mumford, City, p. 540. 1 Fairlie, Low Impact Development^ pp. 60 1. 2 144 Day, Places, p. 90. against themselves.\u2019 The beauty of ordinary things, he recognises, came from the lived experience of grace: Everything, from reaping the corn to blessing the meal or carving a chair, was an action giving thanks for God\u2019s creation, an artistically satisfying activity. AH they made and did was essentially functional: there was no time, energy or space to make anything without a practical purpose; beauty and utility were inseparable. Today we find the reverse. Beauty and utility are widely regarded as separate streams: we all need utility, but beauty is considered to be an indulgence, peripheral to our main concerns in life.1 Without this attention to the beauty in diversity of the environment we are left with a culture of dependence, seeking escape in one or other form of addiction. Of course our surroundings must satisfy material functions but \u2018to carry architecture beyond the threshold of the materially useful, the biologically supportive or the emotionally satisfying, we need to cultivate and bring together both the inspiration which gives moral force to our ideas and the sense of listening to environment which makes those ideas appropriate\u2019.2\u00ae Some maintain that changing technologies and rising standards of living call in question any simple return to the vernacular but, as Simon Fairlie argues, we need to learn to build with a similarly limited, but updated, range of materials.3 What the new millennium calls for is not the aggressive technocratic imperialism of the twentieth century, but a marriage between new technologies and respect for the past and the regional which will preserve the charm of the world we have inherited. Building for six or nine billion will not make sense without this recovery of the sacred in the broadest sense. This involves the ability of our senses to tell us what is good or bad for us. Polyurethane coated wood, for example, feels hard, smooth and cold and does not breathe. It looks like wood but it is a lie and is bad food for the human spirit. \u2018If you want to bring children up to be honest it is not going to help if their environment is full of lies.\u2019148 Harmony in our surroundings, Day argues, is no mere luxury. Our surroundings are the framework which subtly confine, organise and colour our daily lives. Harmonious surroundings provide support for 1 Ibid., p. 26. 2 U6 Ibid., p. 29. Jeffrey Cook similarly makes a plea for going beyond architecture which is merely benign. \u2018In a global environment that is dramatically deteriorating because of accelerated abuses, an architecture that is only neutral cannot heal the wounds and will not restore the equilibrium of the global natural system.5 He wants an architecture which extends and enriches the natural landscape. \u2018Environmentally benign architecture: beyond passive5, in Samuels and Prasad (eds.), Global Warmings p. 150. 3 Fairlie, Low Impact Development^ p. 61. 148 Day, Places, p. 51. outer social and inner personal harmony. Harmony can be achieved by rules but mies lack life. Or it can arise as an inevitable but life filled consequence of listening conversation.149 That reference to conversation takes us back to the dialogue both Day and Harries ask for between high and low traditions. In the world of casino capitalism whilst buying an old property is often a status symbol, new palaces are still being created, embodying all the gadgetry of Information Technology. In relation to that we face yet another conundrum. There is no doubt at all that the biblical emphasis is on the stakeholder economy, seeing \u2018every family under its vine and fig tree\u2019. Furthermore, the demand for participatory building takes us back to Blake\u2019s citation of Numbers, \u2018Would that all the Lord\u2019s people were prophets.\u2019 Homes for nine billion can only possibly be provided when this is the priority. On the other hand some, though by no means all, of those great houses which we wander around \u2018guide book in hand\u2019 are undeniably beautiful and do express a vision of grace filled life which we cannot but honour. And this, of course, is a standard argument for a class society: the rich function as patrons of the arts and lead the way in architecture. To set against this we have the example of classical Athens, where the entire population lived in extremely modest dwellings, but produced the Parthenon for their communal worship. Perhaps the same might be said for medieval Norwich or even Paris. It is true that \u2018surplus\u2019 is needed to provide the freedom for great architecture to which not all can aspire. In the first chapter I mentioned Karsten Harries\u2019 \u2018ellipse\u2019 between domestic and religious building. Have we reached the stage, he asks, where the ellipse becomes a circle, centred on the house and the individual rather than on God or community?150 Simply to raise the question is to answer it, and to see the point of his remark that the \u2018pedigreed\u2019 tradition takes us out of the everyday and sends us back to it with fresh eyes. Countries where the vernacular is still a cultural dominant, like Norway, show that the vernacular can be insipid, and the pedigreed house can provide excitement and refreshment. But pedigreed buildings which focus the community\u2019s values are one thing. Those which simply make status claims for the rich are quite another. What we certainly do not need is a situation where the vast majority including the world\u2019s burgeoning middle class are condemned to live in soul deadening and unimaginative buildings. Human beings are spiritual creatures. The DIY movement one of the biggest money spinners in the European economy is a testimony to the need people feel to shape their own environment. Unfortunately, as our Northern rubbish tips show, this often involves the superimposition of mass produced \u2018trim\u2019. In building as in every other area in life we get nowhere without education a process by no means to be identified, of course, with what happens in school and university. All the Lord\u2019s people need to be prophets in the shaping of their dwellings from the ground up. We need a new vernacular. But this requires, in turn, education and spiritual discipline if Jane Jacobs\u2019 \u2018great blight of dullness\u2019 is to be replaced. And this is an agenda we have scarcely begun to face. From Eden to Jerusalem: town and country in the economy of redemption Then Jesus went about ah the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom... (Matthew 9.35) \u2018God became human\u2019, said Luther, \u2018that from proud and inhuman gods he might make real human beings.\u2019 Since this refashioning is of flesh and blood the physical environment in which people live, and which also shapes them, is part of the story, part of the economy of redemption. In speaking of the \u2018economy of redemption\u2019 I am alluding to the suggestion of Irenaeus of Lyons, in the late second century, that rather than think in a sin fall redemption pattern we might rather think of redemption as a process. Human beings were made in God\u2019s image, he argued, but had to grow into God\u2019s likeness, a process in which they were nurtured by God the Spirit. Through obedience and discipline and training human beings, who are contingent and created, grow into the image and likeness of the eternal God. This process the Father approves and commands; the Son carries out the Father\u2019s plan; the Spirit supports and hastens the process: while humankind gradually advances and mounts towards perfection; that is, they approach the eternal.1 Note that Irenaeus\u2019 account of redemption is Trinitarian. He describes Christ and the Spirit as the \u2018two hands of God\u2019 through whom the process of redemption is effected. We only have his work because of the urgent need to counter the Gnostics, heretical groups who denied the goodness of the body. By contrast Irenaeus affirms it, above all through his understanding of the incarnation, and the role Christ plays in human history. In affirming the body Irenaeus affirms the built environment, because bodies need buildings. People ensoul places, I have argued, in relation to the house. Better, the Spirit of God in forms and in spires the built environment through people. This is an extension of our existence as Adversus Haereses 4.38.2 soul and body grounded, constituted and maintained by the Spirit of God. Humankind are, in Karl Barth\u2019s formula, bodily soul and besouled body. \u2018Soul would not be soul, if it were not bodily; and body would not be body, if it were not besouled.\u20191 2 The built environment is an extension of this truth. But what form of the built environment? Once humankind moves beyond the hunter gatherer stage, options for living seem to be limited. There are isolated dwellings, hamlets, villages, towns, suburbs and cities. Are all these equally adapted to the purposes of redemption? Does it matter in what kind of physical situation we live? \u2018We shape our buildings and then our buildings shape us,\u2019 said Churchill, famously, of the House of Commons, but the same is true of our larger communities. At least from the time of the emergence of the Greek polls in the sixth century bc people have suggested that either the city or the country is the environment best adapted for humanisation. In the West there is a deep seated prejudice which tells us that we are nearer to God in the country than in the town. In this chapter it is this prejudice I want to examine. THE CONTRAST OF TOWN AND COUNTRY To begin with we can note a peculiarity of the English language, which distinguishes, in a way other European languages do not, between \u2018towns\u2019 and \u2018cities\u2019. \u2018 Die Stadf in German is any town or city; Assisi is a \u2018 citta \u2019 as much as Milan or Rome; Madrid is a ciudad as well as Compostella. But in English London, Edinburgh and Chicago are cities', Ashburton, Crieff or Desmoynes are towns? Much anti urban literature opposes the countryside to the city. There is, however, a worthwhile distinction between towns and cities, which I shall highlight in this chapter, turning to the city proper in the next. Thomas Sharp, for example, a leading town planner in Britain between the 1930s and the 1950s, hated the industrial cities, which he described as \u2018sordid and ugly\u2019, and cursed \u2018the blind callousness\u2019 of the men who created them. He loved the country towns, and envisaged a future of compact towns which preserved their virtues. In this he seems to have been a precursor of compact city theory: \u2018Surely the ideal town is one which is as compact as the minimum requirements of public health will allow.\u20193 1 K. Barth, Church Dogmatics III/2 (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, i960), p. 350. 2 Tamil has a similar distinction to English. Villages and towns are oor; cities are naharam. 3 T. Sharp, Town and Countryside (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1932), p. 149. The contrast between town and country emerged quite early. Simon Schama claims that classical civilisation always defined itself against the primeval woods, from the epic of Gilgamesh onwards.1 In Scripture \u2018the city was found too problematic to serve as a viable model for human communities. The image of the garden suggested a setting more conducive to moral conduct and livelihood. The good and godly life was down on the farm, not in the tumult of the city.\u20192 \u2018The antagonism between town and country begins with the transition from barbarism to civilization, from tribe to state, from locality to nation, and runs through the whole history of civilization to the present day,\u2019 wrote Marx.3 As a matter of fact it was rather muted in medieval Europe but as the vigour of towns and cities grew, so it became stronger. It is fundamental to Shakespeare\u2019s comedies, for instance, with their ironic contrasts between court and shepherd\u2019s cot, and was a dominant theme of the early Enlightenment. Understanding it as a form of class struggle the early Soviet state sought to abolish the town and country distinction either by locating people in self contained urban centres, the urbanist solution, or by dispersing the population throughout the country and producing a townless society, as the de urbanists wanted.4 Neither policy was carried through coherendy, and the distinction remains. There are two major strands to it. One of these is aesthetic. Near the beginning of the automobile era, before car ownership had become anything like general, Thomas Sharp provided one of the most splendidly polemical accounts of the relation of town and country in the twentieth century, like Frank Lloyd Wright anticipating what the implications of universal car ownership might be but drawing very different conclusions. \u2018Tradition has broken down. Taste is utterly debased,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018There is no enlightened guidance or correction from authority.\u2019 The town, long since degraded, is now being annihilated by a flabby, shoddy, romantic nature worship. That romantic nature worship is destroying also the object of its adoration, the countryside. Both are being destroyed. The one agelong certainty, the antithesis of town and country, is already breaking down. Two diametrically opposed, dramatically contrasting, inevitable types ofbeauty are being displaced by one drab, revolting neutrality. Rural influences neutralize the town. Urban influences neutralize the country. In a few years all will be neutrality. The strong, masculine virility of the town; the softer beauty, the 1 S. Schama, Landscape and Memory (London: Fontana, 1996), p. 82. 2 W. P. Brown and J. T. Carroll, \u2018The Garden and the Plaza1, Interpretation 54/1 (January 2000) p. 6. 3 K. Marx,German Ideology, in Collected Works, vol. v (Moscow: Progress, 1976), p. 64. 4 J. H. Bater, The Soviet City (London: Arnold, 1980), p. 23. richness, the fruitfulness of that mother of men, the countryside, will be debased into one sterile, hermaphroditic beastliness.1 Sharp\u2019s appeal is both ad hominem and aesthetic. \u2018Surely\u2019 it goes without saying that the preservation of the antithesis is desirable in itself. Town and country represent two pure and separate forms, each capable of supreme beauty, each serving two instinctive human desires, each contrasting with, offsetting, and supplementing the other.2 Sharp was followed in this approach after the Second World War by Ian Nairn, in a column called \u2018Outrage\u2019 in the Architectural Review. He attacked the \u2018creeping mildew\u2019 of urban sprawl and envisaged that by the millennium Britain would consist of isolated oases of preserved monuments in a desert of wire, concrete roads, cosy plots and bungalows, with no distinction between town and country. Today the philosopher Roger Scruton deplores the destruction of both towns and countryside in Britain by planning laws which allow out of town building sites using alien building types.3 The major contrast, however, is moral. Mumford finds a reaction to the city as early as the \u2018axial shift\u2019 of the sixth century bc when: To achieve a new life, the holders of the new vision must desert the city: they must either establish themselves in the rural hinterland, in lonely forest or hillside cave, or at least on the outskirts of the city, in gymnasia or in garden colonies... If they enter the city, they must form a secret society and go underground, in order to survive.4 The contrast of corrupt town versus virtuous countryside became a conventional topos of Western thought. It was this, in fact, which inspired Cowper\u2019s famous line \u2018God made the country, and man made the town\u2019. The love of Nature and the scenes she draws Is nature\u2019s dictate... Lovely indeed the mimic works of art; But Nature\u2019s works far lovelier... Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast; \u2019Tis free to all \u2019tis every day renewed; Who scorns it starves deservedly at home. 1 Sharp, Town and Countryside, p. n. 2 Ibid., p. 43. 2 11 R. Scruton, \u2018Gold Comfort Towns\u2019, The Times, 30 January 1999. His account of the charms of nineteenth century Swindon makes an ironic contrast with Ruskin\u2019s damning of the very same place on account of its dreadful railway architecture. Nairne too blamed the planners who in his 3 view were responsible for what he called subtopia (suburb + utopia) because of their adherence to a policy of low density dispersal, and he believed this would impact on people\u2019s critical faculties to produce \u2018subtopians\u2019. 4 L. Mumford, The City inHistory (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p 236. In cities, by contrast, Rank abundance breeds... sloth and lust, And wantoness and gluttoness excess. In cities vice is hidden with most ease, Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there Beyond the achievement of successful flight.13 Flight, of course, might not have been so successful because, as Keith Thomas notes, in early modern Britain, \u2018agriculture was the most ruthlessly developed sector of the economy, small husbandmen were declining in number, wage labour was universal, and the vices of avarice, oppression and hypocrisy were at least as prominent in the countryside as in the town\u2019.14 The idyllisation of country life which we find in Gowper stands in a long tradition which looks backwards or forwards to a past or a coming golden age, a process which begins with Theocritus and Greek pastoral in the third century BC.15 From Horace onwards, writes Raymond Williams, \u2018much country pastoral only served to obscure the real nature of relations in the countryside, to promote superficial comparisons between town and country, and to prevent real ones\u2019.'6 But very often pastoral had what theologians would call an eschatological dimension. Thus Virgil dreams of the golden age when the earth will produce its own fruit, and no creature prey on another: Goats shall walk home, their udders taut with milk, and nobody Herding them; the ox will have no fear of the lion... The soil will need no harrowing, the vine no pruning knife... (Eclogue IV) This inevitably recalls the words of Isaiah four hundred years earlier: The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fading together, and a little child shall lead them. (Isa. 11.6) This pastoral eschatology, if we can call it that, fed anti city sentiment. 13 W. Cowper, The Sofa, Cowpefs Poetical Works (Edinburgh: Gall &amp; Inglis, 1853), p. 116. 14 K. Thomas, Man and the Natural World (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984), p. 246. 15 Vance points out that words we use to compliment the countryside (arcadian, idyllic) tend to be Greek and words which insult are Latin derivatives (rustic, villainous, savage, bucolic, rural). Only \u2018pastoral5 is complimentary. Latin urban references are complimentary (courtly, courteous, urbane, civilised, citizen). J. E. Vance, Jnr, The Continuing City (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), p. 76. 16 R. Williams, The Country and the City (London: Hogarth, 1985), p. 54. Pastoral takes a new turn in the seventeenth century with the view that in the countryside we are closer to God, and that to live in the country is, as it were, to dwell once more in Eden. A particular form of natural theology encouraged this view, contrasting what was \u2018man made\u2019 with what was \u2018natural\u2019. Those who are conversant in the fields and woods, said Thomas Jackson in 1625, \u2018continually contemplate the works of God\u2019.1 When surrounded by sea or mountains, said Burnet in 1684, \u2018 [w] e do naturally upon such occasions think of God and his greatness, and whatsoever hath but shadow and appearance of Infinite, as all things have that are too big for our comprehension, they fill and over bear the mind with their Excess, and cast it into a pleasing kind of stupor and admiration\u2019.2 It is ironic that this view is found amongst Reformed divines, for, Brown and Carroll notwithstanding, it cannot really appeal to Scripture.19 The Bible begins in a garden but ends in a city. Eden is not so much the site of primitive innocence as of temptation and fall, and the new creation will take the form of a city. Its historical narrative begins with nomadic pastoralists looking for somewhere to settle, and ends in imperial Rome, the world\u2019s first truly great city. Much of its focus is on Jerusalem, the centre of the eschatological hopes of the Isaianic community. Suspicion of the town seems to be implied in the gospels, where Jesus prefers the village and tells his disciples that his mission is not to preach in the city. Ghed Myers suggests that hostility to Jesus\u2019 radical social practice was centred in urban areas, where the symbolic order was concentrated. This may have been the experience of Mark\u2019s community, which probably shared the general rural suspicion of Hellenistic urbanisation threatening Palestinian village life.20 Paul, on the other hand, is one of the best known \u2018city men\u2019 of antiquity, and Christianity in the first two centuries seems to have been largely urban. Attitudes to town and country, then, are rather evenly balanced and, even allowing for Isaiah 11, there is not really a scriptural form of pastoral. Even the Song of Songs is set in a \u2018city\u2019. The garden of Eden recalls Hesiod\u2019s golden age, except that labour seems to have been required even there, but it is open to question whether it is, as Milton described it, \u2018a happy rural seat of various view\u2019. True, expulsion from the garden is followed by the founding of the city by the first fratricide, Cain, but the urban/rural antithesis is never developed. In truth there is less scriptural warrant for Gowper\u2019s line than there is classical. 1 Cited in Thomas, Man, p. 250. 2 G. Burnet, Theory of the Earth (London, 1684), p. 139. 2 19 See footnote 6. 20 C. Myers, Binding the StrongMan (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1988), p. 151. Despite this fact the leading Reformed commentator on the city in the twentieth century, Jacques Ellul, took a profoundly pessimistic view of the town country relationship. Today, he wrote, \u2018the country (and soon this will be true of the immense Asian steppe) is only an annex of the city\u2019.1 The city cannot function except as a parasite. \u2018What the city produces is for her own use. Notwithstanding tractors, electricity, fertilizer, what the city can produce for the country is absurd and ridiculous compared with what she receives. As for her spiritual worth, her ferment of ideas will be of use nowhere but in the city. On the other hand she spoils peasant values with remarkable virtuosity\u2019.2 The city was incapable of any other destiny than that of killing the country, \u2018where God put man to enable him to live his life as best he could\u2019.23 This idea that God intended human beings to live in the country is, as we have seen, quite new, a product of the cult of nature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Keith Thomas traces the origins of the preference for the country at least in part to urban pollution, already a source of complaint in the thirteenth century.24 The coal which was burned in early modern times had at least twice as much sulphur as that used today, and smoke and soot were accordingly a prominent feature of any large town. Provisions for disposing of sewage were rudimentary and plague intermittent. Hardly surprising that those who could afford to should retreat to the country. The prophet Amos already talks of summer houses and winter houses, and the summer house may have been in the country even then. At any rate, this was the case in twelfth century England and the process of cultural seepage saw it become a fashion by the 1670s in London when Pepys records his hunt for a suitable country retreat, finally opting for a time share in Parson\u2019s Green.25 In addition the gentry had their wealth in the land, and reckoned to spend the summer in their country estates, even if they wintered in the city. The coming of full scale industrialisation completed the process. Wordsworth might praise the view from Westminster Bridge, but what the nineteenth century took from him was the religion of nature: And hark! how blithe the throstle sings! He, too, is no mean preacher: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher... 1 J.

One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can.26 Once the working classes had wrested one day a week for leisure the exodus to the \u2018countryside\u2019 was born.27 The moral contrast can, of course, be turned on its head, as the word \u2018civilisation\u2019, what the city or the town can do for us, indicates. From roughly the same period in the sixth century there is a contrast, which was to become conventional, between rustic boorishness and urbanity. In Greek the words asteios (urban) and agroikos (rural) can also be translated as \u2018witty\u2019 and \u2018boorish\u2019, a contrast Richard Sennett derives from the disdain in which the sheer material struggle for existence was held.28 Sydney Smith expresses this townsman\u2019s sneer in his famous description of the country as \u2018a kind of healthy grave\u2019. It finds expression in authors who had no such disdain. \u2018The bourgeoisie\u2019, said Marx and Engels, in the Communist Manifesto, \u2018has subjected the country to the rule of towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life.\u2019 Here is implied a quite other view of redemption. For Cowper and for the pastoral tradition as a whole the only remedy for sin is to flee the city, to take refuge in an ersatz monastery, or what Cowper describes as \u2018the peasant\u2019s nest\u2019, which he shared with Lady Austen. For this tradition, on the other hand, it is only the town which makes humanisation possible. If we take the Irenaean view, and think of redemption as a history which begins in Eden and ends in the establishment of\u2018Jerusalem\u2019 at the second coming, then towns are a key factor in the process. As the two poles of Irenaean thinking suggest, the process must be understood dialectically. THE COUNTRY Thomas Sharp called Cowper\u2019s famous verse \u2018one of the most foolish lines in the whole body of English poetry\u2019, and the reason is obvious. Sharp eulogised the English landscape as \u2018the loveliest, the most 2\u00ae W. Wordsworth, \u2018Expostulation and Reply\u2019 (1798), Complete Works (London: Macmillan, 1900), p. 85. 27 Classically expressed in Ewan MacColl\u2019s song \u2018The Manchester Rambler\u2019, written to support the mass trespass on Kinder Scout, a hill in Britain\u2019s PeakDistrict, in 1932.

Sennett, Flesh and Stone (London: Faber, 1994), p. 36. humanized\u2019 of all.1 The eighteenth century enclosers were amongst his heroes, for the landscape they bequeathed to the 1920s the hedgerows, and rows of poplar, beech and elm. Raymond Williams makes the same point that \u2018the country\u2019 is as much the result of human labour as the town whilst drawing attention to the exploitation and inhumanity this involved: Even if we exdude the wars and brigandage to which it was commonly subject, the unaccountable thousands who grew crops and reared beasts only to be looted and burned and led away with tied wrists, this economy, even at peace, was an order of exploitation of a most thoroughgoing kind: a property in men as well as in land; a reduction of most men to working animals, tied by forced tribute, forced labour, or \u2018bought and sold like beasts\u2019; \u2018protected\u2019 by law and custom only as animals and streams are protected, to yield more labour, more food, more blood, an economy directed, in all its working relations, to a physical and economic domination of a significantly total kind.2 The point is well taken from both. \u2018The country\u2019 is no more \u2018natural\u2019 than the town. The term \u2018countryside\u2019 was, Raymond Williams tells us, originally a Scots term to describe a specific locality, and applied to rural life as a whole only in the nineteenth century.3 In a study of the Cumbrian village of Gosforth W. Williams contrasted \u2018the countryside\u2019 not with the town but with the village.4 The former meant remote farms, where social patterns were quite different to those in the village. By the end of the twentieth century \u2018the countryside\u2019 meant partly a vanishing, if not altogether vanished, way of life, but much more the location for wealthy \u2018quality of lifers\u2019 who could, for the first time in history, easily combine the advantages of both town and country because they could afford to live at a distance from the town and travel to work and places of entertainment. Both town and country need careful definition. \u2018People have often said \u201cthe city\u201d when they have meant capitalism or bureaucracy or centralised power, while \u201cthe country\u201d... has at times meant everything from independence to deprivation... At every point we need to put these ideas to the historical realities: at times to be confirmed, at times denied.\u20195 1 Sharp, Town and Countryside, pp. 15, 16. 2 Williams, Country, pp. 37\u20148. 2 31 R.

Jackson says it originated in France, and came into English in the thirteenth century to indicate the territory of a community speaking the same dialect and engaged in the same kind of farming under the same lord.

Complete self sufficiency is possible only where people are content with a very low standard of living. Hunter gatherer societies can only sustain ten people per square mile, and settled agriculture is therefore the prerequisite for the growth of larger communities. The ancient norm of such communities is the village. Hamlets or isolated farms, which tend to predominate in hill country, and also wooded country, or where a shallow well will tap water, all relate to villages or towns to survive. Where deep wells are needed one finds large villages on the streams or where springs break out. Beyond these physical criteria we gather in communities because physically we cannot manage on our own, and because of the desire for fellowship and protection, a major consideration for most of human history. Most human beings since the dawn of historical time have lived in villages, and it is fair to say, therefore, that the village is mother to the human race: only at the very end of the twentieth century did more people live in cities than in villages. As late as 1871 more than half the population of Britain, at that time the world\u2019s most industrialised nation, lived in villages or in towns of less than 20,000, and even today, in the world\u2019s two most populous countries, India and China, the majority of the population still do. The Scott Report into the village community published in Great Britain in 1942 defined a village as any community with a population with less than 1500, whilst the French census still fixes the number at 2000. These figures are, however, arbitrary. As Braudel points out, there are Russian villages much larger than this which still cannot be counted towns, and before 1500 ad the vast majority of towns in the West had fewer than 2000 inhabitants.1 A. W. Ashby defined a village as \u2018a collection of houses, larger than a hamlet, in a country district, usually an ancient district, containing a church, with one or more service institutions such as a school or shop, and forming the residential nucleus of the parish\u2019. A hamlet, on the other hand, he calls \u2018a small group of houses in a country district, containing only a small proportion of the local population, and meagrely supplied, if at all, with service institutions\u2019.2 1 F. Braudel, The Structures of Everyday Life (Glasgow: Collins, 1981), p. 485. 2 In an article in Country Towns in the Future England, written in 1944. Cited in W. Baker, The English Village (London: Oxford University Press, 1953), p. II. Flora Thompson contrasts village and hamlet in terms of greater social complexity as well as size. \u2018The village was a little world in itself; the hamlet was but a segment\u2019 (Lark Rise to Candleford (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1954), p. 472). According to Vance, \u2018Villages were a form of rural settlement brought about at least in part by the need for defence at a time when the Pax Romana no longer stretched across the land. These clusters of dwellings had nothing to do with the execution of urban functions, and Though perhaps adequate for England this would not do for, say, India, where a great many villages lack service institutions, but are too large to be ranked as hamlets. The Scott Report classified villages according to material structure, layout, plan and economic purpose.3\u00ae There were and are, of course, not simply rural, but a great many fishing, mining, quarrying or mill villages, grouped around one industry. But even rural villages were never completely non industrial, at least before the end of the twentieth century. Blacksmiths and wheelwrights were found in villages, alongside shoemakers, tailors, hedgers, thatchers, sawyers, sadlers, stonemasons, millers, bakers, brewers, mole and rat catchers, quite apart from \u2018the common labourer\u2019 and the women who spun wool and wove it. The coming of mass production and mechanised agriculture destroyed many of these trades. But although size, and the ability of the community to provide for itself to some extent, is an important part of the definition of a village it misses the real heart of it. Thomas Hardy observed in Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilks that \u2018[e]very village has its idiosyncracy, its constitution, often its own code of morality\u2019. Nigel Rapport has glossed this observation at length, in a very postmodern way, challenging the idea that the village is socially and culturally homogenous. He argues that we cannot take analytical categories such as \u2018rural\u2019, \u2018community\u2019, \u2018kinship\u2019, \u2018class\u2019 or \u2018social structure\u2019 for granted. Any one behavioural form can, in specific situations, have a number of different meanings. \u2018They become instruments of diversity and difference, and yet the conditions of their use remain essentially public, and it is in coordination with significant others and in certain routine and limited ways that these meanings come to be made.\u201937 His main informants appeared as \u2018aggregations of idiosyncra cies, whose most vibrant and significant communities were ultimately, perhaps, private to themselves\u2019.38 This emphasis on difference is doubtless overstated, for if his observations are pushed we cease to be able to talk of local cultures at all, and that seems to be empirically false, but it is a useful caution against over hasty generalisations. the traditional concept of classical geography that the village grows to the town and the town in turn to the city is little supported by either history or logic. Villages remain villages, for the most part, and towns begin as towns\u2019 ( Continuing City, p. 102). 3 6 Report of tiie Committee on Land Utilization in Rural Areas (London: HMSO, 1942). By \u2018layout\u2019 it meant whether they were nucleated or scattered, and by plan it meant whether they were formally planned or \u2018organic\u2019. For this distinction see chapter 8. 37 N. Rapport, Diverse World Views in an English Village (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1993). P ! 7 0 What most people in Britain mean by a village is a product of the genre of\u2018country writing\u2019, which begins with Walton\u2019s Compleat Angler, and includes the work of Richard Jefferies, Flora Thompson, but also Laurie Lee. Lee memorably described the end of the ancient village: The last days of my childhood were also the last days of the village. I belonged to that generation which saw, by chance, the end ofa thousand years\u2019 life... Myself, my family, my generation, were born in a world of silence; a world of hard work and necessary patience... of villages like ships in the empty landscapes and the long walking distances between them; of white narrow roads, ratted by hooves and cartwheels, innocent of oil or petrol, down which people passed rarely and almost never for pleasure... Time squared itself, and the village shrank, and distances crept nearer... The horses had died; few people kept pigs any more but spent their spare time buried in engines. The flutes and cornets, the gramophones with horns, the wind harps were thrown away now wireless aerials searched the electric sky for the music of the Savoy Orpheans.1 The immense success of this book and others in the genre speak of the nostalgia of post industrial human beings for a more stable and more beautiful past.2 Lee is honest enough about Sladd, but it is as well to remind ourselves what the reality of village life in Britain meant in the decade before the First World War. Recalling a childhood spent in the village in the 1870s the liberal MP E. N. Bennett remembered the dull scenery the slush and mud of the roads, the absolutely mechanical existence ofthe villagers, who went to bed at eight o\u2019clock to save oil and candles, the careworn faces of the women, the sullen endurance of their husbands, the dreary respectability of the farmers... There is so little to refine the mind or cheer the soul in rural England.3 The toil has gone, but rural deprivation has not. The widespread failure to recognise it stems from \u2018the perceived compensations which are a vital construction of rural living. The poor can be disregarded as being \u201ccontent\u201d with their rural life and the not so poor will not be able to reconcile the idea of poverty with the idyll ised imagined geographies 1 L. Lee, Cider with Rosie (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1962), pp. 216, 230. 2 Georgina Boyes has demonstrated the way in which an idyllicised countryside was used for propaganda purposes during World War II. \u2018 \u201cA country lane\u201d, \u201ca cottage small beside a field of grain\u201d were... presented as Englishness itself... \u201cThe Southcountry\u201d, its rolling hills and village greens reflecting priorities set by nature rather than current events, offered a timeless and indestructible conceptual retreat to those whose uncertain present was bombing raids, the rubble of destroyed cities, factory production lines and foreign battlefields.\u2019 The Imagined Village (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), p. 181. The evacuation of inner city children to the countryside, and the emphasis on farming as part ofthe war effort, brought city and country together for a short time. 3 E. N. Bennett, Problems of Village Life (London: Williams and Norgate, 1914), p. 78. of the village\u2019. In fact in Britain some 20 per cent or more of rural households live in or close to poverty.1 If we turn to the Third World, four fifths of those classified by the UN as living in \u2018absolute poverty\u2019 live in villages, and it is this which drives urban migration as it did in many parts of Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the late twentieth century, at least in Britain, villages changed again under the impact of \u2018counter urbanisation\u2019, the drift away from the cities back to the countryside made possible by the motor car and increasingly available means of world wide communication. If the nineteenth century was characterised by a tidal wave of people flooding into the cities, in the twentieth century the tide went the other way, in the North at any rate, first into the suburbs and then into the countryside beyond. \u2018Planned or unplanned, promoted or discouraged, people continue to quit the centre for the suburb, the suburb for the countryside.\u20192 In Britain the move away from larger conurbations doubled between 1961 and 1981 and rural areas have had the highest population growth of any category. There have been population increases of one third in towns with as few as 5000 residents. Those who make this move hope to enjoy the advantages of an urban life without its major stresses.3 Drawing deeply on the jargon of postmodernity Keith Halfacree explores the ways in which this move can be considered either a postmodern celebration, a piece of reaction, or a realistic and sensible option.4 He argues that it can be understood either as a reaction against the tyranny of urban rationalism, or a strategy to deny postmodern complexity and to find a world in which \u2018eternal truths\u2019 are created and sustained. Those who return to rural life are seeking guidance from traditional roots and values. Instead of seeing the desire for openness, quietness, cleanliness, aesthetic quality and nature... as reflecting a postmodern concern with style or premodern concern with the past we can see it as an attempt to create a \u2018distance\u2019 between the migrant and the rest of the world, as symbolised by the urban population, in order to overcome the dedifferentiating tendencies of postmodernism.5 1 P.

Somewhat implausibly, in my view, the desire for a residential escape, a slower pace of life, a sense of community, safety and familiarity are linked to a need to obtain a sense of belonging in the world as it is today rather than to achieve a return to a past world or to play games of country living. The problem with such a positive reading is that this kind of \u2018residential escape\u2019 is only possible for those with money, and is the reverse side of the rural deprivation already mentioned. \u2018The countryside\u2019 has become a retreat for those who can afford 4x4 vehicles and barn conversions, an updated and extended version of the country house of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. What replaces the gamekeepers and the mantraps is political nimbyism, the determination to keep middle class quality of life at all costs, and a savage attack on those who threaten to spoil it, from New Age travellers to gypsies. In effect this is countryside as theme park, a version of the class war, with little regard for the countryside as the place where food for the cities is grown and pastured. In a study of the \u2018geography of exclusion\u2019 David Sibley correctly sees that what is at issue here is the assumption that the countryside belongs to the privileged.1 When the colonisation of the countryside by urban incomers is added to the impact of industrialised agriculture, with its high tech machinery and huge concrete hangars, then the result is that it is turned into \u2018a cross between a factory and a drive in museum\u2019.2 The agonised debate around the countryside in Britain during the Foot and Mouth crisis of 2 001 thought of the countryside primarily as a leisure resource, an \u2018amenity\u2019. Journalists and politicians were united in the view that \u2018food security\u2019 was a dead issue. No longer a factory, then, but a vast park, with farmers as curators. It is, of course, perfectly clear that such views are impossible without the supermarket. The new appropriation of the countryside is defined by the out of town shopping centre. THE TOWN As M. O. H. Carver has argued in a brilliant paper, a town is a conversation in matter: Towns can be flagship of empire, residence of authority, popular theme park, an ideological idol, a shopping machine, a manufacturer\u2019s ghetto. These numerous definitions are not the result of failing to find a clear philosophical position to 1 D. Sibley, Geographies of Exclusion (London: Routledge, 1995), p. 107. He cites the speech of John Major at the Tory Party Conference in 1992 attacking New Age Travellers, and shows that the rhetoric of the \u2018countryside\u2019 lobby is \u2018by definition exclusionary\u2019. 2 S. Fairlie, Low Impact Development (Charlbury: Jon Carpenter, 1996), p. xi. express the entity. There is no entity. The idea of the town was never agreed; on the contrary it was a source of permanent contention, a long argument preserved in stone and timber constructions.1 2 3 Whilst it is true that the idea of the town was never agreed, the claim that \u2018there is no entity\u2019 is probably too strong. In the first place, towns have always existed in relation to their surrounding regions. The town, says Braudel, only exists in relation to a form of life lower than its own. There are no exceptions to this rale. No privilege serves as a substitute. There is no town, no townlet without its villages, its scrap of rural life attached; no town that does not supply its hinterland with the amenities of the market; the use of its shops, its weights and measures, its moneylenders, its lawyers, even its distractions. It has to dominate an empire, however tiny, in order to exist.5\u201c In the Hebrew bible villages are called, delightfully, the \u2018daughters\u2019 of their cities. The relationship between town and village was never one way, however. Before the twentieth century towns had scarcely any excess of births over deaths and so recruitment from surrounding regions was necessary. It has been calculated that in the eleventh century a town of 3000 inhabitants needed the land of ten villages in order to live.5' Prior to the twentieth century towns could be fed by large scale trade only partially and in rare circumstances, and most towns lived symbiotically with their surrounding countryside. At harvest time artisans and others left their houses and trades behind them and went to work in the fields. This continued in the Scottish city of Dundee, for example, right into the nineteen sixties.4 Town and countryside \u2018obeyed the rule of \u201creciprocity of perspectives\u201d: mutual creation, mutual domination, mutual exploitation according to the unchanging rules of co existence... the towns urbanized their countryside, but the countryside \u201cruralized\u201d the towns too\u2019, as urban fortunes were spent on land.5 As with villages we can define a town partly in terms of minimum size. Waller suggests 10,000 for a town, 50,000 for a large town and 100,000 for a city.6 7 However, the existence of extensive villages which never become a town make this inadequate. Aristotle\u2019s polis is both city and state, and yet it was certainly smaller than most modern towns. 1 M. O. H. Carver, Arguments in Stone: Archaeological Research and the European Town in the First Millennium, (Oxford: Oxbow, 1993), pp. 4 5. 2 Braudel, Structures, p. 481. 51 This is the calculation ofW. Abel, cited in ibid., p. 486. 3 52 Until then the school holidays were fixed for the \u2018tatty picking5 (the potato harvest), in which 4 children had to play their part. 5 Braudel, Structures, p. 486. 6 P. J. Waller, Town, City and Nation: England 1850 1914 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 7 1983), p. 6. There is also a clear and important distinction between a town and a city. Stoke was designated a city in 1925 but remains a town in popular consciousness, part of the Potteries which are a \u2018region without a city\u2019.1 In Britain we have \u2018county towns\u2019, \u2018market towns\u2019 and \u2018cathedral cities\u2019 which resemble each other more than they do the great industrial cities. In America there are the great cities but also \u2018small town America\u2019. The distinction was made in Rome between the simple municipium and the civitas, which was a self governing community. The Anglo Saxon burgh, which had its own charter, did not, however, necessarily become a city. Though size is clearly a key part of the definition, the question of diversity of function is more so. The town has historically provided a centre of trade, recreation, defence, religion and administration. In the town the division of labour is greater than in the village. \u2018Towns are hosts to industry... In the medieval town more than a hundred different trades are known from documentary evidence.\u20192 Perhaps this is the root meaning of the Hebrew ir, city, meaning place of stir. Because of the division of labour people have to obtain their food in the market. This means that the town \u2018generalizes the market into a widespread phenomenon\u2019.3 It was the development of the market town which meant the end of the feudal manor, its predecessor as a distribution centre. \u2018Every town, wherever it may be, must primarily be a market. Without a market, a town is inconceivable.\u201958 Towns provided protection : the Greek word polis may come from a root meaning \u2018to fill\u2019, hence a filled in wall serving as a fortress. In most countries until the twentieth century towns might be expected to have gates and walls. Britain was an exception, though even here every ancient town has its echoes of the old gates. Not only that, but the need to organise a larger mass of people meant that a structure of internal power w as essential, city councils and their agents. Towns also provide amenities which are, says Carver, \u2018among their most robust and enduring properties\u2019. All towns are shaped by the dominant mode of transport. When the horse was the normal means of traction regular stopping points were needed and the old A roads of England are punctuated by coaching inns at approximately twenty five miles\u2019 distance from each other, the distance a horse could be expected to cover in a day.59 The importance of the old market town in turn dwindled with changing transportation patterns. Waller instances the ancient town of Wallingford, marooned by the change in line of the London to Gloucester road in the late 5 ? Braudel, Structures, p. 481. 55 Ibid., p. 76. 58 Ibid., p. 501. 1 2 Carver, Arguments in Stone, p. 3. 3 59 Ibid., p. 504. seventeenth century.60 At the end of the twentieth century, however, the country town is once again experiencing a revival. It is now perceived to offer a quality of living able to satisfy a wide range of interests, material and cultural. \u2018The overall result is that in the shires of central and southern England there are hundreds of small but expanding villages, towns and cities, served by a comprehensive system of motorways and inter city railways, easily accessible to airfields and ferry terminals, developing their own cultural life and together comprising a market of over 18 million people.\u20196' For Braudel, towns are \u2018so many electric transformers. They increase tension, accelerate the rhythm of exchange and ceaselessly stir up men\u2019s lives.\u20196'2 This is true of all towns he reviews Asian, Russian and Muslim towns in his survey. But the European towns which developed after the eleventh century differed from others. Alongside the contest between town and the country, there is also a contest between the city and the state. Normally the state won. \u2018The miracle of the first great urban centuries in Europe was that the city won hands down, at least in Italy, Flanders and Germany. It was able to try the experiment of leading a completely separate life for quite a long time. This was a colossal event.\u201963 It meant that these autonomous towns were marked by an \u2018unparalleled freedom\u2019. They organised taxation, finances, public credit and customs and excise; invented public loans; organised industry and the crafts; reinvented long distance trade, bills of exchange, and the first forms of trading companies and accountancy. They also set in motion class struggles.\u00ae4 Though parasitic on the countryside towns embodied intelligence, risk, progress and modernity. They were \u2018the accelerators of historical time\u2019. Towns, cities, are turning points, watersheds of human history. When they first appeared, bringing with them the written word, they opened the door to what we now call history. Their revival in Europe in the eleventh century marked the beginning of the continent\u2019s rise to eminence... All major bursts of growth are expressed by an urban explosion.65 Here is as strong an expression as we are likely to find of what I called earlier the Irenaean idea of redemption. Following Braudel, you might say, \u2018No wonder Isaiah, Ezekiel and the author of Revelation all depict the end time in terms of a city, for it is cities which have been the driving \u00ae\u00b0 Waller, Town, p. 6. 61 R. Green, \u2018Not Compact Cities but Sustainable Regions\u2019, in M. Jenks, E. Burton and K. Williams (eds.), The Compact City: A Sustainable Urban Form? (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 146. 62 Braudel, Structures, p. 479. 63 Ibid., p. 511. 64 Ibid., p. 512. 63 Ibid., p. 479. force of history.\u2019 Of course, as soon as it is put like that doubts set in, and the difficulty of ascribing historical causality to social change precludes such a simple explanation. Let us allow their importance, and their indispensable role, but at best, in the whole history of human development, they can only be one factor amongst many. Nevertheless, we have to allow that they do play a very different role in the economy of redemption to villages, and a crucial and creative one at that. HERMAPHRODITIC LIVING What Sharp called \u2018hermaphroditic living\u2019 is not an invention of the twentieth century. As we have seen, in earlier ages there was always some osmosis between country and town, and \u2018innumerable small towns could barely be distinguished from country life\u2019.1 Rodney Hilton argues that in feudal society the basic conflicts were within town and country, not between them. Social and economic links require that they be seen as inseparable parts of the same society. In his view medieval towns should not be regarded as a radically progressive force helping to transform an economically and socially backward countryside.\u00ae2 And Raymond Williams adds that, to the contrary, the accumulation of power by the city led to a situation in which the country as a whole was exploited by the city as a whole.3 What Sharp opposed, however, was a genuinely new genre which did indeed seek to marry town and country. Sharp\u2019s b\u00eate noire, the Garden City, represented a reaction to the industrial city, where this relation had broken down. In the famous diagram of Cities of Tomorrow Howard outlined a town magnet and a country magnet, the one representing prospects of advancement, social opportunity, and places of amusement, the other beauty, fresh air, and sounds of rippling water. He gave to these a theological gloss, seeing the town as the symbol of society (human work) and the country as the symbol of God\u2019s love and care. Neither of these represents \u2018the full plan and purpose of nature\u2019. \u2018Human society and the beauty of nature are meant to be enjoyed together. The two magnets must be made one.\u2019 His proposal was a new kind of unit, the Garden City, whose organic pattern would in the end spread from the individual model to a whole constellation of similar cities.69 Mumford 1 Ibid., p. 487. 2 R. Hilton, \u2018Towns in English Medieval Society\u2019, in R. Holt and G. Rosser (eds.), The English Medieval Town: A Reader in English Urban History 1200 1540 (London: Longman, 1990), p. 28. 3 Williams, Country, pp. 51, 54. 69 Mumford, City, p. 591. was an advocate of Garden Cities on the grounds that they sought to restore human scale to the city, setting natural limits to growth.1 Howard, he thought, brought the city \u2018the essential biological criteria of dynamic equilibrium and organic balance: balance as between city and country in a larger ecological pattern, and balance between the varied functions of the city\u2019.2 What Howard called the \u2018town cluster\u2019, set in a permanent green matrix to form a new ecological and political unit, was in fact \u2018the embryonic form of a new type of city that would transcend the spatial limitations of the historic city\u2019.3 Sharp loathed this vision, reading it as a version of the \u2018back to Nature\u2019 movement. Howard does not remember that in marriage the separate married identities remain with their special distinguishing characteristics unaltered: they do not merge into one common form half way between their two differing forms: nor do the fruits of their marriage display that new form half way between theirs... Howard\u2019s new hope, new life, new civilization, Town Country, is a hermaphrodite; sterile, imbecile, a monster; abhorrent and loathsome to the Nature which he worships.4 Jane Jacobs was another ferocious opponent. Howard\u2019s aim, she said, \u2018was the creation of self sufficient small towns, really very nice towns if you were docile and had no plans of your own and did not mind spending your life among others with no plans of their own. As in all Utopias, the right to have plans of any significance belonged only to the planners in charge.\u201974 Tacitly she is echoing Braudel\u2019s view of the towns as active and creative. The Garden City, a sleepy dormitory, is \u2018docile\u2019, only fit for people who have no dreams. The problem with the Garden Cities as they have in fact materialised is that they are neither fish nor fowl; more precisely, they are hard to distinguish from suburbs. This might have been different if Howard\u2019s original cooperative dream had been preserved.75 As might be expected, Sharp disliked the suburbs as much as he did the Garden City, speaking of them as an escape by \u2018an unorganised band of prisoners breaking gaol, with no very definite plans for what lies before them\u2019.76 He had in mind the suburbs of mid war Britain, but of course suburbs are as old as cities themselves. The suburbs of Graeco Roman cities were an integral part 1 Ibid., p. 586. 2 Ibid., p.587. 3 Ibid., p. 595. 2 73 Sharp, 7 own and Countryside, p. 143. 74 Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 27. 3 75 As Robert Fishman argues. Urban Utopias in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1982). 4 76 T. Sharp, Town Planning (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1940), p. 40. of the city, the site of cemeteries, graves, industrial buildings, larger public buildings stadii, amphitheatre and circuses, characterised by shrines, monuments, gardens and trees.1 In the medieval city the suburb was the faubourg, in which dwelt small tradesmen, craftsmen and foreigners free from guild or city company restrictions. It was known as a focus of crime, disorder and disease. The modern suburb is quite different from either of these, and is a joint result of the growth of an urban middle class, with its own social ethos, of new modes of transport, and of the reaction to industrialisation. From the start it was residential, and represented an escape from the soot and dirt of the city to a place with gardens and seclusion. The ideology it represented was individualist, but ironically collective transport was essential to its development. The horse drawn omnibus was introduced on the Paddington City route in 1829. The development of the underground made mass transport from periphery to centre possible, and the suburban development which Sharp so much lamented was driven above all by the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines, which advertised themselves in terms of an escape to the country. Despite the original aim of creating rus in urbe the modern suburb undeniably lacks both the community of the village and the energy of the town. Suburbs have been the target of fierce social critique, and, although they probably provide the mainstay of the Church\u2019s financial support, they are often tacitly despised by the inner city theologians, as places of comfort and affluence without obvious links to Jesus\u2019 original discipleship community. We have to remember the basic rule, however, that people ensoul places, and that goes even for the suburbs. Herbert Cans among others argues that the popularity of the suburbs both in the US and in Britain is still growing, and for many represents the continuing ideal of a higher quality of life.2 We cannot on a priori grounds reject the place where so many people choose to live. The Spirit of God is not absent even there, and they are not as sterile as Sharp imagined. John Hartley argues that the suburbs can be politically blamed for creating an apathetic, reactionary, conservative, conformist petit bourgeois class; being economically unproductive; falling apart socially into atomised units; being sexually the place of women\u2019s subjugation; aesthetically being unstylish, twee, naff, genteel, dull, desolate, ugly; spiritually having an awful uniformity; and philosophically violating the binary opposition 1 E. J. Owens, The City in the Greek and Roman World (London: Routledge, 1991), p. 153. 2 H. Gans, The Levittowners (London: Allen Lane, 1967), p. 432, and often; more recently in People, Plans and Policies. Essays on Poverty ; Racism and Other National Urban Problems (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991). of town and country.1 Every item here can be granted, but only on the understanding that these rules are broken in every suburb. The strength of the suburban church is part of the strength of the suburbs as a whole. The suburban church is part of a network of neighbourhood associations which flourish in the suburbs, from gardening, to bowls, to country dancing to amateur drama.2 Naff and genteel many of these are, and I have chosen my examples deliberately.3 True, \u2018community\u2019 only too often means dinner parties and barbecues, and the uniformed organisations. But there is also a great deal of energy in the suburbs which is outwardly directed, as any major charity would attest. In the economy of redemption, it is sometimes argued, the suburbs represent the most perfect form of the Deuteronomic vision, \u2018every family under its vine and fig tree\u2019, which history has yet witnessed. The energy of the move to the future is not, perhaps, to be expected from a settled history but it remains, for all that, part of the pattern of redemption. Whether or not this applies to Joel Garreau\u2019s \u2018Edge Cities\u2019 is much more debatable. These are the new developments of offices and housing which have sprung up around the great American cities: they are neither urban nor rural, and they contain more industry than the suburbs. They are, as Paul Barker correctly insists, created by the car, the computer and the fax machine as surely as New York or Liverpool were created by ocean going ships, and Chicago or Manchester by the railway.4 They are dependent on a network of high speed roads. Garreau describes them as \u2018the new Frontier\u2019, \u2018a vigorous world of pioneers\u2019 responding to the advent of Information Technology. They are therefore generated, he argues, by the construction of five million square feet of leasable office space in an area where people can also live in considerable suburban comfort. He is an enthusiast, but many of those he interviewed were not. People complained that these places were plastic, a hodgepodge, Disneyland, and lacked livability, civilisation, community and a soul. 1 J. Hartley in R. Silverstone (ed.), Visions of Suburbia (London: Routledge, 1977), pp 184 5. 2 In Exeter, for example, which is largely suburban, and which has a population of 160,000 people, there are more than 600 associations outside the major national organisations. Gans drew attention to the strength of the suburban church, and explained it by the need to belong to the community (. Levittowners, p. 265). Since his data were collected in the early 1960s such findings may need substantial revision. 3 It is interesting that in Britain the most politically radical singers of the second half ofthe twentieth century lived in the suburbs. Ewan MacGoll and Peggy Seeger lived in Bromley, and at the time of writing Leon Rosselson still lives in Wembley. 4 Paul Barker in A. Barnett and R. Scruton (eds.), Town and Country (London: Jonathan Cape, 1998), p. 212. They also used Sharp\u2019s word, \u2018sterile\u2019.1 It is fair to argue that all cities are chaotic in their origins, but whether these conglomerations will develop the sense of identity to become true cities must be doubtful, just because they are so heavily reliant on the car and Information Technology. Their future seems to be as an extension of the suburb. Another attempt to marry town and country, or rather, to dissolve the distinction, was Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s \u2018Broadacre City\u2019.2 Wright, too, loathed the city, and envisaged people living in homesteads with about one acre of land, growing their own vegetables, travelling everywhere by car, and meeting at \u2018activity nodes\u2019 for cultural or sports activities. It was the architectural descendant of the American frontier dream, only this time, instead of the native population it was the environment which would ultimately suffer. The cities have not disappeared, as he thought they would, and growing potatoes has proved unattractive to those who live in their large mock ranches. Instead there is vast suburban sprawl, and the highest car usage in the world. Meanwhile, \u2018Broadacre City\u2019 might characterise most of rural southern England, with the poor pushed out to \u2018affordable housing\u2019, or blocks of council houses on the edge of villages, and the rich living in the houses of their ancestors and their ancestors\u2019 masters, and travelling to \u2018cultural nodes\u2019 in nearby county towns. This development, alongside the growth of highly mechanised and \u2018rationalised\u2019 agriculture, dissolves the distinction of town and country for the wealthy few, but in fact reinforces it by making the countryside a private park, and completing the process of enclosure which began at the end of the fifteenth century. TOWN AND COUNTRY IN THE ECONOMY OF REDEMPTION Historically town and country have indeed played very different roles in what I have called the Irenaean process of redemption. Is that variety of roles now over, destroyed by the growth of private transport, of the telephone and the World Wide Web? Even in the North, where counter urbanisation is a significant factor, does the insular village of a century ago any longer exist? Ought we to want it to? The economy of redemption is that process by which God makes and keeps human life human. Villages, towns and suburbs all contribute distinctively to this process but at the same time all fail distinctively. At the 1 J. Garreau, Edge City (New York: Anchor Doubleday, 1988), p. 8. 2 Garreau believes that \u2018Edge City\u2019 is a realisation of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Broadacre City. heart of the economy of redemption lies the cross. What significance does the cross have for our understanding of settlements in the economy of redemption? Paul talks of\u2018dying to sin\u2019 (Rom. 6.2) and it is this process which each form of human settlement has to undergo in its own distinctive way. \u2018Sin\u2019 is a theological code word for forms of behaviour which diminish or destroy life. To \u2018die\u2019 to sin is to address those life denying sides of our selves and our community, to \u2018put them to death\u2019 so that they do not put our neighbours and the environment to death. As related to our three forms of environment we can say that to be a truly humanising place the village has to die to its class and caste divisions; the city has to die to its factions and its hubristic attitude towards its surrounding villages; the suburb has to die to its atomistic individualism. Only by this process of \u2018death\u2019 can life come to fulfilment in the settlements we create.1 The seventeenth century Puritan John Owen spoke of the \u2018death of death\u2019. Christ may have died \u2018once only, once and once for all\u2019 but what flows from that is a process which continues to the kingdom. In all of our settlements we seek the death of death. When it comes to town and country we can agree that neither God nor human beings made either the country or the town. From the theological point of view, both made both. \u2018Alongside the act of the creature there is always the act of divine wisdom and omnipotence,\u2019 wrote Karl Barth. God \u2018cooperates with the creature, meaning that as he himself works he allows the creature to work. Just as he himself is active in his freedom, the creature can also be active in freedom.\u20192 What the Latin tradition has called \u2018providence\u2019 is in fact the history of grace in which humanisation is accomplished by God in and through human beings, and therefore in and through their settlements. If the urban historians are to be believed we have to ascribe a key role to towns and cities in this process, and it is theologically wrong to do nothing but dream of Eden. On the other hand these towns and cities have to be fed, and this means that, in order to survive, there have to be large rural areas. The idea, mooted in Britain at least, that a country can surrender its agriculture, and maintain itself exclusively by light industry and services, is ludicrous.3 There is also 1 In similar fashion Kjellberg writes: \u2018The city has to humble itself in the sense that it can never survive without the countryside, the home of agriculture.5 The interconnectedness of rural and urban life can be seen as part of the relationship of\u2018oneness5 with the cosmos itself.

Barth, Church Dogmatics III/3 (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, 1961), p. 92. 3 Churchill said in 1953: \u201850 million people dwelling in a small island, growing enough food for only, shall we say, 20 million. That is a spectacle of lese majeste and insecurity that history has not often seen before.5 the question of human scale, and much advocacy of decentralised living, with small villages and communes as alternatives to large cities, is seeking precisely that. This is above all what the village provided. Mumford talks of the mothering and life promoting environment of the village, its stability and security, rooted in reciprocal human relations and relations with other organisms and communities.1 To go on to speak of the village as an \u2018unguarded democracy\u2019 in which each member plays their appropriate role at each stage in the life cycle is much too strong for any village in a class society. In peasant societies, when village life is bonded to unremittingly hard manual labour, people move at the pace of the seasons. One can understand the nostalgia for that slower pace of life, especially now the memory of its harsh reality has faded, at least in the West. Given the world\u2019s burgeoning population David Harvey may be right that it is the urban which has to move to the centre of our attention \u2018relative to much of the contemporary preoccupation with wilderness, peripheral peasant movements, preservation of scenic landscapes and the like\u2019.2 On the other hand the Soviet attempt to abolish the distinction between town and country was not a success and by 1989 those who opted for the \u2018idiocy of rural life\u2019 were often better off than their urban neighbours.3 There is a strong whiff of hubris about some enthusiasm for the mega city, and about the casual assumption, noted in the third chapter, that \u2018food security is a thing of the past\u2019. The Network Society still needs to be fed, and this implies agriculture, and agricultural communities. The Worldwatch Institute warns annually about the need to conserve fertile land to feed the numbers which increase day by day, and questions about the wisdom and efficacy of agribusiness continue to rise. Could it be, then, that at the moment of the \u2018world historical triumph of the city\u2019 the need to reinvent or re discover the town country distinction may once again be forced upon us? 1 Mumford, City, p. 636. 2 D.

The meaning of the city \u2018Gome, let us make bricks, and bake them thoroughly... Gome, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.\u2019 (Genesis n. 3 5) What is a city? Since everyone knows what a city is the question seems unnecessary, but the answer is not as simple as it might seem at first sight. A city, for example, is not just a very large town. As we saw in the last chapter, population is sometimes suggested as a marker, ranking anywhere with more than a hundred thousand inhabitants as a city. But London\u2019s largest borough, Harrow, has a population of more than a million, and it is certainly not a city. Furthermore, there have been quite small cities \u2014 Periclean Athens and fifteenth century Florence spring to mind which have been amongst the greatest cities in human history. What is it, then, which defines a city? Joel Garreau lists industry, governance, commerce, safety, culture, companionship, and religion as the function of cities, and on those grounds argues that Edge Cities are proper cities.1 All these too, however, could be found in large boroughs which were not properly cities. Jane Jacobs wants to define the city in terms of consistent generation of economic growth from the local economy. In her view any settlement that becomes good at import replacing becomes a city.2 There are many examples of cities in decline, however, like fifteenth century Rome, or cities which are off today\u2019s world trade map, like Addis Ababa, which challenge such an economic definition. Kostofif proposes a whole range 1 J. Garreau, Edge City (New York: Anchor Doubleday, 1991), p 26. H. Pirenne ( Medieval Cities: Their Origins and the Revival of Trade (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1948)) suggests that a city may be defined as \u2018a locality the population of which, instead of living by working the soil, devotes itself to commercial activity\u2019 (p. 35). Alternatively it may be a community endowed with legal personality and possessing laws and institutions peculiar to itself (p. 46). 2 J. Jacobs, Cities and the Wealth of Nations (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1986; first published 1984), PP* 39 &gt; 4 1* of criteria: a place where there is an energised crowding of people; a place where there is specialised differentiation of work; places favoured by a source of income; that rely on written records; that have a territory which feeds them; that are distinguished by some kind of monumental definition; which have some kind of physical circumscription to mark them off from the non urban realm; and which are part of an urban system.1 Clearly some of these markers would apply equally to villages and towns. More simply Peter Hall describes them as \u2018places for people who can stand the heat of the kitchen\u2019, places full of adrenalin, and for that reason places superbly worth living in.2 In this respect they are different from small towns or villages. Even here, however, we can instance sleepy or rather dull cities like Bonn which are nevertheless true cities. Another attempt to define what it is that makes a city, alluded to by Kostoff, begins from the relation of city to region. What decisively marks off a city from a town, according to Geddes and Branford, is that a city \u2018accumulates and embodies the heritage of a region, and combines in some measure and kind with the cultural heritage of larger units, national, racial, religious, human\u2019. The individuality of the city is for them \u2018the sign manual of its regional life and record\u2019. \u2018Regional \u00e9lan vital fruits in civic life. The city and its region compose into the true social unit.\u20193 In a similar way Christian Norberg Schulz speaks of the genius loci of cities as involving the \u2018gathering\u2019 of local and more distant meanings. \u2018In the town \u201cforeign\u201d meanings meet the local genius, and create a more complex system of meanings. The urban genius is never merely local.\u20194 Christopher Day puts the relation of city and region in terms of spirituality. When you go from countryside to market town, he argues, you feel this intensified spirit. You feel it even where towns have been swollen and distorted by industry. Paris, Edinburgh or Washington have the spirit of France, Scotland or America as unmistakably as Bristol or Newcastle have the west or the north of England.5 In the city it is the mood of the region which finds expression in the built environment, which is why Mumford spoke of the region as well as the city as \u2018a collective work of art\u2019. The invocation of the idea of a resident \u2018genius\u2019 calls 1 S. Kostoff, The City Shaped (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1991), pp. 38 40. 2 P.

Polity, p. 158. to mind Wink\u2019s account of the reality of the Powers, mentioned in the first chapter. Drawing on that idea I want to argue that cities, by virtue of their tradition, or their activity, the way in which they \u2018gather\u2019 their regions, have a degree of creative spirituality which other places lack. It is this which constitutes their place in the economy of redemption, and this which the book of Revelation means by the \u2018angel\u2019 of a city, indicated by the fact that they are often addressed as corporate personalities in Scripture. THE DIALECTIC OF CITIES To talk of the creative spirituality of cities is to invoke at once millennia of anti city polemic, beginning, perhaps, with the gloomy assessment of cities in the book of Genesis. Looking back to that time of pastoral nomads the author of Hebrews wrote: \u2018By faith [Abraham] stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob... For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God\u2019 (Heb. 11.9,10). This seems to imply that the earthly city has no foundations worth counting. Is it a relativisation of the city, teaching us that our true citizenship is eternal, or could it be construed as an eschatological promise for the cities in which we actually live? There is certainly a deep ambivalence towards the city in the Christian tradition which is recognised and shared today by many secular theorists.8 On the one hand the city is understood as a focus of violence and human hubris \u2014 this is the significance of the fact that both Gain and Nimrod are said to be the founders of cities. On the other hand the city is the model of what will finally be redeemed, the paradigm of the human home and the focus of human creativity. The city is both Babylon, the place of alienation, exile, estrangement and violence, and Jerusalem, the place where God dwells, sets God\u2019s sign, and invites humankind to peace. This twofold imaging of the city calls for a dialectic. Any city is always at any one time both Babylon and Jerusalem, as we are reminded by Jesus\u2019 description of Jerusalem, the city of peace, as the one who stones the prophets (Luke 19.41). The danger with dialectical perceptions is that they tend to fall apart. Thus, on the one hand, doom laden views of the city abound, especially Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, Lewis Mumford and Peter Hall all express this ambivalence \u2014 and especially Mumford. on the part of those worried about the environmental impact of cities.1 From the fourth century on there is often a sour hostility to the city amongst Christians. In the city, said John Chrysostom, the devil uses \u2018lewd sights, base speech, degraded music and songs full of all kinds of wickedness\u2019 to lead us on the road to damnation.2 The most famous Christian account of the city, Augustine\u2019s City of God, is usually regarded as stressing the negative side of the earthly city. The earthly city, he tells us right at the beginning of his work, is marked by a \u2018lust for domination\u2019 \u2014 a fair enough comment on imperial Rome, which is his paradigm earthly city.3 It lives by self love carried to the point of contempt for God, whilst the civitas Dei lives by the love of God marked by contempt for self.4 \u2018The one city loves its own strength shown in its powerful leaders; the other says to its God, \u201cI will love you, my Lord, my strength.\u201d513 Whilst it is on pilgrimage in this world the civitas Dei is a collection of resident aliens which \u2018makes use of the earthly peace and defends and seeks the compromise between human wills in respect of the provisions relevant to the mortal nature of man\u2019.5 They occupy the same physical city, do the same sort of jobs, live under the same laws, but goal and orientation separate them.6 What the earthly city prizes is for the most part illusory.7 True happiness will only be realised in the perfect peace of the eschatological kingdom.8 This negative view reappears at the Enlightenment and on to the present. Thomas Jefferson regarded cities as \u2018pestilential to the morals, the health and liberties of man\u2019.18 For some contemporary writers the city is parasitic on natural and domesticated environments, since it makes no food, cleans no air, and cleans very little water to the point where it could be re used. For Mayur cities are \u2018overgrown monstrosities with gluttonous appetites for material goods and fast declining carrying capacities... Only catastrophe awaits such a system of disharmony.\u201919 On the other side we find endorsements of the city from some Christian theologians, obviously reflecting their vastly different situation. 1 Mary Grey cites as examples of such pessimistic assessments Frank Norris\u2019 novel The Pit, about Chicago, Charles Williams\u2019 Taliessin through Logres, and Thomas Merton. \u2018The Shape of the Human Home\u2014AResponse to Tim Gorringe\u2019, Political Theology 3 (November 2000), pp. 95 103. 2 John Chrysostom, De Poenitentia vi. 3 Augustine, The City of God, Bk 1, Preface. 3 12 By \u2018civitas Augustine means something like \u2018community\u2019. 9 Ibid., Bk 14.28. 4 14 Ibid., Bk 19.17. 6 Ibid., Bk 1.35. 7 Ibid., Bk 19.4 10. 8 Ibid., Bk 19.13. 5 Wright (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1977), p. 17. 6 !9 G.

The Finnish biologist Pentti Linkola likewise claims that cities destroy everything valuable 8 for a good life. S. Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheohgy (Utrecht: International Books, 2000), p. 112. 9 18 Cited in M. White and L.White, The Intellectual Versus the City: From Thomas Jefferson to Frank Lloyd Where Augustine wrote against the background of the still powerful, if senescent, presence of imperial Rome, Isidore of Seville\u2019s world in the seventh century needed cities to survive in a turbulent world of barbarian invasions. For this reason \u2018[t]he Church of Isidore\u2019s time became a congregation of builders. From the sixth to the tenth century the Christian obligation to provide shelter was put into practice, and a network of cities developed.\u20191 The twelfth century and thirteenth century theologians shared in the sense of a new springtime after a greater peace had at last descended on Europe, and trade, law and learning were all at last beginning to pick up, and cities blossoming into new life. No surprise, then, that Abelard, living and working in Paris, could speak of cities as \u2018convents\u2019 for married people, where they could live together in charity.2 According to Aquinas in the next century the city (again civitas but this time this particular type of settlement) is the most complete of all human communities (as opposed, say, to monasteries or villages). The study of the city is called politics, \u2018a branch of practical philosophy which excels all others since it deals with the most perfect means of procuring goodness in human affairs through the use of human reason\u2019.3 It excels all others because theology understands community as essential to human flourishing. For this reason, as we saw in the first chapter, he took from Aristotle detailed plans for the construction of the city, all aimed at the realisation of the good life. Although the Reformation was an urban phenomenon it did not produce an urban theology. Perhaps this is because it all but coincided with the rise of the cult of nature and a renewed moral critique of the city, as we saw in the last chapter.4 Nineteenth century theology could hardly affirm the \u2018cities of dreadful night\u2019, but the centrality of cities to God\u2019s purposes was newly affirmed by the secular city theology of the 1960s for which the city was the central icon of modern culture. Though this theology was quickly superseded, the liberation theology which followed it, with its emphasis on God\u2019s presence on the margins, often seemed to suggest that the inner city was a privileged locus for God\u2019s presence, to 1 R. Sennett, The Conscience of the Eye (New York: Norton, 1990), p. 11. 2 Peter Abelard, Theologia Christiana, 1143 56, in E. M. Buytaert (ed.), Petti Abaelardi opera theologica, 11 Corpus Christianorum xn (Brepols: Turnhout, 1969), pp. 149 155. His own history, of course, seems tragically to deny that. 3 Aquinas, Sententia Libri Politicorum&gt; Opera omniavm (Paris, 1891), Prologue A 69 70. 4 Though \u2018the cult of nature\u2019 had to wait for the eighteenth century, attitudes to nature were already changing in the sixteenth, as we can see from As You Like /\u00bf, in which the natural world, which opposes nothing to human beings but \u2018winter and rough weather\u2019, is opposed to the malice of the human world. the occlusion of either the comfortable suburb or the countryside. The inner cities and housing estates are alienated from sources of power and influence, writes John Vincent, and as such feel a kinship with Jesus and his friends. Like the nuclear community of the kingdom of God which Jesus set up in his disciple group, the urban disciple community today represents perhaps a new humanity, a new \u2018Son of Man\u2019, free of race and class and economic and cultural distinction, perhaps because, being nearer the bottom, they know what the basics of human existence are, and what it is that moulds and even secures human beings in mutuality and survival and in the hope of significance very like the simple basic rules and common life ofjesus and his disciples.1 Whilst I agree with the basic thesis of liberation theology of God\u2019s \u2018bias to the poor\u2019, a theology which seeks to follow the humanising work of God in history will not, I believe, be able to make such an undialectical assessment. Most theologies tend to fall on one side or the other of this dialectic. In the twentieth century the most searching theological expression of the ambivalence of the city was provided by Jacques Ellul, as noted briefly in the first chapter. He treated the city as a paradigm of the situation of humankind under sin and grace, calling therefore for a radically dialectical treatment.2 On the one hand the city is a memorial to human conquest.3 It is a world \u2018for which man is not made\u2019. We find no law concerning the city because \u2018God has cursed, has condemned, the city instead of giving us a law for it.\u20194 The city originates in the refusal of Eden, humankind\u2019s provided home, and the substitution of one humankind provides for itself.5 It begins, then, with the rejection of what is freely given, grace. Urban civilisation is warring civilisation.6 Overlooking much contrary evidence the campaigns of the early Arab 1 J. Vincent, An Urban Hearing for the Gospel\u2019, in C. Rowland and J. Vincent (eds.), Gospel from the City (Sheffield: Urban Theology Unit, 1997), p. 112. 2 Ward misses the ambivalence of Ellul\u2019s account, finding only separation here. G. Ward, Cities of God (London: Routledge, 2000), pp. 48fi 3 J. Ellul, The Meaning of the City (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1970), p. 16. 4 Ibid., p. 47. 5 Ibid., p. 5. 5 29 Ibid., p. 13. He derives this from the name Nimrod, the next city builder after Gain, which he translates \u2018plunderer\u2019, and from the name of one of the cities he builds, which means \u2018cavalry\u2019. Mumford agrees with him here. \u2018Every part of life became a struggle.. a gladiatorial contest... the new myths were mainly expressions of relentless opposition, struggle, aggression... Though the more cooperative village practices retained their hold in the workshop and the field, it is precisely in the new functions of the city that the truncheon and the whip called politely the 6 sceptre made themselves felt.\u2019 L. Mumford, The City in History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 199 '). P 65 invaders, the German and Scandinavian invaders who formed present day Europe, the Huns and Mongols and more recently Pol Pot Ellul maintains that there is no such thing as a great agricultural war. \u2018A rural people is never a ravenous people... War is an urban phenomenon.\u20191 The city embodies spiritual power. In fact, for Ellul, it is one of the \u2018principalities and powers\u2019, in a sense more negative than that proposed by Wink.2 It is not the people in a city who are cursed, but \u2018the city\u2019 as a spiritual entity, as what embodies humankind organised against God.3 The city is a cursed place by its origin, its structure, its selfish withdrawal and its search for other gods.4 Sin, \u2018the world\u2019 and the powers of hell are all symbolised in the city. \u2018In the clear vision of the Lord\u2019s Spirit the truth about Rome is the truth about Moscow, about Berlin, about Paris and about Washington.\u20195 The life of a powerful city is always a constant succession of revolts against God. This is notwithstanding the fact that the city is the product of good will, \u2018the engineer\u2019s bright eye, the urbanist\u2019s broad sweep of mind, the hygienist\u2019s idealism\u2019. The results, however, speak for themselves: slavery tolerated and human relations destroyed in the anonymity of the great city. It is a familiar theme: the best virtues of good pagans are nothing but splendid vices. The city is the greatest human work, the attempt to attain autonomy. \u2018No other of man\u2019s works technical or philosophical is equivalent to the city, which is the creation not of an instrument but of the whole world in which man\u2019s instruments are conceived and put to work.\u201935 Because the city is the great means of separation between human beings and God, the place human beings made to be alone, \u2018she is the very centre of the world\u2019s disorder, and it is therefore useless to speak to her of order\u2019.36 Alongside all this negation, however, lies affirmation, as noted briefly in the first chapter. From the oldest period \u2018there was a tendency to pardon, to accept the city\u2019.37 Thus Nineveh itself, the bloody city, is saved by Jonah\u2019s preaching. But of course mention of Nineveh shows that the city is not necessarily unredeemed. There is the possibility of reconciliation with God in the city (Ps. 87.4). In the cities of refuge the city plays a positive role in the order of preservation which is part of God\u2019s plan for the world (Num. 35; Josh. 20).38 The purpose of these cities is to 1 Ellul Meaning, p. 51. 2 Wink always assumes that the powers are created, fallen and can be redeemed. As it turns out, Ellul shares this view, but in speaking of the city as one of the powers he intends it wholly negatively, as a force aimed against God. 3 He appeals to Isa. 14.12\u201415; Ezek 28.1\u20149 f\u00b0r this reading. 4 Ellul, Meaning, p. 60. 5 Ibid., p. 50. 35 Ibid., p. 154. 5 36 Ibid., p. 119. 37 Ibid., p. 72. 38 Ibid., p. 90. ensure greater justice.39 Mumford, too, notes the same function. Even if power was the mainstay of the new city, he says, \u2018it became increasingly shaped and directed by new institutions of law and order and social comity\u2019.40 As trade grew the part played by the city as a seat of law and justice, reason and equity also grew, supplementing the part it played as a religious representation of the cosmos. The city, therefore, is both a centre of violence and protection against it. Ellul goes further than this, however, in finding in Jerusalem an analogy to the incarnation. In the promise to David, God takes possession of Jerusalem and in so doing symbolically takes possession of all cities. Christ had no conciliatory or pardoning words for the cities, but his death and resurrection mean that the city is now a neutral world where human beings can be free again, where there are possibilities for action. There is no question of expecting a new Jerusalem on earth, for the new Jerusalem will be God\u2019s creation, absolutely free, unforseeable, and transcendent, but God\u2019s act gives human beings room for autonomous action.4' In particular the person of faith is involved in a batde on a spiritual plane, a battle comparable to Abraham\u2019s battle for Sodom, in praying for the good of the city. \u2018We must ask God to take away this condemnation which we know so well, and herein lies our liberty in relation to the city.\u201942 This dialectic cannot be regarded as a peculiarity of theologians, for it is shared by urban theorists like Mumford. On the one hand the city is \u2018the most precious collective invention of civilization... second only to language itself in the transmission of culture\u2019. It is through the city that labour is sufficiently organised to channel the forces of nature and establish order and justice.43 On the other hand there is a \u2018negative symbiosis\u2019 resting on war, exploitation, enslavement, and parasitism. Mumford\u2019s concern is that the former aspect should not be eclipsed by the latter. David Harvey agrees. The city is both the high point of human achievement, and the site of squalid human failure, \u2018the lightning rod of the profoundest human discontents, and the arena of social and political conflict. It is a place of mystery, the site of the unexpected, full of agitations and ferments, of multiple liberties, opportunities and alienations; of passions and repressions; of cosmopolitanism and extreme parochialisms; of violence, innovation and reaction.\u201944 Henri Lefebvre remarks that the modern city is not thought out because we have not resolved the 39 Ibid., p. 92. 40 Mumford, City, p. 63. 41 Ellul, Meaning, p. 170. 42 Ibid., p. 75. 43 Mumford, City, p. 67. 44 D. Harvey, The Urban Experience (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989), p. 229. contradiction between these two traditions but in fact the dialectic is ineluctable.45 Like all human life cities make manifest the dialectic of sin and grace but it is in what they contribute to the furtherance of life that they play their role in the economy of redemption. CITIES IN THE ECONOMY OF REDEMPTION Haddon Willmer puts the question of redemption squarely by asking what sort of humanity is encouraged by different types of city.46 It is clear that whilst all cities may share certain features in common, some are far more creative, or humanising, than others. In particular we have to ask, as Faith in the City did, what cities do for the poor.47 Much Christian writing about the city is about the struggle of the poor and their triumph over adversity, especially in the genre of\u2018urban theology\u2019. But if we think about the Indian poor, for example, flooding into the cities from the villages and increasing city populations by tens of thousands every day, we could ask whether it would not be better for them, as Gandhi thought, to remain in the village, where they have the same poverty, but not the same pollution; the same oppression, but not the same pressures of crime and prostitution. Cities, generations of fiction and film have taught us, are characterised by \u2018mean streets\u2019 where only the fittest survive. In the stories of the poor, what is creative about the city as such, and what is human hope and courage rising above appalling odds? In enquiring about the redemptive and humanising aspect of cities it is essential to keep that question in view. In his history of Western Europe during the first Christian millennium Peter Brown illustrates the way in which cities were, for many centuries, literally life saving. Those in the rural hinterlands retreated behind city walls when raiders came, and the Church played a central part in maintaining them once the old structures of the Roman Empire had disappeared. \u2018Walls and bishops went together.\u2019 The Church helped cope with famine and siege by charitable work and \u2018the buildings of the church spoke of the day to day determination of cities to survive and 4 5 H. Lefebvre, Writings on Cities, tr. E. Kofman and E. Lebas (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), pp. 205\u20146. 46 H. Willmer, \u2018Images of the City and the Shaping of Humanity\u2019, in A. Harvey (ed.), Theology in the City (London: SPCK, 1989), p. 34. 47 I take for granted the debate about relative deprivation made famous by Peter Townsend. In speaking of \u2018the poor\u2019 I have in mind both the destitution of the Indian city I know best, Madurai, where some communities live on pavements or by railway tracks, but also the relative poverty encountered everywhere in the North, which excludes many from the goods enjoyed by the majority. In Britain at the turn of the millennium over a million households are officially homeless, and around five million people have an income below the European poverty line. Mumford\u2019s claim goes back to Aristotle who, improbably from our point of view, thinks of cities as nurseries of the virtues. The city, he says, originates in the union of a number of villages which come together for the bare needs of life, \u2018and continue in existence for the sake of a good life\u2019.51 The good life is directed towards the goals proper to humans, namely to produce human beings who embody courage, temperance, liberality, magnificence, greatness of soul, gentleness, being agreeable in company, wittiness and modesty. This can only be done in a city because such virtues can only be learned through interaction and fellowship and because the urge for community is part of human nature. To live outside community, therefore, is to live an unnatural life, and community, for Aristotle, is the city. The city exists to promote the flourishing of education and excellence,52 and provides the essential framework for this to happen, for without the justice which the laws of the city imposes human beings are \u2018the most unholy and the most savage of animals, the most full of lust and gluttony\u2019.53 To the objection that it is precisely in the city that lust and gluttony are stimulated, he replies that crime and disorder are to be dealt with by moderate possessions and occupation on the part of the citizens, habits of temperance and the study of philosophy.54 Since the supreme human goal is the exercise of our rationality, this last is the real key. It turns out that the city ultimately exists to make metaphysical contemplation 48 P. Brown, The Rise of Western Christendom (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 61. 49 N. Elias, The Civilising Process (Oxford: Blackwell, 1994). 50 Mumford, City, p. 127 (my italics). 51 Politics 1252I028. 52 Ibid., I283a25. 53 Ibid., I253a37 54 Ibid., i267aio. possible for a tiny number of leisured citizens. As Alasdair MacIntyre remarks, All Aristotle\u2019s conceptual brilliance... declines at the end to an apology for this extraordinarily parochial form of human existence.555 It is also necessary to remind ourselves that the achievements of classical Athens, and the background to Aristotle\u2019s philosophising, depended on extremely cruel treatment of slaves.5\u00ae Aristotle\u2019s claims for the city may have been flawed but this does not mean that the idea of the city as a nursery of the virtues is to be rejected, strange as it seems to us after three centuries of experience of the capitalist city. To make sense of it we need to understand the virtues as those things which promote our humanness, which promote the goods of human flourishing. We can then listen to Mumford\u2019s judgement that \u2018 [t]he final mission of the city is to further man\u2019s conscious participation in the cosmic and the historic process\u2019. Through its own complex and enduring structure, the city vastly augments man\u2019s ability to interpret these processes and take an active, formative part in them, so that every phase of the drama it stages shall have, to the highest degree possible, the illumination of consciousness, the stamp of purpose, the colour of love. That magnification of all the dimensions of life, through emotional communion, rational communication, technological mastery, and above all, dramatic representation, has been the supreme office of the city in history. And it remains the chief reason for the city\u2019s continued existence.1 2 3 The city is the nursery of the virtues in this sense. The city is purposive in a qualitatively different way to the village or town. It represents a corporate attempt to fashion the human future. It is \u2018larger than life\u2019; the buzz of its diverse trades and conditions stimulates both art and ideas. It provides a stage on which even the poor can act, and that they do so is witnessed by urban theologians. Panache, says Laurie Green, \u2018is a quality highly valued and applauded in most Urban Priority cultures whether it be expressed as a \u2018Jack the lad\u201d jauntiness or capitalized 1 A. MacIntyre, A Short History of Ethics (London: Routledge, 1967), p. 83. 2 Thus Oswyn Murray writes: \u2018The skeletons and evidence of living 300 feet underground in tunnels fed with air through downdrafts created by fires halfway up the shafts, the niche for the guard at the mine entrance, and the fact that the tunnels were so small that the face workers must have crawled and knelt at their work while all porterage was carried out by pre adolescent children, reveal the truth... It is an appalling indictment of Athenian indifference that Nicias, whose money was made from child labour of this sort, could widely be regarded as the most moral and religious man ofhis generation. \u2018Life and Society in Classical Greece\u2019, in J.

Murray (eds.), The Oxford History of the Classical World (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 224. 3 Mumford, City, pp. 655 6. upon in the street market trader\u2019.1 The scene which is acted may be tragedy, comedy, tragical historical, scene individable or poem unlimited, as Hamlet puts it, but in and through it the dimensions of life are magnified and consciousness illumined. All creativity requires a balance between stability and anarchy, for where there is perfect order there is death. For this reason, Peter Hall argues, creative cities are places in which social relationships, values and views of the world are in the throes of transformation. \u2018Conservative, stable societies will not prove creative; but neither will societies in which all order, all points of reference, have disappeared. To a remarkable degree, creative cities have been those in which an old established order, a too long established order, was being challenged or had just been overthrown.\u20192 Practically speaking this means that creative cities are often immigrant cities. \u2018The creative cities were nearly all cosmopolitan; they drew talent from the four corners of their worlds... Probably no city has ever been creative without continual renewal of the creative bloodstream.\u20193 Cosmopolitanism, of course, is one of the key distinguishing markers between city and town. The creativity of cities is manifested above all in the arts, in the economy, and in industry. With regard to the arts the champion of the suburb, Herbert Cans, argues that cities are not necessary for their flourishing. Historically speaking it is simply the fact that they have housed the rich who have supported the creators of culture which gives this impression. Today it is perfectly possible to live in the suburbs without loss of creativity.4 Whilst many creative people doubtless live in the suburbs, however, there is the question of concentration, the electricity of creativity, the possibility for the innovative to spark each other off, which we find, for example, in Paris at \u2018the moment of Cubism\u2019 or in Periclean Athens, Renaissance Florence, Elizabethan London, and so forth. Putting one\u2019s finger on what precisely generates this creativity is, however, no easy matter. Peter Hall, who considers the question in detail in Cities in Civilization, admits that \u2018it becomes increasingly hard to find any single satisfactory explanation\u2019.62 He does, however, find instability an essential part of the creative mix. Thus he believes that in quattrocento Florence it is rapid accumulation of wealth, and a resultant breakdown 1 L. Green, \u2018Physicality in the UPA\u2019, in P. Sedgwick (ed.), God in the City: Essays and Reflectionsfrom the Archbishop\u2019s Urban Theology Group (London: Mowbray. 1995), p. 109. 2 Hall, Cities in Civilization, p. 286. 3 Ibid., p. 285. 3 61 H. Gans, The Levittowners (London: Allen Lane, 1967), p. 424. 4 62 Hall, Cities in Civilization, p. 282. of values, which produces the explosion of creative power which gives us Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo and all the rest. But like Elizabethan London this city was not at all a nice place, Hall points out, a place of sweetness and light, but a place of murder and mayhem alongside great spirituality and dynamic commercialism. \u2018Perhaps the sense of moral breakdown is the price such a society necessarily pays.\u2019\u00ae3 I shall return to this question shortly. As well as being centres of artistic creativity, cities are also nurseries of industrial innovation and experiment. Laurie Green senses \u2018the majesty, energy and power of God in heavy industry and in that a sense of belonging with God in a solidarity with God\u2019s creativity.... a sense of wonder in industry that we have been given gifts to work with such complexity and find comradeship, worth and identity in the endeavour\u2019.\u00ae4 Hall\u2019s focus is on the processes which make industry possible in the first place, though it is not clear that the innovation he talks about can always be ascribed to cities. In the case of Silicon Valley, for example, universities and the Defence establishment seem to play the key role, along with Schumpeter\u2019s entrepreneurs, whilst in Japan it is \u2018the state as permanent innovator\u2019. What are certainly needed, even in the age of Information Technology, are geographical foci, without which \u2018synergy\u2019, the mutual sparking off of minds, does not happen. He also finds for the cities he mentions Manchester, Glasgow, Berlin and Detroit a position on the fringe, but not in outer darkness, a tradition of work in the area in which innovation came. Marginality meant the absence of well established hierarchies, and therefore an egalitarian ethos was possible. \u2018There was little sense of deference. Careers were open to talents. The prevailing ethos, whether inspired by Protestant religion or hedonism or by shintoism, encouraged achievement in commerce and industry and the making of money.\u2019\u00ae5 Hall seems to put the heroic tradition in first place, the Schumpeterian entrepreneur beginning in his or her garage or garret, but all his instances illustrate the importance of networking, which, in crucial instances, produces \u2018chains or cascades of innovation\u2019. The \u2018career open to talents\u2019 is indeed one of the key creative aspects of the city. Here is one of the classic ways in which the city in itself is supposed to be able to better the life of the poor. The medieval German saying that Stadtluft machtfrei nachjahr und Tag points to the way in which it has been possible to escape the social policing of small communities or, Ibid., p. 71. 64 L. Green, \u2018Blowing bubbles: Poplar\u2019, in God in the City, p. 75. in the middle ages, feudal obligation, in the more tolerant, or perhaps simply more commercial, atmosphere of the city. But as Mumford points out, what was meant by freedom changed in the transition from medieval to early capitalist city. The medieval city gave freedom from feudal restrictions, whereas the eighteenth century city gave freedom for private investment and profit without reference to the welfare of the community as a whole. This change is linked to the city\u2019s role as market. Without doubt cities have been the mainspring of dynamic economies and it can be argued that they remain today the driving force of the world economy.1 But then, as Bernard Mandeville pointed out near the beginning of the present, capitalist, phase of the city, in this world public vices are essential for capitalist survival. In the city \u2018Luxury/Employ\u2019d a Million of the Poor/And odious Pride a million more.\u2019\u00ae2 In Ireland Mandeville\u2019s book was burned by the hangman because he argued that Christian virtues, conscientiously practised, would lead to commercial failure. Both industrial and finance capitalism have been wedded to a Realethik which pours scorn on the Sermon on the Mount. This takes us back to the dangerous nature of artistically creative cities. Hall\u2019s study of the role of the city in civilisation could suggest the Nietzschean thesis that it is Dionysian energy which makes for true humanness, and that Christianity, with its favouring of \u2018the weak\u2019, undermines that. Hall\u2019s running together of creativity and injustice could suggest the thesis of Konrad Lorenz that rough and tumble and inequality is necessary to human creativity, or Hayek\u2019s vision of human history as a moving column. It is regrettable that those in the rear are trampled on, suffer and die, but it is the price we pay for progress, and it is worth it in the long haul.3 Were we to achieve social justice would this perhaps mean a dull, safe suburban existence for all which would destroy the exercise of our creativity? To put it bluntly, are Christian virtues humanly counter productive? Artistically we have the disaster of periodic bouts of religious iconoclasm: Savonarola burning piles of great works of art in the market square at Florence because they contravened what he took to be Christian standards of morality. Ought we, then, to redefine the 1 Finance capital still has relatively few powerful bases: New York, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Hong Kong, but the position of the great corporations which control the global economy is less clear. They tend to have a host nation, but it is of their essence that they can move freely and at a moment\u2019s notice to places where labour is cheapest. 2 B. Mandeville, The Fable of the Bees (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1914, orig. 1714). 3 K. Lorenz, The Waning of Humaneness (London: Unwin, 1988); F. Hayek, The Road to Serfdom (London: ARK, 1986). virtues, as Nietzsche proposed, and produce a new list, as those things which promote capitalist success?69 Are Christians eternal Malvolios, protesting against the enjoyment of cakes and ale? How does the gospel respond to the fact that feelings of aggression and sexuality are important survival instincts in the city?7\u00b0 Is Mary Whitehouse right, or Nobuyoshi Araki with his claim that \u2018without obscenity our cities are dreary places and life is bleak?\u20197' If, as I have claimed, all creativity ultimately derives from God, is there an opus aliermm in God, wedded to mayhem and creative destruction, alongside God\u2019s opusproprium discerned in Christ? To put the question in this way is already to answer it. The gospel can have no truck with social Darwinism of any kind. It is predicated on the assumption that true human flourishing is bound up with the flourishing of all. The tension between stability and anarchy may be necessary for creativity, but this is quite a different thing from injustice and oppression. Following Mumford I spoke of the \u2018corporate attempt to fashion the future\u2019 in the city, but historically this \u2018corporate\u2019 has not included the poor. Their exclusion was not the necessary condition of creativity, I suggest. On the contrary, we have yet to see what creative potential can be unlocked under conditions of justice, precisely the future to which the prophets of Israel, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and all the greatest teachers of the Church have called us. The creativity we have seen is built on an \u2018in spite of\u2019. What we await is a creativity built on a \u2018because\u2019. SUSTAINABLE CITIES? Will the city continue to play a role in the economy of redemption? With more than half of the world\u2019s population now living in cities, and that proportion changing in favour of the city day by day, it is a poor lookout if they do not. Nevertheless the question is serious. One of the key questions is whether the mega city is sustainable, and what we should do about it if it is not. Mumford noted in the nineteen sixties that New York now covered 2,514 square miles and London was 650 times as big as its medieval predecessor. To hold that such cities represent the new scale of settlement to which human beings must adapt their institutions and personal needs was, he said, \u2018to mask the realities of the human situation and allow seemingly automatic forces to become a substitute for human 69 John Atherton, for example, suggests self interest, efficiency, freedom in competition and the importance of individualism as new virtues compatible with the gospel. Christianity and the Market (London: SPGK, 1992). 70 Green \u2018Blowing bubbles: Poplar\u2019, p. 82. 71 N. Araki, Tokyo Lucky Hole (Cologne: Taschen, 1997). purposes\u2019.72 The Population Crisis Committee, reporting in 1990, noted that some cities, such as Tokyo with 30 million, or Mexico City with 20 million, were becoming too big to be efficient.73 Today Sao Paulo and Shanghai also have populations over twenty million. Schumacher felt half a million was the limit of what was desirable. Above such a size, he said, nothing is added to the virtue of the city whilst enormous problems certainly were created.74 For Papanek, social chaos ensues above 120,000.75 Even were we to allow Jane Jacobs\u2019 argument that it is city creativity which stimulates regional growth, cities have always been parasitic on their regions in the sense that they cannot produce the food and water they need for their citizens. The advent of mega cities intensifies this to an extreme degree. Not only are cities the main consumers of energy world wide, but they produce vast quantities of waste, demolish forests and lakes and drive the unsustainable rush for cheap food, reflected outside the city in increasing levels of soil degradation. Murray Bookchin argues that such vast conglomerations cannot be adapted to alternative energy. \u2018To use solar, wind and tidal power effectively, the giant city must be dispersed. A new type of community, carefully tailored to the nature and resources of a region, must replace the sprawling urban belts of today.\u20197\u00ae It is easy to sympathise with Kirkpatrick Sale\u2019s plea for buildings and cities in human scale which can easily be taken in by the human eye, and comfortably walked.77 He formulates what he calls the Beanstalk 72 Mumford, City, p. 616.

Special functional reasons may decrease city size to 20,000 or increase it to 120,000 \u2014 beyond that lies social chaos.\u2019 V.

Kjellberg found in surveys that approaches to the city could be schematised between cosmological and anthropocentric views. He maps them as follows: cosmological holism city as organism nature and man together equitable distribution users\u2019 power unity of all created anthropocentric sustainability city as machine nature for the benefit of human beings economic growth elite power personal freedom Urban EcoTheohgy, p. 17. The map points up some of the cultural contradictions of our present situation, and underlines the need for a fundamental cultural and spiritual shift. 77 K. Sale, Human Scale (London: Seeker &amp; Warburg, 1980), pp. 38, 59. principle, that for every animal, object, institution or system there is an optimal limit beyond which it ought not to grow. And its corollary, that beyond this optimal size all other aspects of a system will be affected adversely.78 An obvious alternative is to argue for small scale developments based on permaculture. Castells\u2019 comment on such proposals is that \u2018[t]he ecological dream of small, quasi rural communes will be pushed away to counter cultural marginality by the historical tide of megacity development\u2019. \u2018There will be epidemics and disintegration of social control... but megacities will grow in size and dominance because they keep feeding themselves on population, wealth, power and innovators from their extended hinterland. They are nodal points connecting to global networks.\u201979 This proposal, however, seems quite as impossible as the small scale developments he dismisses. Although earlier he has examined Green movements, Castells does not ask at this stage of his work whether this historical tide is either ecologically or socially sustainable. He seems to presuppose the arguments of those economists, like Julian Simon, who maintain that human inventiveness will always come up with something, and then use this as an argument that human beings can do as they please.80 The record of extinct civilisations ought to warn us of the dangers of such folly. Radical utopian alternatives are proposed by the Greek thinker Constantin Doxiadis, and the American Paolo Soleri. Doxiadis assumed that the human population would go on expanding up to 22 billion. This, he believed, was the absolute limit of the earth\u2019s carrying capacity, and would only be possible if we stopped building on fertile agricultural soil at once (this was in the 1970s). He distinguished four basic spatial areas: one for nature, another for cultivation, another for human living and another for industry. He then broke these up into twelve zones beginning with a zone which was \u2018as nearly virgin as possible\u2019, then one visited by humans but without permanent human installations, up to an industrial area which was the site of\u2018every possible use for achieving the goal of the best industrialisation\u2019. Looking at the planet he saw a coastline of approximately 261,000 kilometres, and proposed that the areafor human settlement should consist of low, medium and high density settlements 7 8 Victor Papanek agrees. \u2018My primary conviction as a human being a designer and an ecologist is Nothing Big Works Ever!'Green Imperative, p. 24. 79 M.

Simon, The Ultimate Resource (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981). following this coastline, globally.81 Since Doxiadis\u2019 death in 1975 global warming has made a significant impact on world coastlines, leading Paul Ehrlich to suggest that coastal zone development should be limited as far as possible.82 Paolo Soleri has proposed housing people in vast structures which are mini cities in themselves. \u2018Around vertical vectors\u2019, he writes, \u2018megalopoly and suburbia can contract.\u2019 As with Le Corbusier the idea is that one can step out from the high rise building into the countryside. His towers are surrounded by greenhouses which both grow food and channel heat into the settlement. Within the settlement transport is eliminated altogether. His image of these vast structures is of great passenger liners, afloat in the global sea, his version of the \u2018machine for living in\u2019. Like Teilhard de Chardin, his inspiration, he envisages human beings evolving from nature to neonature, partly through the structures of his \u2018arcology\u2019 (architecture plus ecology). High density is central to his thinking. In his view \u2018death comes when the system uncrowds. No eco thinking can ignore the miracle of crowded living.\u2019 The fate of tower blocks seems to be the best commentary on his proposals.83 Vance proposed that there has always been an alternative to synoecism (the process by which villages come together to form a city, as proposed by Aristotle), namely what he called diocecism, in which cities dispersed into their rural hinterlands.84 Some have proposed that Information Technology will reverse the movement of the first industrial revolution. Bill Gates, of Microsoft, believes that there are now 7 million telecommuters in the United States, significantly reducing pressures on traffic. They could, of course, simply lead to what Hall calls \u2018telesprawl\u2019, a further undisciplined spread of suburbia.85 Counter urbanisation is in part a flight from the mega city, and represents a perception that vast communities are not socially sustainable. This trend, however, is so far only visible in the North, and the cities of the South continue to grow a rate of 20 million a year, so that the planet grows steadily more urban. The push and pull factors which account for this are well known, and include land degradation first and foremost, along with the promise of higher incomes, freedom from the constraints of traditional societies, and greater access to health care and education. As the pressure on the 81 C. Doxiadis, Ecology and Elastics (London: Elek, 1977). 82 Foreword to R. Samuels and D.

If utopian visions and growing suburbanisation seem no solution, others look for specifically city shaped solutions. Many put their faith in the compact city, which will, it is argued, reduce ecological footprints because of more efficient land use and transport.1 The argument is that they reduce travel distances, save rural land from development, and support local facilities. Hedley Smyth claims that the history of the compact city can be traced back to biblical times when a range of government functions were administered at the city gate, controlling the comings and goings in and out of the city as well as defending it against attack.2 Thomas Sharp, who, as we have seen, already argued for compact cities in 1932, was inspired by the old English towns, and in a similar way European thinking draws on the model of the densely developed core of the Italian hill city. An example of compact city theory in practice is the fourth report on physical planning in the Netherlands, On the Road to 2015. This proposes to concentrate residences, work areas and amenities so as to produce the shortest possible trip distances, most being possible by bicycle and public transport. Work is arranged so that those sites with the most workers are located close to city centre stations; hospitals, research and white collar work are situated near a good station and with good access to motorways; and work which needs high accessibility by car or truck and has relatively few workers is situated close to motorways.3 This is a reverse of the movement of suburbanisation, where people chose to live as far from the workplace as they conveniently could. In this kind of strategy cities are seen not only as the source of the problem, but also as the means of solving it, and the general objective of achieving sustainability is seen as dependent not on radical utopian schemes but on producing sustainable built environments from the cities and towns already in existence, by steering rather than overnight radical change.4 The compact city idea, however, is not without its problems. Some argue that it meets neither energy efficiency nor economic demands, and that it lacks the popular or political support to make it workable.5 1 M. Wackernagel and W. Rees, Our Ecological Footprint (Gabriola Island: New Society, 1996), p. 103. 2 8: H. Smyth, \u2018Running the Gauntlet\u2019, in M. Jenks, E. Burton and K.

Others doubt that it meets the demands of the contemporary workplace and challenge the findings on transport, at the same time pointing out that crowded conditions often do not enhance the quality of life and noisy neighbours are a prominent cause of disputes and even murder!91 Smyth argues that many will come to live in a transition zone because of continuing displacement as a result of urban renewal and gentrihcation which will then displace lower income groups. This is, in fact, something already well evidenced in London. The result, he argues, will be that this zone will become a doughnut of social disadvantage around the compact city. In the worst analysis this could even be an example of eco fascism.92 Against those who propose town cramming are those who say that it is vital for urban dwellers to be put back in touch with \u2018nature\u2019 and that we need space for urban farms, orchards and neighbourhood gardens.93 If sustainability is the new religion, argues Tim Mars, then planners are its priests, and the compact city the new Jerusalem. \u2018It sounds plausible and seductive but it is a chimera. In environmental terms even compact cities are hardly benign.\u201994 If the compact city has a finite capacity then it is not on its own a true, long term, sustainable solution.95 The case for the compact city, then, \u2018remains largely unresolved\u2019.96 Perhaps this is true, but ongoing suburban sprawl, or megalopolis, is even less benign, and for this reason it is widely accepted that medium sized cities, at least, are not only part of the problem, but also a key part of the solution to the environmental crisis, assuming that there is a solution. Many argue that cities are the most environmentally sustainable way of housing people and providing factories, offices, shops, leisure facilities and many of the other things that society wants.97 Harley Sherlock even concludes that to prevent pollution in the twenty first century most of us will have to live in cities.98 Travel in cities is less energy consuming than in small towns and rural areas, because journey lengths are shorter, so people can walk and cycle more. Some planners hope that well designed and well managed cities can reduce travel 91 Ibid., pp. 53ff., and K. Williams, E. Burton and M.

A whole raft of practical proposals is available to move in this direction, and have been implemented in various parts of the world. In Stockholm, Stuttgart and Helsinki inner city combined heat and power stations are in use, which greatly reduce damaging emissions and both produce hot water and generate electricity. Recycling and reuse programmes are being introduced in many cities: Stockholm recycles 80 per cent of all aluminium cans, and in Denmark the use of \u2018one way\u2019 plastic bottles is banned; in China human waste has traditionally been used as fertiliser, and ways of using rather than \u2018disposing\u2019 of sewage, let alone dumping it in the sea, need to be found; a new sewage processing system which demands far less water and avoids the use of chlorine has been developed in Australia and is now in use from Japan to Britain. As Herbert Girardet emphasises, cities, which use between two thirds and three quarters of fossil fuels world wide, need to take responsibility for their biocidic processes. In order for the waste gases they produce to be absorbed through photo synthesis cities need to nurture forests as \u2018symbiotic partners\u2019 to ensure climatic stability. Achieving this, as he says, means making commitments on a global scale.3 As the debate around the Bush administration\u2019s attitude to climate change makes clear, culture change underlies the adoption of such practical proposals. To have an ecological city structure we have to have what Kjellberg calls ecological citizenship, based on values which have internalised the ecological question.102 1 Haughton and Hunter, Sustainable Cities, pp. 12 13; G.

A related set of proposals are urban villages linked by light transit systems: already Munich, Freiburg, Stockholm, Vancouver, and Washington DC have such networks. The key aspect of such villages are mixed land use, with commercial and residential properties in together; high density, with everything within walking or cycling distance; extensive landscaping, including roof top gardens; good provision for children and for the community in the form of libraries, child care, centres for the elderly, and perhaps small urban farms, and as high a degree of self sufficiency for the community as possible.

THE FUTURE OF THE CITY In a widely accepted piece of analysis Saskia Sassen speaks of the emergence of global cities. She claims that the combination of spatial dispersal and global integration has created a new strategic role for major cities which function in four new ways: as command points in the organisation of the world economy; as key locations for finance; as sites of production and innovations; and as markets for these. What we have in cities such as New York, London and Tokyo is a new type of city, for which the earth is its hinterland.1 The structure of the business and finance centres, the magnitude of them, and the weight in the economies of these cities are what have changed. The power wielded by these cities, Sassen suggests, calls the primacy of the nation state into question. The interactions among them in terms of finance and investment suggest they may be a system. The sharp concentrations of such activities constitute internationalised spaces at the heart of these large, basically domestic, urban areas.2 The waning of the power of the state is both a threat and a promise. It is a promise for distinct cultural regions, long dominated by powerful neighbours: Scotland and the Basque country, for example. It is a threat when its disintegration leads to murderous Balkanisation as in Yugoslavia. In this new situation Castells, somewhat surprisingly, puts all the weight on the family. He envisages a situation where people are \u2018disaffected from the crumbling institutions of civil society\u2019 and individualised in their work and lives. In such a situation, in his view, the reconstructed family will be the only security in a dangerous sea. \u2018Families are more than ever the providers of pyschological security and material wellbeing to people in a world characterized by individuation of work, destructuring of civil society and delegitimation of the state.\u2019105 But families only exist as elements in larger cultural units, speaking particular languages, cooking in particular ways, forming kinship groups thus and not otherwise. Pentecost is not the obliteration of regional diversity, but the situation where we learn to understand one another, and confess, in our manifold ways, the wonderful giftedness of all things. And in a world of the decline of old nationalisms the region is the site of struggle, not only against the old centres of power, but also against the homogenising cultural power of multi nationals and of the global media. Traditional cultures are under threat all over the world, impacted by the new media 1 S. Sassen, The Global City (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991), pp. 3\u20144. 2 Ibid., p. 169. 105 M. Castells, End of Millennium (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), p. 349. technologies.106 The family cannot resist such cultural trends. What is needed is a new affirmation of regional power, if not of the nation state as known during the twentieth century. Braudel argues that the great cities of the medieval and early modern periods \u2018produced the modern states, an enormous task requiring an enormous effort. They mark a turning point in world history. They produced the national markets, without which the modern state would be a pure fiction.\u2019107 Perhaps the global city will give birth to a new world order. Alternatively, ecological demands could ensure that cities once again have to find their resources in their immediate regions.108 Harvey agrees that respecting the diversity of the local environment is a key aspect of the human future. \u2018The richness of human capacity for complexity and diversity\u2019 has to be understood in the context of \u2018the free exploration of the richness, complexity, and diversity encountered in the rest of nature\u2019, and above all in the region.109 What Geddes, Norberg Schulz and others argue about the relation of city and region instantiates Aristotle\u2019s tenet that respect for limits is a key part of creativity. If this is the case then the emergence of the global city could ultimately be stultifying. The acid test of the city\u2019s role in the economy of redemption is precisely the question of what the city does for the poor qua city. In Engel\u2019s city, the city of dreadful night, the poor just disappeared and died, often enough bereft of all support. Examples of this can be found even in the cities of the North, for all their welfare systems, even at the beginning of the twenty first century. To this extent there is a judgement on the city. It is, however, the urban poor who tell us that this is not the whole story. To concentrate only on judgement is to allow too little place for the I0\u00ae R. Barnet and J. Cavanagh, \u2018Homogenization of Global Culture\u2019, in J. Mander and E. Goldsmith (eds.), The Case against the Global Economy (San Francisco: Sierra Club, 1996), pp. 71 ff. Speaking to village activists in Tamil Nadu in 1994 I was told that in the evenings now, rather than telling stories, dancing and singing songs, the whole community sits round and watches western porno videos. 107 F. Braudel, The Structures of Everyday Life (London: Collins, 1981), p. 527. I0^ Folke Gunther argues this, for example, believing that cities need to rediscover their dependence on their agricultural hinterland and develop this.

Harvey Justice, Mature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 202. There is no need to accept unsustainable cities as fate. In particular the present environmental costs of transport mean that it is still essential for cities to respect their regions. Geddes and Mumford argued that it was vital for cities not to turn them into specialised machines for producing a single kind of goods \u2014 wheat, trees, coal. To forget the many sided potentialities which a region has as a habitat for organic life is to unsettle and make precarious any economic life at all. Historically we know that some of the greatest ancient cities died because they failed to respect this relationship. ongoing creativity of the Spirit of God. As with the other forms of the built environment we have to allow that the city too must \u2018die to sin\u2019, to its city pride, to its unsustainable consumption of resources, to its marginalisation of the poor. On the other hand it may be that if we recover and respect our limits the city may remain the focus of human creativity, the place where the Spirit of God is known most intensely, and this is known in the vivacity, warmth and mutual support of many poor urban communities. To do this it requires focus. Speaking of the new urban developments in the United States, which he calls Edge City, Joel Garreau notes that the shopping mall is the new spiritual centre, and that \u2018there is apparently no reason for any \u201cceremonial centres\u201d dedicated to a \u201clife more abundant\u201d to be at the core of Edge City\u2019.00 This development signifies the loss of the transcendent question about where we are going and what we are for. \u2018As we collectively produce our cities\u2019, writes David Harvey, \u2018so we collectively produce ourselves. Projects concerning what we want our cities to be are, therefore, projects concerning human possibilities, who we want, or, perhaps even more pertinently, who we do not want to become.\u20191 2 Cities have always been about markets, pleasure, deifyingthe human project. But the great religious monuments of the past have both challenged this, pointing to a justice to which human societies should aspire, and sublimated it, turning wealth and enterprise into miracles of corporate endeavour. Lack of transcendent purpose in the city is not an absolutely new phenomenon. If Mumford is right, the Hellenistic city effectively built to celebrate its own achievements, as did imperial Rome. This ought to be a warning to us, for today we wander about in their ruins. For what gave a new lease of life to Rome was Christianity without which, at several points in the past two millennia, it would probably not have survived. Cities necessarily have markets; they are centres of the arts and of innovation. But without a creative spirituality, a sense of transcendent purpose, they die, they cease to be cities in the true sense. Perhaps it was because he wrote in the milieu of the Hellenistic city and of imperial Rome that the author of Hebrews insisted that \u2018here we have no lasting city, but look for the city that is to come\u2019 (Heb. 13.14). With regard to the cities that he knew, he was right, for imperial ambitions, whether 1 Garreau, Edge City, p. 65. 2 D. Harvey, Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 159. Gf. Mumford\u2019s remark that precisely because cities were part of the humanising process they were formed \u2018not by necessity but by discipline, desire and design\u2019 City, p. 127). colonial or neo colonial, are no substitute for transcendent purpose. He would be right, too, about Edge City. But here, too, perhaps, we can learn from the past. For it was in those very cities that Paul preached and faith communities took root which, as Peter Brown shows, sustained the city through the dark ages when the city almost died in the West, and after that once more gave it purpose. Socialism, says David Harvey, \u2018needs must arm itself with concepts and ideas, ideals and imaginaries... with foundational beliefs and persuasive arguments if it is to go about its task effectively\u2019.1 These concepts and ideas, ideals and imaginaries sound pretty much how the author of Hebrews describes the faith which takes us into the future. Such faith stands at the heart of the survival and shaping of the city as a key part of God\u2019s economy of redemption. 1 Harvey, Justice, p. 434. Constructing community Jerusalem built as a city that is bound firmly together. (Psalm 122.3) If we are dreaming of Eden it is probable that we are dreaming of community. Anthropologists tell us that the group antedates the family and that the human capacity for living in community stems from the fact that only through communal efforts can they survive. Because the hunter gatherer way of life lasted several hundred thousand years, argues Ren\u00e9 Dubos, it has left an indelible stamp on human behaviour. Since the genetic determinants of human behaviour have evolved in small groups, \u2018modern man still has a biological need to be part of community\u2019.1 If there is truth in these claims, it would explain why the search for workable forms of community occupies such a large role in human history. A community is a group of people who have something in common, but what? Throughout history this has included the idea of territory, and territory, I will argue, remains important, even in an age of migration and of identity politics. However, territorially based notions of community are challenged by class, caste, gender, and ethnic divisions because community is also rooted in religion, culture, language, ethnicity, work or ideas. That idea that it is not territory which has primacy but shared interests and values is not an invention of the twentieth century but was alive in first century Galatia, and indeed in Egypt under the Pharaohs. Hardly surprising then that \u2018alternative\u2019 communities go back at least to the Essenes in the first century, and run through Benedict, Bernard of Clairvaux, Francis and Dominic, the Anabaptists, and Robert Owen, to the communes and base communities of the late twentieth century. All of these represent attempts to find the way back to the Garden of harmonious community. In G. Doxiadis (ed.), Anthropopolis (New York: Norton, 1974), pp. 259 tio. Though the quest for community is ancient, it assumed a new intensity in the wake of industrialisation, which has involved, amongst other things, the dissolution of the small rooted communities which human beings had lived in for millennia, and their replacement by the anonymous city. These changes were theorised by Frederick Tonnies in 1877 in terms of the distinction between Gemeinschaft roughly, the community of the village, based on mutual aid and trust, and centred on family, neighbourhood and friendship and Gesellschaft, the association of the anonymous city, based on individual self interest and contract.1 He believed that true community was only possible in the former. Though subjected to vigorous criticism from the start, not least by Durkheim, his distinction has proved remarkably resilient. Rather on the lines of the \u2018God of the gaps\u2019 the Church has often seen its role in the light of this analysis as providing some glimmer of community where otherwise it is absent. In many respects the churches achieve a great deal in this way, and I shall argue that the Christian understanding of community is paradigmatic for human community as a whole. At the end of the nineteenth century Christian Trusts, like the Peabody Trust, and priests in slum areas, were also involved in the attempt to create physical environments conducive to community. It is this attempt I want to focus on in this chapter. Already at the beginning of the nineteenth century Robert Owen had believed that it was possible to fashion community through building, a belief later shared, ironically, by Margaret Thatcher. Patrick Geddes believed in \u2018the vast modihcability of life through its surroundings\u2019.2 In this process a romanticised vision of Gemeinschaft played a key role. \u2018Romanticism\u2019 should not be taken wholly as a term of abuse here. It emerged as a protest against what industrialisation was doing to the world, human beings and human community, and many of its products, like the craft work of William Morris, or the town and estate plans of Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker in Hampstead, New Earswick and Letchworth, remain inspirational. Certainly it was immensely superior to what was produced by the reassertion of the reigning ethos of capitalism, utilitarianism, both in the years between the two world wars and in the two decades after the second. Whether produced by developers or by the public sector the emphasis was on cheapness at the expense of quality, and above all imagination. Public sector estates in particular became \u2018anonymous and intimidating environments, the dumping 1 F. Tonnies, Community and Society, tr. C. Loomis (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1963). 2 Cited in G. Jones, Social Darwinism and English Thought (Brighton: Harvester, 1980), p. 71. ground for those who were found surplus to society\u2019s requirements\u2019.1 In the 1950s Wilmott and Young\u2019s famous study of the East End of London found that the intense community produced by slum conditions was lost in the transition to new council estates, a process further intensified by the passion for tower blocks of the 1960s. The failure of many of these schemes kept the demand to \u2018build community\u2019 on the agenda, but by the end of the century visions of Gemeinschaji had faded. Against any cosy image of community postmodernism insisted on the priority of difference. Instead of taking the positive value of community for granted, as Unwin and Parker had been able to do, people now talked of the \u2018myth\u2019 of community which pressures those who do not conform to leave or at least know their place.2 This critique, taken together with a burgeoning individualism in almost every sphere of life, meant that at the end of the century, the \u2018consensus across disciplines\u2019 was that \u2018community\u2019 as an objective had become less relevant in describing societies in the developed world.3 According to Zygmunt Bauman what took the place of the old Gemeinschaji was a neo tribal world, where the tribes are formed by a multitude of individual acts of self identification. Such agencies as might from time to time emerge to hold the faithful together have limited executive power and little control over co optation or banishment... \u2018Membership\u2019 is relatively easily revocable, and is divorced from long term obligations... Tribes \u2018exist\u2019 solely by individual decisions to sport the symbolic traits of tribal allegiance. They vanish once the decisions are revoked or their determination fades out. They persevere thanks only to their continuing seductive capacity. They cannot oudive their power of attraction.4 \u2018Community\u2019 in this world is a collection of individual consumers, who might change their preference from week to week. If Bauman\u2019s analysis is right, this poses a major political problem, for what holds the sub cultures competing for the scarce resource of space together if there is no \u2018meta narrative\u2019 of \u2018Community\u2019 in relation to the myriad different communities which make up society? One of the obvious answers the nation was deeply discredited in the course of the twentieth century, and the ethnic cleansing of the closing decade discredited it still further. Life in what Castles and Miller have called \u2018the age of migration\u2019 makes 1 M. Smith, J. Whiteleg and N. Williams, Greening the Built Environment (London: Earthscan, 1998), p. 170. 2 3 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greenings p. 161. 4 Z. Bauman, Modernity and Ambivalence (Cambridge: Polity, 1989), p. 249, summarising the account of \u2018neo tribalism\u2019 of Michel Maffesoli. it still more difficult, for ethnic and religious loyalties cut right across territorial ones.1 But what then takes its place? One thing the whole discussion makes clear is that both the meaning of community, and therefore the task of fashioning it, remain an unsolved problem. In turn that leaves a black hole at the bottom of planning theory, in effect filled by the demands of competitive individualism. For unless land is plentiful, as in New Zealand for example, simply proliferating individual houses built at the owners\u2019 whim is no option. Some common understanding of community is demanded. By way of seeing what has been, and is, understood by community I shall look at various forms of built environment, before turning to examine what our understanding of Church as community has to contribute to meeting this dilemma. THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY \u2018Every state is a community of some kind, and every community is established with a view to some good.\u2019 This is how Aristotle begins the Politics. He thinks of community in terms of a series of building blocks beginning with the family. The family is the association \u2018established by nature\u2019 for the supply of everyday wants. \u2018But when several families are united, and the association aims at something more than the supply of daily needs, the first society to be formed is the village.\u2019 An association of villages is, as we have already seen, a city.2 Aristotle\u2019s distinction between family and village corresponds to the pattern W. Williams found in Eskdale as recently as the 1950s. In the village, said Williams, patterns of friendliness and cooperation follow lines of physical proximity; in the countryside (by which he meant remote farms), new neighbours may be bypassed for more distant kin and traditional partners. In the village, community is formed by face to face contact and by gossip whilst the farm wife had to rely on her husband and sons to bring her news of neighbours and kin.3 On the farm, then, at that stage, community meant the family. Doubtless the advent of car and phone signalled an imminent change even there. The village, with its \u2018patterns of friendliness and cooperation\u2019, is clearly what Tonnies had in mind by Gemeinschqft. One of the most perfect pictures of it in English is Mary Mitford\u2019s Our Village, a series of sketches published in the Lady\u2019s Magazine between 1822 and 1827. She writes: 1 S. Castles and M. Miller, The Age of Migration (London: Macmillan, 2nd edn, 1998). 2 Politics 1252. 3 W. Williams, The Sociology of an English Village: Gosforth (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, i956)&gt; ch 7 Of all situations for a constant residence, that which appears to me most delightful is a litde village far in the country; a small neighbourhood, not of fine mansions finely peopled, but of cottages and cottage like houses... with inhabitants whose faces are as familiar to us as the flowers in our garden; a little world of our own, dose packed and insulated like ants in an ant hill... where we know every one, are known to every one, interested in every one, and authorized to hope that every one feels an interest in us.\" It could come out of a children\u2019s story book, but Three Mile Cross was a real place. Community here is the knowable circle, those we can practically aid, or expect to seek help from.Three Mile Cross had, on Mitford\u2019s account, a strong sense of identity, especially fostered by competitive games with neighbouring villages. Here is her account of preparation for the village cricket game (and this was written long before cricket became a national, let alone a middle class or professional, sport): There is something strangely delightful in the innocent spirit of party. To be one of a numerous body, to be authorized to say we, to have a rightful interest in triumph or defeat, is gratifying at once to social feeling and to personal pride. There was not a ten year old urchin, or a septuagenary woman in the parish who did not feel an additional importance, a reflected consequence, in speaking of\u2018our side\u2019. An election interests in the same way; but that feeling is less pure. Money is there, and hatred, and politics and lies. Oh, to be a voter, or a voter\u2019s wife, comes nothing near the genuine and hearty sympathy of belonging to a parish, breathing the same air, looking on the same trees, listening to the same nightingales! Talk of a patriotic elector! Give me a patriotic patriot, a man who loves his parish!1 2 What makes Mitford\u2019s record significant is that she does not write as one of the gentry, nor as an observer, but as a villager herself who struggled with genteel poverty for most of her life. The villagers of whom she writes are common labourers and the gentry only appear on the margins. But the idyllic picture she paints, we remind ourselves, comes from the period of enclosures, not long before Captain Swing. And Mitford is a contemporary of Jane Austen for whom, as Raymond Williams puts it, the countryside is either weather or a place for a walk and \u2018neighbours\u2019 are the next big house.13 We have, then, a class society, where amity is preserved so long as people know their place. And seeing that people kept their place was a ruthless priority. \u2018The use of common land by labourers operates on the mind as a sort of independence,\u2019 said a Report on Shropshire, in 1794. For this reason the commons should be enclosed for then \u2018the labourers will work every day in the year, their children 1 M. Mitford, Our Village (London: Harrap, 1947), p. 12. 12 Ibid., p. 120. 2 13 R. Williams, The Country and the City (London: Hogarth, 1985), p. 166. will be put out to labour early... and that subordination of the lower orders of Society, which in the present times is so much wanted would be thereby considerably secured\u2019.1 The class war which was in fact in progress is visible in Mitford only in the shape of deference. It is clearer in the report of the Liberal MP E. N. Bennett, writing eighty years after Mitford, who found that in organising village games, there were always two main obstacles: \u2018the men are too tired after their long hours of work to indulge in further exercise... and they are usually too poor to pay even a small subscription with regularity\u2019.2 And it was class and deference which, in Bennett\u2019s time, effectively stymied the attempt to activate local democracy through the setting up of Parish Meetings and Parish Councils.3 This attempt was important, however, as recognition of the fact that \u2018community\u2019 does not just happen, is not part of what Aristotle would call \u2018nature\u2019, but needs structures, and is a vital part of the political process of a free society. Aside from class, the village was also a place where received morality was strictly and even savagely enforced. Alwyn Rees cites a Welsh village in the mid twentieth century, where a middle aged widow was being visited at night by a young lad, and the youth group blamed the widow for enticing him. \u2018To break up the association they congregated around the house of the widow every time the lad was there, stopping up the chimney and throwing dead vermin and other obnoxious objects in through the door and windows. \u2019 In another district a married man having an affair was met by the youth group on his way home, plastered with cowdung and dragged through the river.'4 It is essentially the picture of the Skimmington Ride in Hardy\u2019s Mayor of Casterbridge. Research in 1994 in two very small Welsh villages found that traditional ideas of domestic ity and of \u2018a woman\u2019s place\u2019 were very strong. One of the interviewees commented: \u2018You have to work hard to prove yourself, to feel you belong. There is a lot of pressure, whereas in the city... you don\u2019t have to make such an effort. You have to conform to expectations or they will gossip about you.\u20195 1 E. N.

Little (eds.), Contested Countryside Cultures: Otherness, marginalisation and rurality (London: Routledge, 1977), p. 131. In Lark Rise to Candleford Flora Thompson talks of the way a couple involved in adultery were policed by the Skimmington Ride, but otherwise the community she depicts was very accepting of pregnancy out of wedlock and many forms of social difference. It was hardest on snobbery. Coercion of a different kind is involved in the pseudo villages created here and there in the United States at the end of the twentieth century. In Celebration, Florida, a Disney village of 20,000 people, with weather boarded houses and white picket fences, there are rules about colour of curtains, the nature of the shrubbery in the front gardens, and what you can work on in the street. As Leonie Sandercock rightly observes, this represents an attempt to turn away from the challenges of the present, and return to an imagined pre industrial golden age of extended families living in small villages which fails to acknowledge the difficulties and injustices of that society.19 These facts call in question the common assertion that traditional villages are \u2018built for community\u2019. This has been argued on the grounds that class and occupation were mixed indiscriminately throughout the village, avoiding the monoculture of housing estates, that the village depended on the active cooperation of all classes, but especially because the vast majority were engaged in activities which were closely related to each other and there was therefore a community of interest.20 But class mix often fractures rather than unites community.21 The old community of the village was founded on a deference which was actually a forced acknowledgement of an essentially feudal power.22 Today, the advance of communication technology, and the depopulation of the countryside as farming has become dominated by agribusiness and lost its demand for labour, has \u2018reproduced in rural areas an individualized and home centred social life similar to that found in the suburbs\u2019.23 The same could be said of fishing villages whilst in Britain at least mining villages have virtually ceased to exist. The key change in the disintegration of the old village is not so much a shift in the structure of feeling but the loss of local industry, and therefore of common tasks. Where villages become commuter dormitories, or settlements for the retired, no resemblance to Mitford\u2019s village could possibly be expected. In some there are splits Sandercock, Towards Cosmopolis, p. 194. 20 W. P. Baker, The English Village (London: Oxford University Press, 1953), pp 76\u20147. 21 This is illustrated in a ludicrous way in Oxford by the notorious \u2018Cutteslowe wall\u2019. When council houses were built abutting a middle class suburb in North Oxford in the 1930s the residents defended themselves by erecting a wall. In 1999 an attempt at mixed community in North London likewise foundered when the middle class developments found it \u2018necessary\u2019 to gate their flats, causing intense resentment on the part of adjacent council tenants. 22 In 1999 the son of the Head Gardener to the Duke of Somerset recalled how his father had always referred to his employer as \u2018Your Grace\u2019. When, as a 13 year old, he challenged this practice, he was told angrily: \u2018Keep quiet, boy! You\u2019ll lose me my job!\u2019 (personal conversation, September 1999) 23 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greenings p. 168. 170 A Theology of the Bulk Environment between \u2018incomers\u2019 and older residents, often accentuated by the construction of estates which break up the fabric of the old village and invite segregation. Where villages are used as dormitories the emphasis is on the family rather than the community. Churches in particular often try to engender a sense of community through events in which as many people as possible are involved, but it is an open question whether sufficiently sustained community of interest can be generated to produce the \u2018local patriotism\u2019 Mary Mitford so enjoyed. The key to this sense seems to be shared weal and woe, shared fate. The recovery of a diversity of trades in the village could lead in this direction, but even then it would be in strong tension with the West\u2019s reigning individualism. THE CITY COMMUNITY The influence of Tonnies\u2019 distinctions is so widespread that when we say \u2018community\u2019 many automatically think \u2018village\u2019. In the ancient world and in medieval Europe the opposite was the case. According to Aristotle it was the city which was the paradigm community, though his city was, of course, quite small. Plato recommended that a city should contain 5,040 heads of households about 35,000 to 40,000 people. Aristotle thought the limit was \u2018the largest number which can be taken in at a single view\u2019, which is probably much the same size. The problem of keeping numbers stable was solved by colonisation, the first practical recognition, as Mumford says, of an organic limit to city growth. The Greek city\u2019s real strength, he felt, was that it embodied the doctrine of the golden mean and was neither too small nor too big, neither too rich nor poor. Thus \u2018it kept the human personality from being dwarfed by its own collective products, whilst fully utilizing all the urban agents of cooperation and communion\u2019.1 Today, it is argued, cities are not communities but \u2018staging posts, providing leisure facilities, hotels, restaurants, business meetings; and their outer edges act as the setting for home centred activities. In the electronic age the centuries old rationale for cities is vanishing.\u20192 To this every city dweller at once responds that cities are agglomerations of urban villages, and that community remains alive and well in the village. This is not quite true, for the inhabitant of Greenwich village remains a New Yorker, of Camden a Londoner, of Belleville a Parisian. All the same, the sub communities which genuinely make up the city, as 1 L. Mumford, The City in History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p. 174. 2 D. M. Hill, Citizens and Cities (New York: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1994), p. 243, summarising a view rather than representing her own. opposed to its suburbs, do remain in all sorts of ways for good and for ill. As Harvey points out, much contemporary concern for community is targeted on the affluent whilst leaving the underclass to their fate.1 It was early recognised that it was the community, and not the built environment, which makes the city. \u2018It is not well roofed houses, well built walls, docks and harbours which constitute a city\u2019, said Alcaeus, \u2018but men ready to use their own opportunity.\u20192 Amongst the free citizens it is the common pursuit of justice and the good life which constitute the community for Aristotle. In this community all the free citizens could meet to discuss affairs. Accordingly, at the heart of the city was the agora, essentially an open space at the centre of the city\u2019s street system which served as the political, religious, social and economic focal point of the community.3 From this, of course, slaves, women and strangers were all excluded. The idea that \u2018[t]he city makes one free\u2019, mentioned in the previous chapter, represents what the city stood for in the middle ages, when it allowed an escape from the oppression of feudal bonds. Kropotkin argued that in the twelfth century there occurred a \u2018communalist\u2019 revolution in Europe which saved its culture from suppression by theocratic and despotic monarchies. This revolution expressed itself in the local village community and in urban fraternities and guilds. In the later medieval city each section or parish was the province of an individual self governing guild; and the city was the union of these districts, streets, parishes and guilds. These achievements, he argued, were swept away by the centralised state of the sixteenth century.4 Mumford depicted the medieval city as \u2018a collective structure whose main purpose was the livingofa Christian life\u2019. Hospitals and almshouses were built to serve the sick and needy, as, later on, were foundling asylums. \u2018The lay orders, aiming at the practice of a Christian life in the heart of the city without the physical and spiritual withdrawal enjoined by the old monasteries, were part of an organized effort to infuse every aspect of existence with Christian principles.\u201930 In this city the monopoly of power and knowledge was renounced and laws and property rights reorganised in the interest ofjustice. Slavery and compulsory labour were abolished, and gross economic inequalities between class and class eliminated.31 More plausibly Richard Sennett talks of the way in which the religious 1 D.

Owens, The City in the Greek and Roman World (London: Routledge, 1991). 3 Owens, City, p. 153. 4 P. Hall, Cities of Tomorrow (Oxford: Blackwell, 1988), p. 144. 4 3 \u00b0 Mumford, City, p. 345. 31 Ibid., p. 364. community in the medieval city served as a point of moral reference. The almshouse, the parish church, and the hospital set standards against which to measure behaviour in other parts of the city. \u2018It made a city a moral geography. For those under the sway of the new religious values sanctuary was the point of community \u2014 a place where compassion bonded strangers.\u20191 Girouard reminds us of much that was oppressive in this idealised city. He focuses on the complex and often chaotic power structure, and the imperative to orthodoxy. That the clergy were exempt from civil law meant that there were thousands of people outside that law. The impression of unity was almost always deceptive and almost all medieval towns were dominated by a lay or ecclesiastical ruler. The middle ages witnessed a slow power struggle which ended in the sixteenth century patriciate.2 Furthermore, the orthodoxy of the medieval town, like that of the village, was deeply oppressive. There was little room for dissent. It was generally accepted that there were right beliefs and right ways of behaving and any deviation from these was punishable. The city was a hierarchy, divided into ascending levels, and although movement from one level to the other was not impossible it was not encouraged. Those on each level were expected to look and behave in a particular way, and not to act or dress above their stations. An inspection of medieval legal documents shows that they abound with regulations about dress and behaviour. In Florence wedding menus had to be checked in advance; in Siena in 1425 women were forbidden to wear silk clothes or a train or clothes which accentuated their figures. In Nuremberg workmen were fined for parting their hair in a forbidden manner. Even amongst the wealthy ostentation in dress or lifestyle was discouraged and often legally regulated. The merchants, as much as everyone else... accepted an ethos of thrift, sobriety and hard work. Work hours were regulated by bell... They ran from sunrise to sunset, with an hour off for midday meal. In Nuremberg the shortest working day was seven hours, the longest thirteen. All towns had a curfew, imposed at dusk, after which it was forbidden to walk about the city except on lawful business.3 The coming of industrialisation meant that for the first time cities of millions sprang up. This change of scale was in the first instance a 1 R. Sennett, Flesh and Stone (London: Faber, 1994), p. 159. 2 M. Girouard, Cities and People: A Social and Architectural History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985), P 47 3 Ibid., p. 73. product of early industrial technology, for steam required that the parts of a plant could not be more than a quarter of a mile from the source of power. It was this city that generated the anomie and alienation which Durkheim analysed and which led to a flight from the city into suburbia, or the search for alternatives from Robert Owen\u2019s New Lanark onwards. The vision of people like Ebenezer Howard, the founding father of the Garden City, and of Mumford\u2019s mentor Patrick Geddes was, writes Peter Hall, \u2018not merely of an alternative built form, but of an alternative society, neither capitalistic nor bureaucratic socialistic: a society based on voluntary co operation among men and women, working and living in small self governing commonwealths\u2019.1 The great English town planner Raymond Unwin likewise dreamed of voluntary self governing communities. His Garden Cities were vehicles for the progressive reconstruction of capitalist society into a network of cooperative commonwealths.2 To a certain extent, Peter Hall argues, this vision was realised in the strong city hall politics of many British cities in the twentieth century, though apathy and disillusion with politics, alongside well publicised city hall corruption, has weakened the genuine democratic base. In the United States the Settlement house movement likewise argued that the time had come for \u2018a great renewal of confidence in the vitality of neighbourhoods as a political and moral unit\u2019.3 Anticipating Jane Jacobs they recommended the community block as a powerful social force. At the end of the Second World War the Goodmans agreed: Starting from being neighbours, meeting on the street, and sharing community domestic services (laundry, nursery, school) the residents become conscious of their common interests... Where there is a sense of neighbourhood, proposals are initiated for the local good; and this can come to the immensely desirable result of a political unit intermediary between the families and the faceless civic authority... Such face to face agencies, exerting their influence for schools, zoning, play streets, a sensible solution for problems of transit and traffic, would soon make an end of isolated plans for \u2018housing\u2019.38 A very different option was favoured by Le Corbusier in terms of centralised planning based on class stratification, something which assumed antagonistic communities from the start. In Chandigarh, where he had an opportunity to put his ideas into practice, \u2018there is a total failure to produce built forms that could aid social organization or social integration; the sections fail to function as neighbourhoods. The city is 1 Hall, Cities of Tomorrow, p. 3. 2 Ibid., p. 87. 37 Ibid., p. 123. 2 3 8 P. Goodman and P. Goodman, Communitas: Means of Livelihood and IVfs ofLfe Ww York: Random 3 House, i960), p. 55. heavily segregated by income and civil service rank, different densities for different social groups, resulting in planned class segregation.\u20191 At the opposite end of the scale was Jane Jacobs\u2019 prescription for the regeneration of cities, The Death and Life of the Great American Cities. What the planners have given us, she argued, are low income projects that become worse centres of delinquency, vandalism and general social hopelessness than the slums they were supposed to replace; middle income housing projects which are truly marvels of dullness and regimentation, sealed against any buoyancy or vitality of city life; luxury housing projects that mitigate their inanity... with a vapid vulgarity; cultural centres that are unable to support a good bookstore; civic centres that are avoided by everyone but bums, who have fewer choices of loitering than others; commercial centres that are lacklustre imitations of standardized suburban chain store shopping; promenades that go from no place to nowhere and have no promenaders; expressways that eviscerate great cities. This is not the rebuilding of cities, this is the sacking of cities.2 She wanted instead to keep the inner city neighbourhood more or less as it was before the planners had got their hands on it. As she noted, planning and zoning make it impossible for children to play in a world composed of both men and women. Her remedy to achieve \u2018exuberant diversity\u2019 was mixed functions and land uses, conventional streets on short blocks and a dense concentration of people.3' A well used city street, she argued famously, is apt to be a safe street where a deserted street is unsafe. Along with many city dwellers she agreed that one of the advantages of the city over the small community were the possibilities for privacy. A good city street neighbourhood achieves a marvel of balance between its people\u2019s determination to have essential privacy and their simultaneous wishes for differing degrees of contact, enjoyment, or help from people around.\u20194 Following her lead, Richard Sennett argued that the square surrounded by townhouses makes human density count socially. Such density permits the expression of personal deviation or idiosyncracy in a milieu where there are too many people thrown together to discipline everyone to the same norm.43 Alice Coleman, as we have seen, had many concrete proposals for making neighbourhoods safer and more conducive to genuine community living. Amongst other things this involved largely eliminating the \u2018shared public space\u2019 which 1 Hall, Cities of Tomorrow, p. 214. 2 J. Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1994; orig. 1961), p. 14. 3 Hall, Cities of Tomorrow, p. 235. 4 Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 70. 4 43 R. Sennett, The Uses of Disorder (New York: Norton, 1990), p. 159. was so fashionable in the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century, and reinstating private gardens, and fences or hedges to lean over and talk to your neighbours.1 Jacobs was not a proponent of what Reinhold Niebuhr called \u2018salvation by bricks\u2019. Like many of the planners she opposed, she too believed that failures with city neighbourhoods are ultimately failures in localised self government \u2018used in its broadest sense meaning both informal and formal self management of society\u2019.2 The planning problem was, then, only a planning problem to the extent that it was also a political problem. What is clear is that whilst badly designed built environments can generate crime and vandalism, it is not possible to build people into virtue. Nevertheless, Jacobs\u2019 prescriptions quickly became orthodoxy and good neighbourhood design is said to need an identifiable neighbourhood centre and an identifiable edge; a limited breadth to a neighbourhood based on the distance a person can comfortably walk approximately a quarter of a mile; a mixture of uses and a mixture of different kinds of housing in close proximity to one another; a network of interconnected streets; and appropriate locations for civic buildings schools, churches, post offices, meeting halls and day care centres. 3 These proposals all seem based on the facilitating of face to face meeting, but this has been strongly challenged as an ideal for community by Iris Marion Young, who argues that the old Gemeinschaft type of community was oppressive and excluded difference. Privileging face to face relations, in her view, has the inevitable consequence that those not in the family, clique, or group are excluded.4 Cities, on the other hand, instantiate social relations of difference without exclusion. City life is the being together of strangers characterised by the celebration of difference, an ambience in which deviant and minority groups can flourish under the cover of anonymity, diverse activities, \u2018eroticism\u2019 \u2014 the enjoyment of the other\u2019s difference \u2014 and the provision of public space where \u2018people stand and sit together, interact and mingle, or simply witness one another, without becoming unified in a community of shared final ends\u2019.48 Young draws on Richard Sennett\u2019s influential The Uses of Disorder, which argued that the demand for \u2018community\u2019, purified of all that might convey a feeling of difference, is built on an adolescent fear of the pain of 1 A. Coleman, Utopiaon Trial: Vision and Reality in Planned Housing (London: Shipman, 1985), pp. iyoff. 2 Jacobs, Death and Life, p. 220. 3 P. Langdon,^ Better Place to Live (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994), p. 217. 4 I. M. Young, Justice and the Politics of Difference (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 227. challenge and participation.1 The family in particular, he argues, acts as a shield from diversity. To grow to adulthood we need to be able to tolerate painful ambiguity and uncertainty, and we therefore need the anarchy the city can provide. \u2018The great promise of city life is a new kind of confusion possible within its borders, an anarchy that will not destroy men, but make them richer and more mature.\u20192 In the healthy city there will be no escape from situations of confrontation and conflict, and this depends on diverse and ineradicably different kinds of people being thrown together and forced to deal with each other for mutual survival.3 Dense disorderly cities would challenge the capacity of family groups to act as intensive shelters, as shields from diversity, and would create a feeling of need in the individual that he or she had to get involved in situations outside the little routines of their daily life in order to survive with the people around them.52 Perhaps the best comment on these arguments is the situation David Harvey discusses, two decades after Sennett was writing, when New York City had to decide which contesting group should control the public space of Tompkins Square Park. The demands of the homeless who slept in the park, the parents who took their children to play in it, the drug pushers who used it for their trade, the skateboarders, the basketball players, the radicals, the punks, the heavy metal bands, chess players and dog walkers were mutually incompatible. In this situation \u2018openness to unassimilated otherness\u2019 breaks apart into open war. New York City\u2019s desperate solution was to close the park altogether \u2018for rehabilitation\u2019. Harvey wittily frames the dilemma: What should the policy maker and planner do in the face of these conditions? Give up planning andjoin one of those burgeoning cultural studies programmes which revel in chaotic scenes of the Tompkins sort while simultaneously disengaging from any commitment to do something about them? Deploy all the critical powers of deconstruction and semiotics to seek new and engaging interpretations of graffiti which say, \u2018Die, Yuppie scum\u2019? Should we join revolutionary and anarchist groups and fight for the rights of the poor and culturally marginalised to express their rights and if necessary make a home for themselves in the park? Or should we...join with the forces of law and order and help impose some authoritarian solution on the problem?53 It seems it is not as easy to abandon \u2018shared final ends\u2019 as perhaps Young thinks. Moreover, the face to face has an uncomfortable habit 1 Sennett, Uses of Disorder, p. 42. 2 Ibid., p. 108. 3 Ibid., p. 163. 52 Ibid., p. 169. 2 53 \u2018Social Justice, Postmodernism and the City5, in The Improvement of the Built Environment and Social 3 Integration in Cities (Luxembourg: Official Publications of the EC, 1992), p. 26. of reasserting itself, as in Young\u2019s description of the city as composed of \u2018clusters of people with affinities families, social groups, networks, voluntary associations, neighbourhood networks, a vast array of small \u201ccommunities\u2019\u201d.1 These clusters of face to face relations are, on her view, perhaps the source of the difficulties in Tompkins Park. And in the last decade of the twentieth century cities often developed in quite the opposite direction to \u2018undifferentiated otherness\u2019. In London\u2019s Docklands, for example, a cynical piece of political engineering in the interests of corporate finance eliminated street related activities except for the very rich. This was the opposite of the \u2018mixed use\u2019 formula. The same prioritisation of wealth has led to what Mike Davis called, in relation to Los Angeles, \u2018the carceral city\u2019. This is the city of omnipresent security cameras, police and private security guards, \u2018fortress cities\u2019 brutally divided between \u2018fortified cells\u2019 of affluent society and \u2018places of terror\u2019 where the police battle the criminalised poor so that the \u2018Second Civil War\u2019 has been institutionalised into the very structure of urban space.2 In this world \u2018community\u2019 means homogeneity of race, class and home values. The most powerful \u2018social movement\u2019 in contemporary Southern California, Davis remarks ironically, is that of affluent homeowners engaged in defending home values and neighbourhood exclusiveness.3\u00ae The fastest growing type of \u2018community\u2019 in the United States is the gated community. Twenty eight million Americans now live in such areas. Over 30 per cent of residential development in southern California is now in this form, one example having a wall, moat and drawbridge and a device which shoots a metal cylinder through the bottom of unauthorised cars.4 We live, says Davis, in a post liberal society, with the gangplanks pulled up and compassion strictly rationed by the Federal deficit.5 What Garreau writes about Edge City confirms this. The centre of these places are the shopping malls, proud of their crime free record. But they are crime free because they are policed like prisons, and any problem characters are promptly banned. \u2018It\u2019s a question\u2019, says Garreau, \u2018of how much we value safety and comfort. In Edge City there is very little truly \u201cpublic\u201d space. On purpose.\u20196 The elimination of public space is obviously hostile to community, and the great malls 1 Young, Justice^ p. 237. 2 3 57 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greenings p. 146. Harvey notes that between 1987 and 1997 the 4 numbers of Americans living in gated communities rose from one to six million. Spaces ofHope&gt; p. 150. 5 Davis, City of Quartz, p. 316. 6 J. Garreau, Edge City (New York: Anchor Doubleday, 1991), p. 52. are destructive of community in other ways. First, as is well known, their development has devastated many city centres, which become secondary centres \u2018attracting local customers buying low quality or discount goods\u2019. This starts a downward spiral of degradation which affects every aspect of city life.60 Secondly, malls are not, like the older style shopping centres, places where people meet and discuss the issues of the day. \u2018The focus is on consumption, on the pleasure of just being there. The issues that are part of our everyday community are not discussed there, so it doesn\u2019t function as a community.\u201961 A related problem in the contemporary city is the complaint that international capital homogenises the city and abolishes difference. This complaint presupposes that local identity is essential to community. It is undeniable that any Western city is now full of the same shops, advertisements and shopping malls. Nevertheless, according to Antony Cohen, people domesticate the city, mark out their own territories, cache resources at strategic points, and invest the city with culture. \u2018People en culture the city, rather than responding passively to its deterministic power.\u201962 This is a version of the claim I have argued for that people ensoul places. As with all \u2018common culture\u2019 arguments, however, the question is whether the politics we see at both local and national level do not belie the claims. We need to give people credit for the ingenuity with which they create social relationships through which they can adapt the spatial and physical environment of the city to their own capacities and resources, says Cohen. But of course this ingenuity can be utilised to marginalise otherness. It is not necessarily used for \u2018the common good\u2019, a phrase which might be disallowed by postmodern critics, but by which I mean that enabling of all citizens which Young and others aim at. THE SUBURBAN COMMUNITY Throughout the twentieth century suburbia attracted sharply different views on its merits as a place for community. Though critics like Mumford loathed it the public voted with their feet, and, in the North, suburbia remained the most popular place to live, though this may have been faute de mieux. As a locus for community the jury is still out. Suburbia is nuclear familyland. The arguments in favour of suburbia focus first of all on the benefits for the family, and especially for bringing \u00ae\u00b0 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greening, p. 98. 61 Langdon, Better Place, p. 21. 62 A. Cohen and K. Fukui (eds.), Humanising the City? Social Contexts of Urban Life at the Turn of the Millennium (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1993), p. 5. up children. Questioning people in Levittown Gans found that people spoke first of wanting to get out of the city, and next of bringing up children. Mainly they came for a house, and not a social environment.1 From the start a strong domestic ideology was expressed in the suburban ideal which quickly established itself as perennial, when it was actually quite new. Until the end of the eighteenth century, as in parts of the Third World today, the gender division of labour was not so marked. Men reaped and women stooked the corn; men wove and women span; men milked and women made butter and cream. In the early industrial revolution men and women worked equally in the factories and mines. It was the growth of the salaried middle class which introduced a new division of labour. The man went out to work and the wife stayed at home. \u2018The creation of an environment in which this division of middle class male lives between a public world of work contacts and a private world of family life was what the rise of suburbia was all about,\u2019 writes F. M. L. Thompson: The clear separation of work and home, the insistence on social distancing, the treatment of the home as the feminine domain, the importance attached to domestic privacy and the exclusion of the vulgar prying multitude can all be seen as parts of a code of individual responsibility, male economic dominance and female domestic subordination, and family nurtured morality which served to give the bourgeois a social identity and mark them off from the upper class and the lower orders. The separation of work from domestic life was occurring in the late 18th century as a result of changes in production technology and business organization which made the home an unsuitable or impossible place formany kinds oftrade and manufacture; the emphasis on personal religious and moral responsibility and behaviour from the Glapham sect, whose message was powerfully reinforced by the French revolution and fears of disorderly irreligious mobs gave a central role to the family as the main instrument of moral education; and the socially segregated suburb of separate family houses shordy emerged to supply the ideal environment for practising the newly reformed life style incorporating these religious, moral and social aspirations.2 These changes gradually spread by cultural seepage, and were generalised in the great suburban estates of the mid twentieth century, which had real advantages. Unlike older industrial housing a garden was available for the children. In the new suburbs, said Mumford, \u2018the problem of creating an urban environment favourable to the health and nurture of children was solved by the middle classes as it had never been solved 1 H. Gans, The Levittowners (London: Allen Lane, 1967), pp. 36\u20147. 2 F. M. L. Thompson, The rise of Suburbia (Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1982), p. 9. before, except in the almost equally open country town or village. The mere opening up of space was an essential part of the solution.\u20191 Population density was less than in the city and so there was a greater sense of repose. In the British suburbs at least, before the rise of out of town shopping, shops, schools and post offices were all within easy reach. From the start suburbs tended to attract people of the same social class and Mumford observed that in providing a small face to face community of identifiable people, participating in the common life as equals, it superficially restored the dream ofjeffersonian democracy.2 Gans argued that whatever the criticism, suburban living, as exemplified by the post Second World War development of Levittown, represented a huge improvement over previous ages: By any yardstick one chooses, Levittowners treat their fellow residents more ethically and more democratically than did their parents and grandparents. They aiso live a \u2018fuller\u2019 and \u2018richer\u2019 life. Their culture may be less subtle and sophisticated than that of the intellectual, their family life less healthy than that advocated by psychiatrists, and their politics less thoughtful and democratic than the political philosophers\u2019 yet all of these are superior to what prevailed among the working and lower middle classes of past generations.3 James Richards, who saw an anarchist streak in suburbia, felt that the suburban environment provided an opportunity of individual self expression for people to whom it was otherwise denied. The argument is that creative activity can only be encouraged among the mass of people by building on a foundation of their own existing modes of expression. For this purpose sophisticated standards of taste and criticism can conveniently be forgotten.68 For these positives there are, however, vehement negatives. Already in 1913 A. T. Edwards argued that low density housing contravenes humankind\u2019s desire for fellowship. Working men, he said, just want a better house and a better street, not a suburb. \u2018The very word suburban implies something that is second rate, some narrow and pharisaical attitude of mind... but of all suburbs the most shoddy and depressing is the typical garden suburb. It has neither the crowded interest of the town, nor the quiet charm of the country, it gives us the advantages neither of solitude nor of society.\u201969 Philip Langdon argues that it is no coincidence that at the moment when the United States has become a 1 Mumford, City, p. 558. 2 Ibid., p. 569. 3 Gans, Levittowners, p. 419. 2 68 J. M. Richards, Castles on the Ground: The Anatomy of Suburbia (London: John Murray, 1973), p. 89. 3 89 A. Edwards, The Design of Suburbia Condon\\ Pembridge, 1981), p.223. predominantly suburban nation, the country has suffered a bitter harvest of individual trauma, family distress, and civic decay.1 In his Bomb the Suburbs manifesto William Wimsatt described them as \u2018an unfortunate geographical location, an unfortunate state of mind. It\u2019s the American state of mind, founded on fear, conformity, shallowness of morals and dullness of character.\u20192 The suburbs are lauded as a good place for the family, but the downside of this is neglect of wider aspects of community. Suburbs lack the informal gathering places to be found both in villages and cities pubs, cafes, coffee shops and they therefore lack the space for the real formation of community through the invisible filigree of debate and argument. Ironically they have also been attacked for failing to provide enough privacy. \u2018The group mindedness embodied in the cul de sac seems to be based on a simple \u201cjust folks\u201d conviction that no matter who moves into the cul de sac, the little society of neighbours will get along famously. This is a foolishly optimistic assumption.\u2019 The option for escape is at least as important as the option for contact, and there are many examples of informal suburban policing of taste quite as strong as anything to be found in a village.3 Some deny that the suburbs are a good place to bring up children. \u2018The traditional street system draws youngsters out, pretty much at their own pace. The world beckons as an interesting place... there is no corresponding term for intelligence in modern suburbs... youngsters in the cul de sac have a hard time getting to know their community or the communities that lie beyond.\u20194 This is partly because suburbia is dependent on the car and the television, both things which isolate people. \u2018The low density, dispersed city, made possible by the automobile, is a physically and socially fragmented city. Its day to day function causes stress and people retreat to their homes for relaxation and relief.\u201974 Mumford pointed out that as soon as the car became common walking distances were destroyed as a normal means ofhuman circulation. Extension of the suburb has made it impossible. \u2018As a result, Unwin\u2019s salutary demonstration, Nothing Gained by Overcrowding, must now be countered with a qualifying admonition: Something Lost by Overspacing.\u201975 Overall, Mumford felt that suburbia was based on a flight from reality. 75 Mumford, City, pp. 575\u20146. 1 Langdon, Better Place&gt; p. i. 2 Quoted by Homi Bhabha in R. Silverstone (ed.), Visions of Suburbia (London: Routledge, 1997), p.298. 3 Langdon, Better Place&gt; p. 43. 4 Ibid., p. 49. 4 74 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greenings p. 166. In the suburbs one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world... Here domesticity could flourish, forgetful of the exploitation on which so much of it is based. Here individuality could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child centred environment: it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.1 The suburbs lost the dialectical tensions and struggles which made city life significant.2 Many authors agree that suburbs bred a flight from civic or political engagement. \u2018The suburban dream equalled selfishness, a rejection of obligation and commitment to the city where the suburbanite earned his living. A suburban house bred detachment from civic responsibility. It imperilled community spirit by highlighting class distinctions residentially.\u20193 Herbert Cans\u2019 field work challenged many of these assumptions. Viewed sociologically suburbs are not simply an aggregation of nuclear families, but a dense network of community groups and organisations which embrace a very high percentage of their occupants. Gans found more than a hundred associations flourishing after only three years. This is perhaps the kind of tribal community of which Bauman speaks, grouped around interests Gans conceded he found little interest in national affairs there. But even in the village and the city something of the same applies. Gans challenged the existence of the community the critics missed in suburbia. Nostalgic social critics want to \u2018revive\u2019 a sense of community \u2018that never was save in their imagination, instead of planning for the effective functioning of and improved living conditions in those aggregates to which we give the name \u201ccommunity\u201d\u2019.4 Two questions in particular pertain to the suburb. First, the ideology which originally led to their formation has broken down, as reflected in the rise to parity of the female workforce. This is a return to the norm of all human societies under the condition of wage labour. Are the suburbs equally suited to this new situation, and in particular the rise in so called one parent families? Secondly, if the kind of social disintegration which Langdon finds in the suburbs is in fact what they produce then they urgently need surgery. He proposes the introduction of pubs, caf\u00e9s, neighbourhood stores. Gans, on the other hand, finds suburban community in good order, within a roughly lower middle class frame of 1 Ibid., p.563. 77 Ibid. 2 78 P. J. Willin', /on!/. City and Nation: England idgo /\u25a0,// (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 3 P U 5 4 Gans, Levittowners, p. 146. reference. Suburbanites, he says, \u2018enjoy the house and outdoor living and take pleasure from the large supply of compatible people, without experiencing the boredom or malaise ascribed to suburban homogeneity\u2019.1 His findings were an accelerated social life, not a diminished one. Colin Ward would agree. Looking at Runcorn New Town, and the network of community associations which Gans found in the United States, he believes that \u2018there is an automatic community potential, always waiting to trigger its release\u2019.2 CHURCH, COMMUNITY AND KINGDOM \u2018Trinity\u2019, as Robert Jenson has taught us, is the Christian name for God.3 The doctrine is the articulation of three sets of historical experience, but when reflected points us to a God who is not the Unmoved Mover, the Alone with the Alone, but the one who is community in Godself. Nothing was more remarkable in the history of twentieth century theology than the recovery and development of this insight. Though the doctrine is historically given, and not a deduction about the nature of love, it is, of course, also a commentary on the claim that God is love. The recovery of the doctrine has important implications for our understanding of community and the built environment. It seems to privilege face to face community in a way Young and others would find alienating. How should we respond to these claims? It is true that if we want an illustration of the way in which a community ideology can breed exclusion we need only look at the Christian medieval city, and the growth of the ghetto. On the other hand, if we wanted a phrase to describe the attitude of the figures in the Rublyev icon, \u2018openness to unassimilated otherness\u2019 would do very well. The Trinitarian doctrine of relations has wrestled with this problem, understanding the divine persons as defined by their relations, whilst remaining distinct. Thus the Father is the Father because the Son is the Son, and so on. Who Father, Son and Spirit are is predicated both on real difference (we cannot say \u2018ontological difference\u2019 of course) and on real unity. The doctrine of perichoresis, mutual indwelling, sought to theorise this. If human beings are made in the divine image then it is this form of relationship to which we have to aspire. As is by now very well documented, the doctrine of the Trinity was a dead letter for a millennium and a half 1 Ibid., p. 409. 2 G. Ward, New Town, Home Town (London: Gulbenkian, 1993), p. 62. 3 R. Jenson, The Triune Identity (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1982). in effectively monarchical societies where power was focused in one ruler. Trinitarian reflection, on the other hand, invites open and mutually defined forms of power. But how to realise that? Young develops her views through a critique of Murray Bookchin, and his \u2018wildly utopian\u2019 communitarian views, which would require the complete re shaping of the North American city. But as David Harvey observes, her own proposals, like Sandercock\u2019s, are quite as wildly utopian and \u2018naively specified in relation to the actual dynamics of urbanization\u2019.83 We are committed to assimilation in some shape or form by the very process of living together. This may happen by learning from the other, or by the process by which we internalise our enemies\u2019 traits. But the deepest threat to the maintenance of otherness is, as already mentioned, what Gregory Baum calls the power of secondary culture, the global power of the universal image makers which represents, as Marx said of the bourgeoisie, a truly revolutionary force.84 The limits of this power, which knows no walls or ghettoes, have yet to be discovered. If we can approach the question of community through the doctrine of God, equally can we through Christology. Human beings are understood in analogy with Jesus of Nazareth, the \u2018man for others\u2019. This means, as Barth put it, that fellow humanity is fundamental to our being. \u2018Every supposed humanity which is not radically and from the very first fellow humanity is inhumanity.\u201985 I am who I am in encounter. I am created to give and receive help to and from my neighbour, and thus to be human is to be committed to community. From this point of view theologians are bound to be sceptical of the possibilities of the company of strangers. When do we move from being strangers, erotically eyeing up one another, to being neighbours who help one another? A number of well publicised assaults in United States cities where large numbers of people have looked on but not intervened highlight the negative side of Young\u2019s heterogeneous, plural and playful public. Another sceptical question to the critics of community is whether it is not the cultural logic of late capitalism which lurks behind much, if not all, postmodern theory and its respect for difference. Nietzsche is the avowed prophet of postmodernity, but he is also the prophet of the lonely individual, the man of \u2018azure isolation\u2019, at home only with the eagles and the strong winds. This view of humanity is congenial to competitive 83 D. Harvey Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 312. i:+ G. Baum, \u2018Two Question Marks: Inculturation and Multiculturalism, Concilium 1994/2, pp. 101 6. 85 K. llarthX'XeX Dogmatics 111 /2 (Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark, i960), p. 228. capitalism, which has no time for community save in so far as it keeps people docile. Does \u2018openness to unassimilated otherness\u2019 amount to much more than the individualism of liberal late capitalist society? \u2014 a question Young faces but does not, to my mind, answer satisfactorily. When we speak of\u2018community\u2019 theologically, we speak of the Church. Christ calls into a being a fellowship, a \u2018body\u2019. True, this is understood as a pilgrim people, leading a marginal existence, but it also has a sacramental significance for humanity as whole. If this were not the case the Church could not be the witness to human salvation and the place where this is sacramentally realised. We can understand this sacramental significance, vis a vis the built environment, in six dimensions, as pointing to what Kjellberg calls an \u2018emancipatory koinonia\u2019.1 To begin with the Church is always first and foremost a heal community, globally networked. What are or were called in Latin America \u2018base communities\u2019 are the building blocks of the Church. True community begins in the face to face, but looks outward to the entire oikumene, the whole inhabited earth. In this respect Church is sacramental for human community at large. No church, not even a cathedral, can be too large, indeed churches have always manifested the self limiting principles of ancient Greek cities, hiving off to form new settlements when they grow too large. Mumford\u2019s objections to the \u2018shapeless giantism\u2019 of the great city have a real point. It is essential to begin small, to act local and think global. This is indicated by the fact that industry already seems to be discovering the limits of telecommuting in that it cuts out \u2018synergy\u2019, the creative interaction which happens in face to face meeting. \u2018There is no substitute\u2019, the Goodmans remarked, \u2018for the spontaneous social conflux whose atoms unite, precisely, as citizens of a city.\u20192 At the same time it is at the local level that the alienating structures of the city, bound up with bureaucracy, are dealt with. Writing of the African city Aylward Shorter speaks of the base ecclesial communities as crossing inner frontiers and tending toward anti structure resisting institutionalisation in the interests of freedom and equality.3 The base community or parish principle, what Kirkpatrick Sale calls \u2018human scale\u2019, has long been recognised to have implications for town planning. Thus the American town planner Clarence Perry was already recommending \u2018neighbourhood units\u2019 of 3,000 to 9,000 people in the 1930s. The theory was that a neighbourhood should be small enough 1 S. Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheology (Utrecht: International Books, 2000), p. 84. 2 Goodman and Goodman, Communitas, p. 51. 3 A. Shorter, The Church in the African City (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1991) pp. 106, 108. for everything to be within walking distance, but large enough to support an elementary school, local stores and services. A contemporary variation of this suggests streets laid out on rectangular grids to provide maximum connectivity, and the slowing down of traffic to enable people of diverse backgrounds to meet frequently, informally and for different purposes.1 The theory is excellent, but we have yet to learn how to realise it on the ground. Both the post Second World War British New Towns, and Milton Keynes, were built on these principles, and none of them are remarkable for a sense of community. If we ask why, we can of course point to developments which keep people at home increasing comfort, home \u2018entertainment\u2019, increased mobility, long working hours but I suspect it is more in terms of the lack of common purpose, a theme to which I shall return. Planted communities like these differ from \u2018organic\u2019 communities which sprang up to meet particular needs, whether of trade, railway building, mining, fishing, or farming. These needs gave people common tasks and purposes which generated intense pride and commitment.2 The problem of the New Towns is the problem of the suburb \u2014 leisure, refuge, escape is the purpose, and this is inadequate to generate community. Postmodern accounts of cities of difference emphasise the fact that individuals no longer have one single location, but may have several, and that rather than the city being a mosaic of spatially discrete worlds, there are multiple grids within which identity is formed.3 People live in one place, work in another, and take their leisure in another. This is true, but the micro politics of education, health, transport, and even street design, remains obstinately local.4 We have, increasingly, to fight for service provision on a local basis. In this respect the importance of the local remains, especially for children, the elderly and their carers, as also for the disabled. 1 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greening, p. 173. 2 The Radio Ballads, put together by Ewan MacGoll and Robert Parker, made for the BBC between 1959 and 1970, documenting the lives of people in railways, mining, fishing, road building and other industries, instantiated this. 3 G. Pratt, \u2018Grids of Difference\u2019, in R. Fincher andj. M. Jacobs (eds.), Cities of Difference (New York: Guilford, 1998), p. 27. 4 Graham Ward argues, in Cities of God (London: Routledge, 2000), that the world of Cyberspace renders earlier incarnational and liberation theologies inadequate as a response. He develops a subtle mapping of physical and corporate bodies, all caught up in the body of Christ. He rejects MacIntyre\u2019s communitarianism, but puts in its place a \u2018revised\u2019 communitarianism more open to difference. It is difficult to see, however, what this difference would look like in the actual dynamics of community as lived out day by day. Secondly, Church lives by memory and tradition. William Blake, in that great poem of theological geography, Jerusalem, calls the cathedral cities of England the \u2018Friends of Albion\u2019: \u2018Gloucester and Exeter and Salisbury and Bristol, and benevolent Bath\u2019 (Jerusalem 40:61). What he has in mind by this, I believe, is something like what the Catholic theologian Johannes Metz called a \u2018dangerous memory\u2019. Like Israel, the Church exists by relating the past to the present. In the eucharist, for example, contemporary Christians find their orientation for living by recalling deeply obscure events which happened in a small, if troublesome, middle eastern city two thousand years ago. In doing this, I would say, they provide a paradigm for society as a whole. Memory loss is a pathology. For Blake the cathedral cities were friends of Albion because they had at their heart a building, an institution, whose function it was to recall the truth of those events 2000 years ago in Palestine and their significance: the priority of peace and justice. But do they? In his day he believed that the friends of Albion were threatened by their dedication to \u2018druid worship\u2019, the addiction to human sacrifice implicit in the Napoleonic wars and in a criminal justice system which constantly sent the poor to the gallows. Today \u2018druid worship\u2019 is still national defence, but still more consumerism. Church exists sacramentally within society to protest against druid worship, but also to instantiate the central significance of memory and tradition in a world where mobility is prized and indeed expected.1 One of the problems of New Towns is that they have no corporate memory. When a new town was built around the small agricultural community of Stevenage, the community soon divided, the one with one set of memories, the other with memories from elsewhere which could not be simply superimposed on the new place. Memory and tradition depend on rootedness. As Simone Weil argued, early on in the Second World War, human beings do not survive without roots. As we have seen, the average American stays in a place for five years. Repeated millions of times, the decision to move out robs communities of their memories and their social relationships. It leaves them shallow rooted, ill equipped to provide their residents with sustenance during hard times. Sociologists have discovered that longtime residents make a disproportionately large contribution to a community; they do much to define its character and create a sense of continuity. \u2018Any human relationship takes time for seasoning, for testing, for the kind of slow, casual knitting that will not break apart under the first signs 1 As in the notorious advice of Norman Fowler to the unemployed under the Thatcher administration: \u2018On yer bike!\u2019 of strain\u2019, John Killinger writes. Rapid mobility... \u2018does not afford the kind of time years and years of time that are necessary to become rooted in a place, to really know the neighbours, to truly belong to the community, to celebrate the great milestones of life that can be celebrated in a home church or synagogue, to feel, deeply and responsibly, that there is a bond between ourselves and the land, ourselves and the house, ourselves and the neighbourhood, that nourishes and replenishes our beings\u2019.1 Thirdly, Church is the community where sin is recognised and forgiveness asked for. It is not an ideal community: Augustine\u2019s struggle with Pelagius in the fifth century was precisely over the destructiveness of idealising ways of thought. It is the community offorgiven sinners, but a community on the way to an eschatological goal. Part of the problem with the notion of community has been its idealisation, the power of the image projected by Mary Mitford, effectively without conflict. This is the downside of the romanticism I praised earlier on. In relation to development work Smit argues that \u2018the notion of a community is always something of a myth. A community implies a consensus. The reality is that communities, more often than not, are made up of an agglomeration of factions and interest groups often locked in competitive relationships\u20192 But does community imply consensus? It did not in the earliest church communities we know, in Corinth, Galatia or Rome far from it. A community which lives by sin and forgiveness is not a community of consensus, but a community which has found a way of coping with conflict and difference. As Laurie Green puts it, God does not despise difference, but creates it.3 This is similar to the community Young and Sennett want, but unlike Young it seems to me that the network of face to face groups she mentions are the only place such negotiation can happen. The question of consensus is raised in the sharpest form by the politics of identity. As Andrew Hake has argued, the task of the Church in plural societies is to both support and radically criticise the framework which holds a plural society together, but also to be an active protagonist for minority group positions. The theological ground for this is the Noachic covenant which embraces all humankind.4 Without this community degenerates into communalism, in which community is pitted against community. 1 Langdon, Better Pla.ce&gt; p. 76. 2 Quoted in J. Abbott, Sharing the City (London, Earthscan, 1996), pp. 119\u201420. 3 L. Green, The Impact of the Global (London: Church House, 2000), p. 45. 4 A. Hake, \u2018Theological Reflections on \u201cCommunity\u201d\u2019, in A. Harvey (ed.), Theology in the City (London: SPCK, 1989) p. 53. Fourthly, justice is essential to community, as the prophets of Israel always maintained. Justice, in their understanding, was what ensured that all Israelites had their rightful share in the land which was gifted to all, and that it was not cornered for the few. Christologically it refers to what is demanded for human beings by the fact that all are sisters and brothers of the Human One. Conditions which degrade some at the expense of others contravene that demand. Pragmatically speaking it is also true that a society which contains within it sharp inequalities in life chances and outcomes will be unstable since the have nots will wish to progress and the haves will protect their advantages.1 As Moltmann puts it, the protected life of gated communities is pleasant but inhuman whilst the unprotected life of the slums is unpleasant but has more potential for human closeness and community. \u2018The surrender of the privileges of the rich\u2019, he comments, \u2018is not too high a price to pay for a humane society, with dignity and justice on both sides.\u20192 But does not the prioritisation of difference preclude any agreement on justice the situation Harvey illustrates in relation to Tompkins Park? By way of response Harvey turns to an argument of Engels, to the effect that though it was impossible to achieve philosophical agreement on the notion of the term there was nevertheless a widely accepted meaning which gave it \u2018political and mobilising power\u2019. Acceptance of this understanding of justice would, he argued, cut through the potentially immobilising insistence on postmodern difference.3 I believe we are less stymied by disputes about the nature of justice than Harvey allows. At the back of any notion of justice is the idea of human equality: there cannot be \u2018justice\u2019 between the freemen and slaves of Aristotle\u2019s Athens, for example. \u2018Justice\u2019 requires equal treatment of equals. The medieval theologians, writing in a profoundly hierarchical society, got round this by distinguishing between distributive and commutative justice, roughly, what is due to every person in virtue of their human needs, and what is due to them in virtue of their social status. Since the eighteenth century this distinction has been re written in terms of what we have \u2018earned\u2019, what we contribute to society in terms of skill and expertise, and what we deserve by way of the responsibility we exercise. This distinction effectively serves to negate equality, and make it a purely notional matter. At the same time the discourse of rights has put equality at the forefront, constantly underlining the fact that it is deeply paradoxical to expect one person to live in a slum 1 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greening, p. 145. 2 J. Moltmann, Experiences in Theology (London: SCM, 2000), p. 186. 3 Harvey, Justice, p. 35. or a bleak estate, and another in a gated suburb or mansion. Disputes about justice are often camouflage to obfuscate this paradox. Of course, it is quite unrealistic to expect equal treatment between equals to be honoured in the face of the legacy of ten millennia of inequality, written into the landscape. Since we can only have true community amongst equals this means that community is always going to be an unfinished project in any class divided society. For in relation to the built environment it is not justice but power which shapes the city and, as Harvey observes, finance capital can produce cityscapes from which the mass of the population are alienated in an unrecuperable way.1 Nevertheless, as a goal to aim for, we need to extend to the built environment and to planning those structures and institutions, treating all alike and embodying serious concern for social justice, which Hake calls for as essential to any community\u2019s proper functioning.2 Related to this, and embracing the whole, is, fifthly, common purpose, the \u2018shared final ends\u2019 Young believes must be dropped from our credo. The Church exists in virtue of a common story and a common hope, but in doing so is it anything more than one shared interest group among many? Should this apply to the city, and if it does, does it oppressively eliminate difference? Kevin Lynch hoped that the city landscape could express the common hopes and pleasures of ordinary people, so that \u2018the sense of community may be made flesh\u2019. \u2018Above all, if the environment is visibly organized and sharply identified, then the citizens can inform it with their own meanings and connections, then it will become a place, remarkable and unmistakeable.\u20193 In practice the articulation of genuinely common hopes and pleasures is essential for the survival of the public places Young celebrates in the city, as the Tompkins Park story illustrates. Can we expect such an articulation in the postmodern city? Adrian Hastings talks of\u2018a rare moment of communitas \u2019 in Britain during the Second World War, precisely the time when class divisions were momentarily overcome by the need to resist a common enemy.4 The community spirit in the former slums was probably generated by the need to help people tackle adverse conditions. Overcoming a common threat is also the key to the success of the village of Husa in Sweden, instanced by the authors of Greening the Built Environment. Faced with the collapse of a traditional industry, and a sharply dwindling population, the community took action 1 Harvey, Justice^ p. 278. Canary Wharf is, of course, a case in point. 2 Hake, \u2018Theological Reflections5, p. 56. 3 K. Lynch, The Image of the City (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT i960), pp. 91 2. 4 A. Hastings, A History of English Christianity ig2o ig8g (London: Collins, 1986), p. 361. by setting up fifteen cooperative enterprises. The key features of success are community action, participation, inclusiveness and the use of local resources and enterprises.1 Victor Papanek gives the example of a park in which children never played being turned round, and made the centre of all sorts of community activities, by the simple device of erecting a glass shelter with four used washing machines and a dryer in the centre of it. Parents could then watch over their children and get on with chores at the same time.2 Colin Ward documents the growth of a genuine spirit of community amongst people building their own houses. A member of the self build group in Lewisham said: The one thing that\u2019s left me intensely proud is the co operative spirit on the Brockley site. A wife had a baby the other week. The buntings were out and the balloons... If someone requires a babysitter... if someone\u2019s working on a car... or the communal garden... they get help. They pay a pound a week to a communal fund. They\u2019ve landscaped the gardens last year. No one tells them to do that. They do it themselves because they have control over where they are living and they contribute.3 In the postmodern context, with its \u2018collapse of meta narratives\u2019, is there any chance that huge populations will share a common project except in time of emergency? Were they to do so, what would it be? One answer, which still has great power, is civic pride, as instanced in the re creation of Birmingham, England, over the past decade. People continue to be proud of their villages, towns and cities, and are increasingly prepared to fight when their integrity is threatened by purely commercial interests. Seppo Kjellberg has sought to promote patterns of dialogue between the various interest groups in Finnish cities, and believes that, at a time when the great meta narratives have been \u2018criticized to death\u2019, religion has a role in enabling people to feel integrated.4 More globally, very considerable pressure was mobilised over the issue of Third World debt, and it may be that a similar movement will arise on the issue of the environment. In this respect Hans Kiing\u2019s proposals for a global ethic, based on respect for both people and planet, may be a pointer for the future.5 To the objection that this is too abstract a thing for people to commit themselves to, the answer is that what we are talking about is the sharing and safeguarding of the basic resources of life, and there is 1 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greenings p. 178. 2 V Papanek, The Green Imperative (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 194. 3 C. Ward, When We Build Again (London: Pluto, 1985), p. 83. 4 Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheology, p. 24. 5 H. Kting and H. Schmidt, A Global Ethic and Global Responsibilities (London: SCM, 1998). nothing more concrete than this. This global ethic is, of course, not by any means identical with the gospel of the kingdom far from it. But it has many echoes and analogies in that gospel, and stands in a relation of creative dialogue with it. Finally, the Church is semper rformanda, always in the process of recreation and re discovery. Though the Church lives by tradition and memory it knows no final form, no fixed and forever pattern of ministry, no formulation of doctrine which cannot be revised. In this sense, most importantly, it is sacramental for the human community at large. Though we are committed to the attempt to construct community this will always be fragile, always in need of re invention. As the texts of Isaiah, Ezekiel and Revelation all suggest, the full realisation of community will be eschatological. \u2018Failure\u2019 is something we must expect, and some failures will, perhaps, teach us nothing, but this is not a cause for cultural pessimism, for theses about the decline of the West, or any other culture. Because community is an eschatological reality it is founded on faith and hope, and therefore born afresh in each generation. Looking at the history of community as articulated in the built environment there are certainly milieux which make for it, and others which militate against it. Like the town planners at the beginning of the twentieth century, we have to seek to learn from these without simply mimicking the past. But even the worst environments, like the East End slums, can sometimes be places for supportive and nourishing community. In its story telling and in its brokenness the Church remains a witness to both the possibility and the centrality of community to the human journey. It looks forward to the day Isaiah spoke of when They shall build houses and inhabit them: they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands. (Isa. 65.21 2) But is it art? And in the spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God. It has the glory of God and a radiance like a very rare jewel, like jasper, clear as crystal. (Revelation 21.10 11) The city is a fact in nature, like a cave, a run of mackerel or an ant heap, says Lewis Mumford. \u2018But it is also a conscious work of art, and it holds within its communal framework many simpler and more personal forms of art.\u2019 Mind takesform in the city: and in turn, urban forms condition mind. For space, no less than time, is artfully reorganized in cities: in boundary lines and silhouettes, in the fixing of horizontal planes and vertical peaks, in utilizing or denying the natural site, the city records the attitude of a culture and an epoch to the fundamental facts of its existence. The dome and the spire, the open avenue and the closed court, tell the story, not merely of different physical accommodations, but of essentially different conceptions of man\u2019s destiny. The city is both a physical utility for collective living and a symbol of those collective purposes and unanimities that arise under such favouring circumstances. With language itself it remains man\u2019s greatest work of art.1 Jane Jacobs\u2019 great manifesto, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, was written to confute most of Mumford\u2019s contentions. In cities, she argued, we are dealing with life at its most complex and intense.\u2018Because this is so, there is a basic aesthetic limitation on what can be done with cities: a city cannot be a work of art.\u2019 She granted that art was needed in the arrangement of cities, but insisted on a distinction between art and life. When they were confused within cities, she said, you get not art but taxidermy.2 Nicholas Habraken argues that \u2018no living town is beautiful 1 L. Mumford, The Culture of Cities (London, Seeker &amp; Warburg, 1938), p. 5 (my italics). 2 J. Jacobs, The Death and Life of Great American Cities (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1994), p 3 ^ (my italics). in the way a work of art is\u2019. The beauty of a town is more like the beauty we find in nature of plants, rocks, people. \u2018When we think a town is beautiful we mean something else... that we can identify with it, that in the shape we see we can encounter the inhabitants, that we feel a confrontation with daily life.\u20193 Can the built environment be a work of art? Should it be? And does theology have anything to say on the matter? I shall argue that every city indeed every village and suburb has its aesthetic, a particular quality to its urban space. In this sense I wish to argue that every settlement can be considered a work of art, which does not preclude there being bad art. As we saw in the second chapter, in the story about public parks in Calcutta, the question of aesthetics is not irrelevant to the question of human liberation, to what promotes fullness of life. Aesthetics and ethics therefore come together. Settlements as art, however, obviously have certain peculiarities. Like a piece of sculpture, they are embodied art, but they are also, like a play or a symphony, temporal art, extended over time in the case of Jerusalem, Rome or Athens, well over two millennia.4 In that case they are not the work of one person or even of one community, but the work of many communities, often with different understandings of what it means to be human. At the same time this historical collage embodies corporate memory: the understanding of the human project of past generations continues to speak to us through the buildings that remain and the very layout of the streets. And apart from odd places like Carcassonne or Nablus, which become empty shells, settlements go on changing over time. They are palimpsests. A settlement which stands completely still is dead. To be alive is to write contemporary meanings into our environment. The question is, can we agree what they are? THEOLOGY, ART AND FORM Ernst Fischer defined art, using a term with an Aristotelian pedigree, as \u2018the giving of form.\u20195 The architect Christopher Day uses straightforwardly theological categories in describing art as the imbuing of matter with spirit.6 Fischer and Day\u2019s accounts of art correspond to the two different creation stories at the beginning of Genesis. In the beginning, 3 N. Habraken, Housing Supports: An Alternative to Mass Housing (London: The Architectural Press, 1972 ), P 32 4 K. Lynch, The Image of the dtp (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, i960), p. 1. 5 E. Fischer, The Necessity of Art (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1963), p. 8. according to the first Genesis narrative, God ordered the chaos and darkness. The six days of creation represent the giving of form to \u2018space\u2019 the void. When we say that a cosmos emerges from chaos we mean that there is now some discernible order, pattern and unity in place of the tohu ve bohu everything random and without meaning. Wim Wenders\u2019 Himmel \u00fcber Berlin shows the same process happening to the marshes which originally covered the site of that city, and the same could be said for any human settlement above a refugee camp. The second Genesis narrative envisages, in Day\u2019s words, the imbuing of matter with spirit, and therefore, on that understanding of art, characterises God as the archetypal artist. It would be possible then to argue, as some \u2018back to nature\u2019 theorists and deep ecologists seem to imply, that the less humankind interfere with this work of art the better. Alternatively it can be argued that human beings, in virtue of possessing \u2018spirit\u2019, share in the divine creativity. It is frequently remarked that in the contemporary world art has become a substitute for the transcendent. The valid reason for this (and it is a cultural movement which theology cannot endorse) is that human spirit responds to divine Spirit, and that in art, therefore, people do indeed sense rumours of angels or echoes of transcendence. As artists we do \u2018imbue matter with spirit\u2019 \u2014 one only has to look at some of the unfinished Michelangelo sculptures to see that. On a grander scale still some such understanding inspired Abbot Suger, the builder of Chartres, and doubtless countless other unknown medieval builders. Neither of these understandings of what constitutes art is quite identical with the process which Wolterstorff, probably rightly, identifies as the typical Western understanding of the artist. He traces that back to Augustine\u2019s understanding of God as giving free untrammelled expression to his inner self by bringing into existence new realities.7 But giving form, and imbuing matter with spirit, as I have just described it, are rather more modest activities. At least as far as human creation goes they imply respect for given materials. They are not Promethean. In describing art as the giving of \u2018form\u2019 I follow what I believe to be Aquinas\u2019 meaning as the imparting of significant shape to words, sound or matter. This understanding of form seems to me to avoid the critique of the concept developed by Heidegger.8 Form, he pointed out, was conventionally contrasted with content, and when applied to art suggested that what really mattered was not the form at all, but the meaning hidden 7 N. WolterstorfT, Artin Action (Carlisle: Solway, 1997), p. 51. 8 M. Heidegger, Basic Writings (London: Routledge, 1978), pp. 151fr. in the work of art, as in Hegel\u2019s discussion of representation and concept, in which the former is only an inferior prelude to the latter. Heidegger wants to find a way to allow the work of art to speak as a whole, just as it is, and not with the presupposition of a concealed appeal to its meaning, so that the truth of art is just that, and not something it is \u2018saying\u2019. In the same way, we can say, buildings do not make assertions.9 The protest against regarding art as a stepping stone to the \u2018really real\u2019 world of the concept is entirely justified, but it does not make the concept of form any the less inescapable. In his discussion of the Greek temple as a work of art Heidegger talks of the temple \u2018fitting together\u2019, \u2018gathering around itself a unity of paths and relations\u2019, and of the carvings \u2018entering into their distinctive shapes\u2019. He is talking of form emerging from the givenness of material rather than being mere passive matter for the artist\u2019s intentionality. We recall Loos\u2019 comment about the peasant house which \u2018emerges from the hand of God\u2019. This respect for matter does not mean we can eliminate intentionality. On the contrary, intentionality is implied in the very idea of art. What Heidegger\u2019s protest can teach us is that in the best art, as in vernacular building, let us say, there is a dialectic between material and intention, so that both in form the other. The doctrine of creation from nothing implies a break with Plato, but what Augustine still took from that tradition was his concern for order, proportion, shape and number. In this tradition it was believed that geometrical forms and ratios could lead human beings beyond the world of appearance to the ultimate divine order, and this was part of the inspiration of early Gothic building (though there is also a romanticism about Gothic which goes beyond this).10 Even more important, and the heart of the Gothic aesthetic according to Otto von Simson, was the belief that all light radiates from some primary source of radiance and glory. This accounts for the glorious windows of Gothic churches. The light of the windows in Chartres, for example, was not just beautiful, but was regarded as a sacrament and analogy for God.\" We are unlikely to subscribe to this metaphysic, but the moment we think about it we can see that the way in which light is used is a key aspect of the built 9 K. Harries, The Ethical Function ofArchitecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), p. 88, summarising Roger Scruton. 10 The twentieth century architect Le Corbusier shared this view, believing that the proper use of geometry could help bring about human integration. C. Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture (London: The Architectural Press, 1965), pp. 2off. 11 O. von Simson, The Gothic Cathedral (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1956), pp. 50 5. The source of this kind of thinking was Pseudo Dionysius, \u2018The Divine Names\u2019, ch. 4 in Pseudo Dionysius, TheComplete Works (New York: Paulist, 1987). Wolterstorffcommentsonthe importance of light in urban spaces. Art in Action, p. 181. environment, on the larger scale as well as in the design of dwellings. What would London be without the winter sunlight on its pale stone, or Delhi without the dawn light? If we think of the beauty of any village we know well, places of deep shade will inevitably play a key part. In the play of light and shade there is an essential movement of activity and repose without which we are not whole.12 In the thirteenth century, as the city began to gain in importance over the cathedral, Aristotle took his place alongside Plato, and his idea of the form which actualises substance became central.'3 This actualisation is close to what Heidegger means by the world \u2018worlding\u2019 itself. Form, for St Thomas, was at the heart of ideas of the beautiful. God is beautiful, and all creation shares to some extent in that beauty. There is, therefore, an ontological beauty to created reality to be explained by its origin in God. Created form \u2014 say, the form of a village street or a city square taps into that ontological beauty. In his Commentary on the Divine Names Thomas says: \u2018Beauty is a participation in the first cause, which makes all things beautiful. So that the beauty of creatures is simply a likeness of the divine beauty in which things participate.\u201914 The divine beauty is creative because it produces order and harmony, and \u2018it is always the case that whatever creatures may have in the way of communion and coming together, they have it due to the power of beauty... beauty is the effective cause of being and the exemplary cause of the created world\u2019.'5 Compare this with Heidegger\u2019s idea that art causes matter \u2018to come forth for the very first time\u2019. George Pattison contrasts a natural theology of art, based on humankind\u2019s natural endowments and capacities, and as such outside the sphere of grace, with one based on redemption. In the context of the theological framework which I argued for in the first chapter this distinction is impossible, as Pattison himself seems to demonstrate. He rightly denies the dualities of natural form and transcendent truth. What we think, feel, see, say, do or make \u2018enhances our capacity to affirm 12 Colour is an essential part of the aesthetic of the built environment. Places have their own distinctive hues, depending on the quality of the local stone or brick. \u2018Paris is grey; San Francisco is white.\u2019 In Jerusalem the facing of buildings with Jerusalem stone is law. S. Kostoff, The City Shaped (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1991), p 319 The difference it makes to emotional tone can be seen by contrasting the interior of Salisbury Cathedral (Purbeck, cold and blue) with the interior of Norwich (Caen stone, warm and pink). 13 Cf. Aquinas, in the Summa Contra Gentiles (11.54.6): \u2018In things composed of matter and form, neither the matter nor the form nor even being itself can be termed that which is. Yet the form can be called \u201cthat by which it is\u201d, inasmuch as it is the principle of being; the whole substance itself, however, is \u201cthat which is\u201d. And being esse) itself is that by which the substance is called a being (efts).' 14 U. Eco, The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas (London: Hutchinson, 1988), p. 30. 15 Ibid., p. 28. ourselves, our fellow human beings and our world as God\u2019s good gift in creation\u2019. To the extent that we are able to make such affirmations we stand already within the circle of redemption and of the fulfilment of the original judgement on creation: that God saw that it was good. Such movements of aesthetic enhancement of life constitute an awakening to the lure to participate in the divine dance \u2018from glory to glory advancing\u2019 and this is no less so when the content of such a movement is predominantly sensuous and material.'6 This is to understand redemption in the Irenaean perspective and, rightly, to see its profound integration with creation. The views about beauty which Thomas developed from the work of his teachers were, as Henry Adams, von Simson and Panofsky have all argued, instantiated in stone and glass in the medieval cathedrals. A little later, in northern and central Italy we have the creation of the great city centres which extend the argument into the secular arena. On the Platonic understanding this concern is not \u2018merely\u2019 aesthetic but also ethical. Plato had argued in The Republic that beauty which is measure, form and order, makes an impact on our souls. The Republic is essentially an inquiry into how to bring justice and beauty into human life together, and for Plato justice and beauty resemble one another, in that both involve proper order and relation. Justice was a matter of right relations both between the different parts of the community and the different parts of the individual soul. What today we might call integrity or \u2018being a whole person\u2019 was essential, in his view, to the well being of the community: a community of fragmented, disordered selves could not possibly be just. It is precisely the next move which is contentious, or even demonstrably untrue, however. For the implication would appear to be that beautiful architecture and music produces well ordered people, and vice versa, something we know to be false. For though high crime rates are correlated to poor environments, the fault is not with the environment as such, but with the social forces which create and sanction them. And on the other hand, it is quite possible to live in the heart of Venice or Siena, let\u2019s say and be a fascist. No simple relationship between ethics and environment can be established. Whilst this is indisputable it is also true that the human soul cries out for the nourishment of beauty and this has implications for the overall vision of a society.1 2 Medieval cities, and some Indian and Arab cities, had 1 G. Pattison, Art, Modernity and Faith (London: SGM, 1998), p. 135. 2 A concern for beauty is, says Harries, \u2018part of all human experience\u2019. Function, p. 20. religion as an artistic unifier. Eric Gill believed this was essential to artistic success. For him the great periods of art were the great periods of religion, and demanded a \u2018unanimous society with universal acceptance of a final cause outside material life which pervaded, directed and ruled it\u2019.11 have already spoken of the ambiguity of religion, and the contemporary world offers plenty of examples of the way in which it can dehumanise us. On the other hand it roots an aesthetic in an appeal to the transcendent, in other words to an overall purpose and meaning. But today, \u2018marketplace has replaced church as artistic unifier\u2019: The advertising art, the background art, the display art of our commercial establishments, presented to us on radio, on television, in newspapers, on billboards, through loudspeakers, is what today constitutes the art of our tribe as a whole. Where once the spire of the cathedral or the steeple of the church gave the first glimpse of city or village, today it is the Sears and Hancock buildings.2 This change in values raises the question of form and function. The dictum that \u2018form follows function\u2019 presupposes that we have a good function in the first place, as the Goodmans argued after the Second World War.3 \u2018Is the junction good? Bona fide? Is it worthwhile? Is it worthy of a man to do that? What are the consequences? Is it compatible with other, basic, human functions? Is it a forthright or at least ingenious part of life? Does it make sense? Is it a beautiful function of a beautiful power?\u20194 If the answer to these questions is \u2018No\u2019, as it is if the city is primarily market place, then we will not have beauty but on the contrary something which oppresses human beings, for this vision of the world leaves aside the question of justice and of shared ends. Without question our overall view of the meaning of life determines our built environment, as we can see by looking at medieval, Baroque and industrial cities. The Platonic unity of ethics and aesthetics is a fact of life. More prosaically, we get the architecture we deserve, and today, at worst, we have what Harries 1 E. Gill, The Necessity of Belief (London: Faber &amp; Faber, 1936), p. 337. 2 Wolterstorff, Art in Action, p. 2 3. 3 James Vance points out that the idea that form follows function was hardly an invention of the Bauhaus. Most earlier buildings instantiated it. \u2018In vast periods of human history, building has been predicated entirely on fulfilling a particular function in terms of the best technology then available.\u2019 J. E. Vance, Jnr, The Continuing City (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), p. 19. Papanek claims that the nineteenth century sculptor Horatio Greenough coined the phrase, and that it later became the guiding principle for the Viennese and German art and craft movements and only then for the Bauhaus. V Papanek, The Green Imperative (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 147. 4 P. Goodman and P. Goodman, Communitas: Means of Livelihood and WaysofLfe (New York: Random House, i960), p. 19. has called a \u2018playboy architecture\u2019, expressive of our ruling hedonism, or lack of purpose.1 If the question of value is at the heart of aesthetics, then education is vital for its recognition. Kevin Lynch talks of the \u2018legibility\u2019 of a cityscape: the ease with which its parts can be recognised and can be organised into a coherent pattern. For him the shape of the city is part of that education in attention which is central to the ethics of Simone Weil and Iris Murdoch: In the development of the image, education in seeing will be quite as important as the reshaping of what is seen. Indeed, they together form a circular, or hopefully a spiral, process: visual education impelling the citizen to act upon his visual world, and this action causing him to see even more acutely. A highly developed art of urban design is linked to the creation of a critical and attentive audience. If art and audience grow together, then our cities will be a source of daily enjoyment to millions of their inhabitants.23 Here the assumed relation is between the development of critical faculties and political acumen, but it is even more true of our wider spiritual life. Escape from the banality which threatens to envelop us (not least in church) is impossible without such education. Christopher Day argues that we have become used to the idea that money may be spent to beautify places for recreation and leisure but that places of work or for practical activities should be shaped by utilitarian considerations. \u2018The implication is that if half one\u2019s life is spent as efficiently but inartistically as possible, the other half is free to be artistic and inefficient.\u201924 The problem with this is that it is unsatisfying to, and ultimately damages and trivialises, humankind\u2019s spiritual nature. We are so accustomed to invert the medieval order, and thus to either ignore or give secondary place to the reality of the spiritual, that it seems almost pietistic to make this point. In this regard the example of Rudolf Bahro, the East German socialist and Green activist, is instructive. Towards the end of his life Bahro, a life long atheist, came to believe that only a new spirituality could deal with the death wish of Western technocracy. Far from being an optional extra he saw that \u2018spirituality\u2019, what is often now called \u2018the imaginary\u2019, is actually what shapes our world. Christopher Day challenges his readers to find an ecologically healthy place which is not also beautiful, by which he means nourishing to the spirit. This definition of the beautiful seems to me more 24 Day, Places, p. 26. 1 Harries, Function, p. 3. helpful in relation to the built environment than one derived from the tradition of contemplation. We cannot expect to experience the same aesthetic delight in a village or city street that we do when regarding a Botticelli painting, but we certainly know when they are nourishing to the spirit. \u2018For too long\u2019, says Day, \u2018townscape has been dominated by the accidental consequence of compartmentalized accommodations of material needs.\u2019 Can we, he asks, as shapers of the built environment, offer as wide and symbiotic a range of spirit nourishment as can healthy landscapes?25 For a proper understanding of how the spiritual shapes our world we need what David Harvey has called a \u2018utopianism of social process\u2019. The Victorian visionaries like Howard, Geddes or Unwin all believed that the key to social problems was the right social form, in so doing privileging things and spatial forms over social process. What is needed, on the other hand, is a recognition of how the material embeddedness of spatial structures stands in tension with the fluidity of social \u2014 and therefore spiritual \u2014 processes.26 We have to seek what Lefebvre calls a \u2018pedagogy of space\u2019. \u2018To build a few blocks of flats that are spiral in form by adding a handful of curves to the usual concrete angularities\u2019, says Lefebvre, \u2018is not an entirely negligible achievement but neither does it amount to very much.\u2019 To take inspiration from Andalusia, and demonstrate a sensual use of curvatures, spirals, arabesques and inflexions of all kinds, so achieving truly voluptuous spaces, would be a different matter altogether. Neither the plant world nor the mineral world has as yet delivered itself of all the lessons it holds regarding space and the pedagogy of spaceN This is profoundly theologically suggestive, for what the Christian scriptures present us with is an account of the pedagogy of the Spirit. Too often this has been read on a purely intellectual level, but Lefebvre rightly argues that such a pedagogy is at the same time, and necessarily, a pedagogy of space, of the built environment. What do we learn when we look at the environment we actually have? Different forms of settlement village, town, city, suburb all have their own aesthetic, but there is also an overlap in aesthetic categories between them. I shall try to understand these on the lines of a theological aesthetic through creation, nahalah or stakeholding, power and community. 25 Ibid., p. 182. 26 D. Harvey, Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), pp. 418 19. 27 H. Lefebvre, The Production of Space (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991), p. 397 (my italics). THE AESTHETICS OF CREATION Part of the perennial appeal of Gothic is its use of natural form \u2014 the tracery of leaves, the lines of trees and branches.1 Earlier we saw Simon Fairlie\u2019s dictum that \u2018nature abhors a straight line\u2019. The natural world trees, plants, rivers, coastlines, hills \u2014 is sinuous and uneven. As humankind\u2019s primeval environment, it invites imitation, contrasting with the severe lines imposed on buildings and landscapes by human will. Mumford made a fundamental distinction between organic and mechanical forms of growth, which corresponds, to some extent, with romantic and rationalistic approaches to society, and therefore to art.2 Part of the contrast between organic and planned is the contrast between Gothic and classical aesthetics.3Norberg Schulz distinguishes romantic, cosmic and classical city forms. Gothic is the essence of the former, where space is topological rather than geometrical and the basic configuration is the dense and indeterminate cluster and the free and varied row. Nature is what provides the inspiration. Islamic architecture instantiates the second, shunning sculptural presence and tending to dematerialised forms, whilst Greek architecture with its imageability and articulate order instantiates the last. In practice, he notes, most cities combine all three.4' In his view, \u2018all cities... have to possess something of all these categories of meaning to make urban dwelling possible\u2019.5 The principle underlying organic growth, says Christopher Day, is that the physical form grew out of activities, out of the meeting of users and environment.33 This had two senses. In the first place, Sitte associated the pleasingness of organic design with the social use of city form. His 1 Most obvious in windows, and above all the \u2018Jesse window\u2019, depicting Christ\u2019s descent from Jesse in tracery. 2 In chapter 4 I quoted Adolf Loos\u2019 encomium on the peasant house. The passage goes on: \u2018Ah, what is that? A false note in this harmony. Like an unwelcome scream. In the centre, beneath the peasants\u2019 homes which were created not by them but by God, stands a villa. Is it the product of a good or bad architect? I do not know. I only know that peace, tranquillity and beauty are no more... Why does the architect both good and bad violate the lake? Like almost every town dweller, the architect possesses no culture. He does not have the security of the peasant to whom this culture is innate. The town dweller is an upstart. I call culture that balance of inner and outer man which alone can guarantee rational thought and action. Architecture, 1910\u2019 in The Architecture of Adolf Loos, an Arts Council exhibition (London: Arts Council, 1985), p. 8. 3 3 \u00b0 Perhaps the major contrast in understandings of beauty in the built environment is between those for whom \u2018beautiful\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018broad and straight\u2019 (classical) and those for whom it means sinuous, small scale and detailed. Cf. Kostoff\u2019s remarks on the differences between fifteenth century Siena and Florence City, p. 70). 4 C. Norberg Schulz, Genius Loci (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), pp. 68 76. In particular the Gothic cathedral united romantic and cosmic qualities and the Baroque garden palace cosmic and classical. 5 Ibid., p. 77. 33 Day, Places, p. 95. preference for public squares, and the right choice and disposition of structures in and around them, rested on the perception that they had to serve a vital purpose for community life. But secondly he also liked the irregularities in old planning because \u2018they were not conceived on the drafting board but developed gradually in natura, allowing for all that the eye notices in natura and treating with indifference that which would be apparent only on paper\u2019.1 \u2018Nature\u2019 also provided the context for the whole.2 Of course appeals to \u2018nature\u2019 can be a mask for all forms of historical prejudice, but there are good grounds, as Lefebvre also suggests, for once again learning to read what the medieval theologians called the \u2018book of nature\u2019 and making use of those lessons in the built environment.3 As the outcome of this pedagogy Lefebvre anticipated the creation (or production) of a planet wide space as \u2018the social foundation of a transformed everyday life open to myriad possibilities\u2019.4 Hitherto there is little enough evidence for that, but it would be part of the unlearning of that art which has, since at least the seventeenth century, been a manifestation of the libido dominandi a theme I shall return to in the next chapter. Beginning with the rise of picturesque in the eighteenth century there grew up a theory of \u2018organic\u2019 architecture and planning. Many older towns supposedly followed the tracings of the cows\u2019 path, which produced, according to Mumford, a more economical and sensible layout than that of planned towns.5 \u2018In organic planning one thing leads to another and what began as a seizure of an accidental advantage may 1 C. Sitte, City Planning According to Artistic Principles (London: Phaidon, 1965; first published Vienna, 1889), p. 50. Sitte argued that city planning should not be merely a technical matter, but \u2018in the truest and most elevated sense\u2019 an artistic enterprise, (pp. 3\u20144). He meant this in a romantic, anti formal sense. \u2018To approach everything in a strictly methodical manner\u2019, he said, \u2018and not to waver a hair\u2019s breadth from preconceived patterns, until genius has been strangled to death and joie de vivre stifled by the system \u2014 that is the sign of our time... We have at our disposal three major methods of city planning, and several subsidiary types. The major ones are the gridiron system, the radial system and the triangular system... Artistically speaking, not one of them is of any interest, for in their veins pulses not a single drop of artistic blood\u2019 p. 91). 2 Ibid., p. 16. Sitte\u2019s ideas currently enjoy renewed approbation, but Harvey reminds us that Sitte turned to Wagner for spiritual inspiration, and the spaces Sitte championed and created, specifically for the purpose of re awaking the sense of community, lent themselves to fascism. \u2018The dramatic spectacles of the sort the Nazis organized certainly brought space alive and managed to appeal to a deep mythology of place, symbolizing \u201ccommunity\u201d, but community of a most reactionary sort.\u2019 D. Harvey, The Condition of Postmodernity (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989), p. 277. 3 So Harries, Function, pp. 114, 133 in an argument which echoes Barth\u2019s suspicion of natural theology, but also endorses the medieval view. 4 Lefebvre, Production, p. 397. 5 L. Mumford, The City in History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p. 346. It is true that, as he points out, the imposition of straight lines on hilly sites like San Francisco puts \u2018a constant tax\u2019 on human energy (p. 482). prompt a strong element in a design which an a priori plan could rule out.\u20191 The organic approach, then, \u2018springs out of the total situation\u2019, and works cooperatively with the \u2018materials of others\u2019, perhaps guiding them, but first acknowledging their existence and understanding their purpose.2 In the organic view the citywas \u2018enveloped by sky and earth, at once nurtured and held in check by this primordial frame\u2019.3' Responding to these principles architects influenced by the picturesque adapted their building to the terrain, as in Bath after 1727, and in Edinburgh after 17 67, or introduced deliberate breaks in rectilinearity as in Nash\u2019s Regent Street. Sitte\u2019s references to the following of nature suggest a natural theology, but we need to use that term with care. It should not suggest the attempt to elaborate a theology independently of revelation. On the contrary, it represents here the attempt to discern and respond to the revelation of God in creation.4 Had Sitte and Mumford read the evidence correctly, however? In his great history of form in architecture, The City Shaped, Spiro Kostoff calls organic theories into question. Siena, for example, a copybook example of a supposedly \u2018organic\u2019 plan, has \u2018one of the most highly regimented designs of medieval urbanism\u2019.5 In most cities, he argues, the organic and the planned are jumbled together. Roman cities in northern Europe, for example, were depopulated after the fifth century ad, and then slowly re populated, a process which left the original grid scarcely visible. The organic analogy, Kostoff claims, can be traced to the rise of biology as a life science in the seventeenth century, but it is inept. Cities do not repair themselves, but are produced and repaired by human will.44 What is really meant by \u2018organic\u2019 planning is planning that responds to its site hill, river, sea front or to land division prior to settlement, as in Leeds; to the coming together of several villages, as Aristotle proposed, or to the process of piecemeal changes over centuries. The sum of all these processes can produce a built environment dramatically different to 1 Ibid., p. 347. 2 Ibid., p. 450. 3 Kostoff, Gfiy, p. 324. 2 42 In Cities of God (London: Routledge, 2000) Graham Ward detects a natural theology in Le 3 Corbusier\u2019s belief in \u2018universal laws that govern us and all our actions\u2019, and in the famous chapel at Ronchamp (p. 41). To me these seem to be two different things. At Ronchamp Le Corbusier 4 breaks dramatically from his normal mode, finding inspiration in the natural world. This is an \u2018organic\u2019 building His geometricism is, as already noted, closer to the Neo Platonism of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Harries agrees, pointing out that Le Corbusier began as a disciple of Sitte, and at Ronchamp returned to him (Function, p. 276). On the other hand, KostofF (City, p. 89) points out the Nazi passion for organic architecture, as instantiated by Reichow. His defence of organic architecture is reminiscent of Heidegger\u2019s account of the German farmhouse, and both show the danger of identifying what is \u2018natural\u2019 with the \u2018volF, making of it an ideology. 5 Kostoff, City, p. 10. 44 Ibid., pp. 52 3. that produced by imperial planners, and this is what Sitte and Mumford appealed to. So called organic plans instantiate an aesthetic of surprise. Mumford cited Alberti: \u2018Within the heart of the town it will be handsomer not to have the streets straight but winding about several ways, backwards and forwards, like the course of a river.\u2019 Note, again, the appeal to a natural feature. Defence was part of this but it also meant that the passenger will \u2018at every step discover a new structure, and the front and door of every house will directly face the middle of the street\u2019 inviting an inspection of the richness of carved detail.1 Against geometrised blocks Sitte defended \u2018the small incident, the twisted street, the rounded corner, the little planted oasis unexpectedly come upon\u2019 2 Wolter storff notes that the failure to impart dramatic sequence to one\u2019s movements through a city, to introduce variety and unity right into the sequence of one\u2019s movements, renders it aesthetically poor.3 The medieval city did this to a superlative degree. It also had the advantage of comparative smallness of scale and absence of traffic, and the whole was a system of limitations and boundaries. As Ruskin argued, in The Stones of Venice, attention to detail stretched even to the stones hidden from view. The craftsmen who built the city had, Mumford argued, an incomparable education of the senses in the fields or woods through which they walked to work or took the frequent holidays of medieval society. \u2018Aesthetic discipline might lack a name... but its fruits were everywhere visible.\u201948 The key to their aesthetic was, then, the marriage of town and country. It was this Howard wanted to recapture in his vision for the Garden City, built around a great park, layered with fields, and surrounded by green belt. Jerusalem was to be situated in Eden. Howard\u2019s model was not intended to be a suburb, but on the contrary to contain urban sprawl in a purposeful way, but the coming of mass transport changed this. Howard envisaged homes, farms and industry all clustered together, but the possibility of commuting led to zoning, and the Garden Cities effectively becoming dormitories. Their aesthetic qualities were essentially suburban. Geddes argued that the change from coal to electricity would lead to the slums being replaced by Garden Cities. \u2018Yet the old slum towns have largely passed away to be replaced by endless conurbations of suburbs... and the automobile exhaust is more of a menace than the coal smoke.\u201949 1 Alberti, The Ten Books of Architecture (New York: Dover, 1986), p. 75; cf. Mumford, City, p. 351. 2 Kostoff, City, p. 84. 3 Wolterstorf Y, Art in Action, p. 181. 48 Mumford, City, pp. 342\u20143. 3 49 Goodman and Goodman, Communitas, p. 8. The purest example of organic form is probably to be found in the village. These may sometimes be planned,1 but in most cases they probably represent the sum of a multitude of human decisions, from the original one to settle there, to each decision about the adding of a new house, church, chapel or pub, each decision responding to natural features, the presence of a tree or a stream, and to established patterns of ownership. Can the result be considered art? These decisions were probably rarely consciously aesthetic. The result, however, said Charles Buis, mayor of Brussels at the end of the nineteenth century and a champion of the city\u2019s old quarters, is \u2018a peculiar charm for all who are not insensible to artistic impressions. They may not be called beautiful, but they are attractive; they please by that beautiful disorder that here results not from art but from chance.\u20192 In most small villages in Europe the most imposing building is likely to be the church, and it remains important, even in a secular age, as the bearer of \u2018heritage\u2019, as telling the story of those who shaped this settlement before us. But fine buildings are not what make the beauty of a village. In Sladd, Laurie Lee\u2019s village, where the church is an unremarkable Victorian building, only the Squire\u2019s house really has artistic pretensions. Today, however, this does not stand out as one of the most attractive houses in the village. The beauty of the village, wrote Sharp, lies \u2018in the form, in the ground plan, which the buildings and natural objects together make\u2019.3 In his view form was the key aspect of the beauty of the built environment, and simplicity of form of the village. Sharp distinguished two types of village, roadside and square. The old roadside village, unlike ribbon development, which he loathed, \u2018begins definitely and ends definitely\u2019. \u2018English roadside villages seem somehow to contain their road rather than to be merely a string of buildings pushed aside by it. The road may curve gently away from the straight or it may take a sharp and sudden turn; in either case the village is thereby transformed into a place.\u20194 This may have been true in 1932, when it was written, but for many villages motor traffic has changed it for good. Sladd is a roadside village, now situated on a busy B road, with a line of traffic parked to allow the faithful to visit their shrines school, pub and cottage. Whilst Sharp\u2019s comment may have been true when the road was white and rutted, tarmac, and the speed 1 Milton Abbas, in Dorset, laid out by Capability Brown, is one example. Most British mining villages were built on the cheapest row plan by the mill owners. 2 Cited in KostofT, City, p. 84. 3 5 2 T. Sharp, \u2018The English Village\u2019, inT. Sharp, E Gibberd and W. Holford ,Designin Town and Village (London: HMSO, 1953), p. 1. 4 Ibid., p. 3. with which you are forced to pass through it, have now transformed it into a rather straggly ribbon settlement. The other type of village, which survives motor traffic much better, is built round the square, or the triangle at the junction of three roads. Drewsteignton, in Devon, is an example, with its classic combination of pubs, church and small shops and houses, the remaining houses reaching out like fingers down the hills on which it stands. The rural feeling of the village, Sharp argued, does not depend on any of those things that are popularly associated with it: flowering gardens, irregular, informal and quaint buildings, and so on. \u2018It seems to depend on much smaller and more subtle things, upon a certain modesty, a certain lack of the smooth, mechanical finish of the town, and above all upon the harmony of the material of its buildings with the countryside.\u20191 In other words, he denies that an aesthetic of charm is at the heart of it, but rather one of harmony. Rapoport does not contradict this in saying that a village environment implies a variety of architecture and a degree of incoherence: different styles, materials of roof pitches, buildings at different angles, interesting and intimate groupings, natural vegetation, mixed age and income and lack of uniformity.2 3 Incoherence and lack of uniformity by no means exclude harmony, the fittingness which Wolterstorff finds at the heart of art. Sharp is pointing to the same thing in speaking of the \u2018simplicity and unity, and dignity of thought\u2019 of old villages. Planners, he said, should pay great respect to the traditional features of form and appearance, springing from simplicity of function and smallness of scale. The traditional form of the village is so good for its purpose that even our new villages should be based on it.5\u00ae Part of the secret of village beauty is the way in which the ordinary buildings respect the environment, and differ according to local conditions and materials. They represent the vernacular writ large. In the Gotswold villages between Burford and Cirencester, in England, for example, what is beautiful is the way the settlements are sunk into their landscape, camouflaged, so that they seem to grow out of the soil rather 1 T. Sharp, Town and Countryside (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1932), p. 67. 2 A. Rapoport, The Meaning of the Built Environment (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1990), P 157 3 5 6 Cited in W. P. Baker, The English Village (London: Oxford University Press, 1953), p. 206. To Sharp\u2019s horror this was often threatened by popular taste. He put this question to the young planners he was training at the end of the Second World War: The parish council of an old agricultural village is proposing that the pond at one side of the village green should be made into a model yacht pond with a fountain in the middle, and that concrete paths and flower beds should be laid out round it. Set out your reasoned advice. \u2018Ninetyfive per cent elaborated their refinements of vulgarity to almost unendurable degrees\u2019 (ibid.). than to be imposed on it. The villages of the Pennines, on the other hand, have the windswept clarity of upland light, the beauty of the moorland which surrounds them. The fishing villages on the east coast of Fife emerge from the rocks which form their small harbours, braced against the onshore winds, whilst the Cornish fishing villages nestle round their coves. In each case, according to Sharp, \u2018the essence of true village character and good village design is simply simplicity\u2019.1 In these ways they instantiate an aesthetics of creation, responding sympathetically to the environment, rather than trying to \u2018tame\u2019 it, which would be true, too, for the cities Kostoff discusses under \u2018organic\u2019 forms. THE AESTHETIC OF MAHALAH In the third chapter I mentioned the concept of nahalah, the idea that every family in Israel was a stakeholder, and could expect to settle \u2018under its vine and fig tree\u2019. In the discussion of the human dwelling I mentioned the view that suburbia was perhaps the most perfect instantiation of this dream ever known. The suburban aesthetic is the most difficult to discuss, whether theologically or otherwise, and I have sought to comprehend it under this category. It draws inspiration from the rediscovery of gothic, and at its best seeks to evoke the village, but it remains essentially the aesthetic of the small owner, the individual marking out his or her plot, doing what they can with modest resources. As there is no one city form, so there is no one suburban, but there are dominant features. Nash\u2019s Park Villages, built on the fringe of Regent\u2019s Park in 1824, were, it is generally agreed, a product of the picturesque movement in landscape gardening, and therefore a product of romanticism. They differ from the eighteenth century town house not in having a garden, for gardens had been a normal part of town life at least since medieval times, but in emphasising difference. They are self consciously romantic, expressing the ideal of rus in urbe. The same cultural turn which produced Walter Scott\u2019s novels produced the 1842 pattern book which offered, amongst others, \u2018burmese\u2019, \u2018egyptian\u2019, \u2018Venetian\u2019, \u2018moriso\u2019, \u2018Spanish\u2019 and Plantagenet Castle styles. Tudor gables were already being offered in the 1830s.2 Later developments like Unwin\u2019s New Earswick were designed to recall village life, and trees and a brook were integrated into the design. As late as 1944 the Dudley report recommended 1 Sharp, \u2018The English Village\u2019, p. 19. 2 A. Edwards, The Design of Suburbia (London: Pembridge, 1981), pp. 13, 15. sharawaggi, a word derived from a transliteration of the Chinese term for irregular gardening. The basis of sharawaggi was \u2018to plan irregularly, to disdain formality, to contrive beauties that shall be great and strike the eye, but without any order or disposition of parts as shall be commonly or easily observed, to improve a scene according to the manner suggested by itself, and without regard to symmetrical arrangement\u2019. The report represented, says Edwards, a rediscovery of the principles of Sitte, an application of the landscape architect\u2019s preoccupation with \u2018genius loci\u2019.1 There are obvious affinities with organic planning. The difference between the organic towns of the middle ages and modern suburbia, says Kostoff, is that in the medieval town rich and poor lived side by side, whilst suburbs were effectively zoned by class.2 The problem for suburbia came in its increasing generalisation, and the need to provide mass housing at a relatively low cost. This produced an aesthetic which I will call debased romanticism. The rows and rows of Dunroamin\u2019s, Coniston\u2019s and Bidawee\u2019s border on kitsch if they do not actually instantiate it. The need to economise led to the penchant for weatherboarding, for creosoted boards to suggest mock Tudor, and renderings to allow for difference at modest expense. It was universally agreed to be a dull pattern of architecture, for penny pinching is almost inevitably dull in its results. James Richards, who was a defender of suburbia, understood it as basically anarchic. \u2018It is typical of the suburban scene\u2019, he wrote, \u2018that it is an accumulation of trivialities; the novelties of this year are always being added to the novelties of last year, and these are always fading into insignificance until they are ready to emerge again in the character of the old and familiar things that we wondered at in childhood.\u20193' He felt that this represented an authentic continuation of the picturesque tradition, continued by amateur gardeners, landscapists, decorators and handymen.4 Twentieth century suburbia was, in his view, a response to a world made unsafe for self sufficiency. Suburban architecture is the attempt to create a kind of oasis in which everything can be accounted for and the unpredictable excluded.\u00ae3 The suburb gives to people a sense of belonging to a fairly sympathetic world and an opportunity of making 1 Ibid., p. 156. 2 KostotT, City, p. 75. 2 61 J. M. Richards, Castles on the Grounel: The Anatomy of Suburbia (London: John Murray, 197 3), p. 43. Gf. Hall: \u2018The suburban house was designed to express individuality; hence the bay window and the corner door, the great variation in very minor detail.\u2019 P. Hall, Cities of Tomorrow (Oxford: 3 Blackwell, 1988), p. 79. 4 Richards, Castles, p. 67. Ibid., p. 36. out of that world something personal to themselves an outlet for their idealistic and creative instincts.1 The early high class suburbs represented a reaction against Georgian design. In the Georgian estate, Edwards comments, the buildings were repetitious, but the scene as a whole possessed variety. In the Victorian villa suburbia the buildings were varied but the scene as a whole was repetitious. The Victorians failed to see, he says, that the quality of a scene is less a matter of the forms of its buildings than of the scale of its constituents, the nature of its floorscape and the character of its spaces.2 He identified five problems with suburban aesthetics: duality of content, which is an inevitable aspect of the suburban ideal except at arcadian densities; its monotony, caused by the need to provide large estates of virtually identical buildings; its weakness of scale, caused by the fact that economy and convenience set a limit of two stories to the height of these dwellings, while the cost of land, the need to avoid overshadowing, and the householder\u2019s preference for private, rather than communal gardens, deny suburbia the space for tall forest trees; its resdess silhouette and formless spaces, which result from a multiplicity of detached or semi detached houses, and its fragmented floorscape which is caused by man\u2019s desire for a garden beside his home, together with the drives and carriageways that are a necessary concomitant of a garage.3 It is difficult to deny these problems. There are, of course, exceptions, especially those associated with Unwin and Parker and those inspired by them, but they are mostly upper middle class by virtue of the pressure on land. If we are to make sense of them according to a theological aesthetic it will have to be in terms of what individual creativity makes possible in them. THE AESTHETICS OF POWER The underlying theological problem with modern architecture, says John de Gruchy, has been that \u2018it was too vulnerable to ideological manipulation by those opposed to the common good\u2019.67 This, however, is not a modern but an ancient problem. It was already obvious in Hellenistic and Roman times, and was typified in Baroque. Twentieth century tyrannies looked back admiringly to these models. All forms of absolutism have favoured an architecture of power and display \u2014 long, straight avenues crowned by a triumphal arch or leading to a majestic building 1 Ibid., pp. 38 9. 2 Edwards, Design, p. 20. 66 Ibid., p. 259. 2 67 J. de Gruchy, Christianity, Art and Transformation (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 3 p. 189. symbolising the power of the State, the Empire or the Church.68 As opposed to organicism a completely different approach to the natural world is implied. Even in the medieval city the skyline was marked with towers and spires, but these spoke of the heavenly city to which the earthly city aspired.69 Once technology made skyscrapers possible, the skyline \u2018described a premeditated human order, one indebted solely to technology and the profit seeking designs of man\u2019, embodying \u2018an element of choice and boast\u2019.70 The city became a monument to human pride. All these cities have a shadow side, in what happens to those who are displaced by the planner\u2019s T square, in which \u2018the basis of a whole tissue of habits and social relations\u2019 could be ruthlessly torn down.71 Kostoff cites a note from the period of Sixtus V\u2019s rebuilding of Rome: \u2018Those poles placed throughout the city in straight lines across vineyards and gardens bring fear to the souls of many interested persons who are not unaware that, in order to make roads without turnings, many a neck has to be twisted.\u201972 The villains of this activity are not just secular rulers or tyrants, but include many churchmen and popes. The prophetic critique of the building habits of the rich (Amos 5.11) is here writ large. Fine streets and squares were built which contributed nothing \u2018to the order of the rest of the city, whose population lived at a lower economic level and was housed... in accord with a different principle in which neither taste nor health nor family life was a consideration\u2019.73 The values represented were not common values but those of power and prestige. The one real contribution to the ordinary citizen, in Mumford\u2019s view, was the generalisation of the great park. Originally aristocratic gardens, the Baroque, and later imperial, city integrated them within the whole, thus keeping \u2018the aristocratic concept of space and verdure as an essential part of urban life\u2019.74 Because power and display were the goal the image of the theatre was obvious. In Paris, said John Evelyn, the houses were built \u2018so incomparably fair and uniform, that you would imagine your self rather in some Italian Opera, where the diversity of Scenes surprise the beholder, then believe your self to be in a real! Citie \u2019.75 He did not draw the conclusion that 88 Kostoff notes (City, p. 217) that it was \u2018the presumption of absolute power\u2019 which explains the appeal of the Grand Manner to the totalitarian regimes of the Thirties. ^9 Bloch denies this, finding medieval spires likewise an expression of pride. E. Bloch, The Principle of Hope, tr. N. Plaice, S. Plaice and P. Knight (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 715. But do they not continue the echoing of the natural we find in the interior of the cathedral, trees straining up to the light? 70 Kostoff, City, p. 324. 71 Mumford, City, p. 442. 72 Kostoff, City, p. 220. 73 Mumford, City, p. 456. 74 Ibid., p. 436. 75 Cited in Kostoff, City, p. 224. the result was rather similar, namely that, unlike the medieval town, a Baroque town can be taken in almost at a glance.1 This meant that the effect of these plans was the opposite of what was planned. They did of course announce absolute power and limitless money but \u2018[tjhese long avenues serve as a diminishing glass; in the long perspectives of Versailles or St Petersburg, the central human figure, King or Tsar, became ever smaller and soon reached his political vanishing point\u2019.2 The arch theoretician of the aesthetic of power in the twentieth century was Le Corbusier. No one has made it clearer how architectural visions rest on a view of the human. Far from presenting us with an architectural natural theology, what he represents is a late version of the Enlightenment religion of reason. Just as for him a house was a machine for living, so a town was a tool. Salvation lay in geometry, which expressed everything that was truly human over against wayward nature.3 In a famous jibe at organicism he compared a town which followed the lines of the pack donkey with one dictated by reason. \u2018The pack donkey meanders along, meditates a little in his scatter brained and distracted fashion, he zigzags in order to avoid the larger stones, or to ease the climb... he takes the line of least resistance. But man governs his feelings by his reason.\u20194 For Le Corbusier the picturesque was boring and sentimental.5 To be human is to go straight for your goal; a straight line symbolises self mastery.6' The analogy with the fascist triumph of the will is obvious. The right angle is the essential and sufficient implement of action, because it enables us to determine space with an absolute exactness.7 Haussmann, who demolished much of medieval Paris, was a special hero.8 To his credit Le Corbusier saw that what we now call the destruction of greenfield sites was a problem. The answer was simple: increase the 1 Mumford, City, p. 446. 2 Ibid., p. 447. 2 78 \u2018Geometry is the means, created by ourselves, whereby we perceive the external world and express the world within us. Geometry is the foundation. It is also the material basis on which we build those symbols which represent to us perfection and the divine.\u2019 The layout of the city must be purely geometrical. \u2018The city of today is a dying thing because it is not geometrical. To build in the open is to replace our present haphazard arrangements... by a uniform layout. Unless 3 we do this there is no salvation.\u2019 G. Le Corbusier, The City of Tomorrow and its Planning (London: The Architectural Press, 1971; first published as Urbanisme in 1925), pp. 1, 171. He is looking to the idea of beauty Plato set out in the Philebus. 4 Ibid., p. 210. 5 Ibid. 5 81 Or perhaps just mastery. \u2018The true message of the skyscraper in America\u2019, said Kostoff, \u2018was the 6 celebration of one man\u2019s enterprise\u2019 City, p. 327). 7 Le Corbusier, City, p. 19. 8 83 Ibid., p. 154. \u2018It seemed as if Paris would never endure his surgical experiments. And yet today does it not ex ist merely as a consequence of his daring and courage?\u2019 open spaces and diminish the distances to be covered. Construct the city vertically.1 The basic principles for city planning were de congestion of the centre, increasing of density, increasing the means for getting about, and increasing parks and open spaces.2 At the base of the skyscrapers would be a great open space filled with restaurants, cafes and luxury shops. Where Unwin was preaching that \u2018nothing was gained by over crowding\u2019 Le Corbusier sought higher densities. \u2018We are fond of the crowd and the crush because we are human beings and like to live in groups. In such towns... with a denser population than that of existing cities, there would be ample provision and opportunity for close human contact.\u20193 There was a side to Le Corbusier which sympathised with the ideals of the Garden City. He recognised that his tower blocks transcended human scale. \u2018We are still creatures of nature and vast buildings would crush us if there were no common measure between them and ourselves.\u2019 His solution was to fill his parks with trees. The tree is \u2018a sort of caress, a kindly thing in the midst of our severer creations\u2019.4 Despite this recognition, he still represents high modernism with a vengeance. Glorifying the machine, he took his aesthetic from the air.5 In that case, as the Goodmans remarked, \u2018the resources of architecture are helpless\u2019.6 And as David Harvey observes, we find here \u2018a subterranean celebration of corporate bureaucratic power and rationality, under the guise of a return to surface worship of the efficient machine as a sufficient myth to embody all human aspirations\u2019.90 Stalinist architecture was a version of this form of rationality. During this period an aesthetic emerged, says Gordon Church, \u2018based in functionalism as symbolizing rationalism and focused on an ethic of design affirming a social commentary\u2019. He talks, apparently without irony, of an \u2018aesthetic of propaganda\u2019. In Stalinist Bucharest: 1 Ibid., p. 163. 85 Ibid., p. 166. 86 Ibid., p. 240. 2 87 Ibid., p. 237. \u2018How to make people feel at home in skyscraper cities, in cells in buildings 60 3 storeys high? The answer? We must plant trees... Why should not the new spirit in architecture... satisfy the deepest human desires by once more covering with verdure the urban 4 landscape?\u2019 (p. 80) 5 \u2018Instead of a flattened out and jumbled city such as the airplane reveals to us for the first time, terrifying in its confusion, our city rises vertical to the sky, open to light and air, clear and radiant and sparkling. The soil, of whose surface 70 to 80 per cent has till now been encumbered by closely packed houses, is now built over to the extent of a mere 5 per cent. The remaining 95 per cent is devoted to the main speedways, car parks and open spaces. The avenues of trees are doubled and quadrupled, and the parks at the foot of the skyscrapers do, in fact, make the city itself one vast garden\u2019 (ibid., p. 281). 6 P. Goodman and P. Goodman, Commumitas, p. 51. 90 Harvey, Condition, p. 36. The orientation of the design lay in the play of mass and movement, making positive social cum artistic statements like \u2018upwardness\u2019 or \u2018forwardness\u2019, solidarity of purpose, loyalty to the oppressed and to those that had died in protest, and the links between the worker and peasant. The particular idioms include the clenched fist, the tensed arm, the sober face, and the purposeful human figure... the statements are progress, peace, liberation, family, dynamism, and movement.1 Monumentality was a key feature, commemorating events and promoting socialist values. The reason the results were so grim was that the whole experiment was based on violence. From the beginning this manner of building sought to promote \u2018order\u2019. Roman cities set out a vision of the \u2018pax Romana\u2019 which in fact rested on terror. Not for nothing did Renaissance rulers, princes and popes go back to classical lines. Already in the fifteenth century Ferdinand of Naples was speaking of narrow streets as a \u2018danger to the State\u2019.2 It is the result of looking through the other end of the telescope to Alberti\u2019s praise of narrow streets as useful for defence. The enemy is now within, the undisciplined mob. Part ofHaussmann\u2019s intentions in Paris was to prevent another urban uprising such as had happened in 1848. He called the old quarter of Paris, which he demolished, \u2018the quarter of uprisings and barricades\u2019.3 Kostoff notes the use of rational planning by both colonial and Fascist governments to eradicate traditional living arrangements and with them loyalties that may be at odds with the State.4 The Warsaw Ghetto showed again that this could be true. At the end of the twentieth century another variant of the will to order was visible in the emergence of what Mike Davis has called the \u2018carceral city\u2019. In relation to Los Angeles he speaks of a \u2018totalitarian semiotics of ramparts and battlements, reflective glass and elevated pedways\u2019 which rebukes any affinity or sympathy between different architectural or human orders.95 The neo military syntax of contemporary architecture insinuates violence and conjures imaginary dangers.9\u00ae In this view he is joined by Crimp, who finds in postmodern architecture a new authoritarianism which expresses the will of the real estate developers.97 Roman triumphal avenues were laid out for triumphal armies. Baroque avenues were for the carriages of princes. By the eighteenth 1 G. Church, \u2018Bucharest: Revolution in the Townscape Art5, in R. French and F.

The medieval, or organic, city plan did not cater well for this rise in the volume of traffic. The advent of the motor car made the problem still more acute. For Le Corbusier, \u2018A city made for speed is made for success.\u20191 It was another reason for straight streets. \u2018The curve is ruinous, difficult, dangerous; it is a paralyzing thing.\u20192 Since crossroads are an enemy to traffic the number of streets should be diminished by two thirds. The car was the vehicle of aesthetic appreciation. \u2018A critic said on straight streets he would die of boredom. I was astounded and replied: \u201cYou have a car and yet you say that!\u201d \u20193\u00b0 The so called Athens Charter of 1933 believed traffic flow should be the primary determinant of city form.101 The result has been exactly what Mumford prophesied, namely that public and private space were divorced and the integrity of the city lost. For the Goodmans, urban beauty is a beauty of walking and has no place in the age of automobiles and aeroplanes. In that case, they remark, \u2018our city crowds are doomed to be lonely crowds, bored crowds, humanly uncultured crowds\u2019.102 There is a coda to this architecture of power for, briefly, the industrial revolution ushered in a period in which aesthetics were ruthlessly subordinated to profit. The \u2018Cities of dreadful night\u2019 of the industrial era were thrown up overnight in the need to accommodate the tens of thousands who flocked to them looking for work, and were not planned at all. Haeckel said that the gist of Darwin\u2019s theory was that nature evolves new species without design: It was by following what they presumed to be nature\u2019s way that the industrialist and the municipal officer produced the new species of town, a blasted, denatured man heap adapted, not to the needs of life, but to the mythic \u2018struggle for existence\u2019; an environment whose very deterioration bore witness to the ruthlessness and intensity of the struggle. There was no room for planning in the layout of these towns. Chaos does not have to be planned.103 This was the architectural equivalent of the free market. To make profit the only consideration meant \u2018the inexorable wiping out of all the natural features that delight and fortify the human soul in its daily rounds. Rivers would be turned into running sewers... waterfronts might be made inaccessible to the stroller, ancient trees might be slaughtered and venerable buildings torn down to speed traffic.\u2019104 The Garden City and the work of 1 Le Corbusier, City, p. 179. 2 Ibid., p. 16. 3 Ibid., p. 270. 2 101 Kostoff, City, p. 154. 102 Goodman and Goodman, Communitas, p. 51. 3 103 Mumford, City, p. 515 104 Ibid., p. 486. Sitte were a reaction to this, but there is also an architectural equivalent to the thesis of Veblen about conspicuous consumption. Veblen argued that whilst the first generation might prioritise capital, the second and third generations wanted to spend it.105 The nineteenth century town halls and museums of Britain are an ample exemplification of this thesis. That, very often, led back to the \u2018Grand Manner\u2019 which finally disappeared, according to Kostoff after the Second World War. When, in France, an attempt was made to utilise it in the interests of the working class, all that was achieved was an \u2018embalmed domesticity\u2019 as there was no public life which they celebrated.106 This points precisely to the reclamation of community as the secret of city aesthetic. THE AESTHETIC OF COMMUNITY People ensoul not only their houses but the settlements in which they dwell. At the same time their settlements shape their souls. We can once again understand this dialectic through theological anthropology. Human beings, said Barth, are soul and body in an order. \u2018As a person is grounded, constituted and maintained by God as soul of their body\u2019, he wrote, \u2018and thus receives and has the Spirit, there occurs the rule of the soul and the service of the body.\u2019 Human beings are constituted in this relationship.107 In terms of the built environment this means that the primacy is with the community rather than the place.108 This is the reason that the most unlikely places may become places of the soul refugee camps, slums, prisons, even concentration camps. On the other hand, there are places which we speak of as \u2018soulless\u2019, places which impoverish us; and places which have a deep spirituality, in the sense of being places which nurture the human soul. Following Plato\u2019s bringing together of ethics and aesthetics I want to go on and try to understand the elements of a creative aesthetic of space. In doing so I am once again using Walter Wink\u2019s account of spirituality. Most objects we are accustomed to call beautiful, says Kevin Lynch, such as a painting or a tree, are single purpose things. \u2018A city is a multi purpose, shifting organization, a tent for many functions, raised by many hands with relative speed... final meshing is improbable and 105 T Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York: Dover, 1994; orig 1899). 106 Kostoff, City, p. 276. 107 K.

What I am doing is reversing the claim. undesirable.\u20191 Lynch makes the point that cities, like villages and towns, are the work of many hands, the home of many communities. Many writers suggest that coherence is essential to an aesthetically pleasing urban space. \u2018Other things being equal\u2019, says Nicholas Wolterstorff, \u2018the more strongly unified the space, the better. When space is allowed to leak out all over, so that the degree of unity is very low, we can scarcely even experience it as shaped space. And other things being equal, the more rich, complex, varied, and contrasting the spaces, the better.\u20192 This doctrine of the unity of urban space needs to be treated with great caution for it might be taken to imply that the coherence of the various parts has to be planned. But richness, variety, complexity and contrast spring from \u2018the works of many hands\u2019 inspired by many different visions of the good life.3 A living city, then, will not have just one aesthetic and its space will rarely be artistically unified. It will, however, as we have seen before, have a spirituality, in the sense in which I have defined it, and it is this which provides the aesthetic unity of the city. Form alone does not constitute a beautiful city the Hellenistic cities or Versailles are instances of that.4 5 Leonie Sandercock justly insists that in the post war rush to turn planning into an applied science the city of memory, of desire, and of spirit was lost.\u201c3 She seeks a city aesthetic which has a much more overtly spiritual dimension than that which has emerged under the auspices of centralised planning. If we accept Day\u2019s definition of art as the imbuing of matter with spirit then the spirituality of the city is what determines whether we find it aesthetically satisfying or not. Within any great city there will be boring and exciting areas, ugly and beautiful, old and new, but the overall feel, the image of the city, as Lynch calls it, will be determined by this spirituality which is bound up with its community life. I want to propose five constituents of the image of the city, those things which make a place \u2018beautiful\u2019. First, respect for the natural environment plays its role. Many if not most human settlements group themselves around important natural features, like rivers, harbours, hills. Settlements can effectively deny such features, or they can appeal to them. Rivers can be culverted as a 1 2 111 Kjellberg argues that a diversity of aesthetic experience is the primary goal of urban aesthetics. 3 S. Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheohgy (Utrecht: International Books, 2000), p. 124. 4 Thus Mumford speaks of the Hellenistic cities as sanitary, orderly, well organised and aesthetically unified but grossly inferior in their capacity for fostering creative activity to the Greek cities they succeeded. City, p. 200. 5 L. Sandercock, Towards Cosmopolis (Chichester: John Wiley, 1998), p. 4. nuisance, or can have esplanades for walks.\"4 They can draw the eye to distant mountains or be buried under dockyard debris. The possibilities of hills for views, for parks, for walks, can be exploited or they can be comprehensively built over and become a nuisance for traffic.1'5 Villages and towns can give on to woods and fields which make them open to a different world.\"6 In Norberg Schulz\u2019s terms, settlements can \u2018gather\u2019 their regions, as Dundee, Scotland, \u2018gathers\u2019 the highly fertile area of the carse of Gowrie to the west, the rich farmland in Angus, the great mountainous plateau of the Cairngorms to the north, and above all the sea. Second, beautiful places exude life. Life can be quiet, as in many villages, or it can be teeming, but dead places, no matter how interesting the form, are like old fashioned museums. To use the image of Jane Jacobs, some forms of historical conservation amount to taxidermy. The chaos of an Indian market city, on the other hand, though full of rubbish, dirt, and poor quality buildings, can be profoundly beautiful. Similarly, John Turner found in Latin American favellas and barrios a quite remarkable struggle for beauty and resilience of spirit.\"7 Third, there needs to be respect for the past and for corporate memory. Leonie Sandercock talks of the need to recapture the importance of place and the art of place making; the local knowledges written into the stones and memories of communities.\"8 Without such memory we have a corporate version of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\"9 Some British cities were damaged in this way more by the post World War II craze for \u2018modernity\u2019 than by the bombs of the war. This is not to say that change is out of the question. Of course, \u2018 [t]he idea of somehow dismantling the urban infrastructures of Tokyo Yokohama or New York city overnight and starting all over again is simply ludicrous\u2019. There is, therefore, a certain sclerosis of the built environment.120 Since cities never stand still, however, there are always ways in which the aesthetics of place 114 In Idar Oberstein, in Germany, the river which was the heart of the medieval town has been concreted over and turned into a four lane highway, thus destroying the town\u2019s integrity. 115 In Edinburgh, for example, the hills are a vital part of the aesthetic, linking the city to the sea on one side and the mountains on the other. 116 Heidelberg is a good example. See, for example, \u2018Lima\u2019s Barriadas and Corralones: suburbs versus slums\u2019, Ekistics 19 (1965), pp. 152 5. 118 Sandercock, Postmetropolis, p. 4.. \"9 As Kostoff puts it, \u2018The mindless destruction of our old fabrics erases our cultural identity\u2019 (City&gt; p. 86). He later goes on, \u2018We cannot bring back the pre industrial world___much as we might yearn for it. We should be content with saving as much as we can, to know what we once had and to add our own pieces sympathetically to this collective artefact, with a feeling and love for the whole\u2019 (p. 93). 120 D. Harvey, Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 59. can be improved or worsened.1 Decisions about this belong to the community.2 \u2018A minority of private interests should not be allowed to dominate the town architecturally any more than it should socially,\u2019 Thomas Sharp insisted in relation to Cambridge in 1963.3 Relatedly, settlements need community buildings and common space. Ancient planners put all their talent into the building of the communal nucleus inns, churches, city halls,\u2019 says Victor Papanek. \u2018The rest of the settlement then followed by itself. Modern designers are forever concentrating on the rest of the city. But without an organic centre nothing can be held together.\u20194 If the contemporary equivalent of inns are McDonald\u2019s fast food shops then we are in real trouble, and there are few buildings, in the postmodern world, which genuinely speak for all. Is there a contemporary equivalent to the medieval cathedral, a building of comparable symbolic significance?5 Amongst public buildings Pevsner offers national monuments, government buildings, theatres, libraries, museums, hospitals, prisons, hotels, warehouses, railway stations, market halls, shops and factories. Ironically the only one of this list which elicits real public affection, at least in Europe, is the one Ruskin most vehemently denied could ever be a source of beauty the railway station.6 Even they have today been turned into emporia. If Harries is right, and the church or cathedral can no longer represent transcendent purpose for us, then at the moment, he feels, there is nothing we can do but wait, for \u2018values... cannot be made or invented. They must be discovered.\u20197 On the other hand, church is paradigmatic for all human community in the way that it lives in the present out of the past. Symbols change their values, of course, but they do not necessarily die. Pevsner\u2019s list makes clear how little there is by way of alternative signals of transcendence. Harries, like Lefebvre, suggests we should look to spaces for leisure, perhaps a landscape park, but as Harvey has noted with regard to Tompkins Park, these too have their problems.128 We have to ask what these common buildings, which often sum up the image of a place, 1 Recent examples of improvement in Britain are in Birmingham, carved up by roads in the nineteen sixties, increasingly restored to the pedestrian in the nineties, landscaped with fine urban sculpture; and Dundee, whose medieval heart was bulldozed in the sixties, and replaced by the worst kind of utilitarian building which has now mercifully been replaced with buildings of distinctly better quality. Most cities negotiate this kind of struggle year by year. 2 Cited in Kostoff, City p. 282. 3 Failure to heed this advice has done much to damage the skyline of London. 4 Green Imperative, p. 106. 5 Harries, Function, p. 107. 5 126 N. Pevsner, History of Building Types (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976). Ruskin cited 6 in Harries, Function, p. 31. 7 127 Harries, Function, p. 212. I2^ Ibid., p.367. actually stand for and say. The great Gothic cathedrals remain life giving because they grew out of passionately life affirming attitudes, faith in the givenness and goodness of all things, and in the beauty of the world.1 The image of the city raises the question of what its corporate project is, what it is for. Harries\u2019 suggestion leaves leisure as our common project, as do sports stadia and other prominent community buildings. Unfortunately the most prominent buildings in the contemporary city proclaim clearly enough what they are for. Henry James lamented the way in which Trinity Church in New York had been humbled and obscured by office towers, and we can say the same for St Paul\u2019s in London.2 We do not want the city to speak to us of religious values, necessarily, but we do not need the brazen triumph of Mammon either. Lastly there is the question of what a city does with its poor. Almost every human settlement above the hunter gatherer level has its rich and poor, but not every settlement condemns the poor to squalid or inhuman living conditions. How can that be beautiful which fails to respect the image of God, that image through which we understand the corporate personality of the city? To these five elements we need to add a word about traffic. Reversing the Athens charter, many cities in the West have been opting over the past twenty years for pedestrianisation, as the experience of thirty years of increasing car use proved to be increasingly devastating for the use and enjoyment of cities. Mumford reserves some of his most mordant prose for the tyranny of the motor car, the superstitious ritual of the worship of speed and empty space, but Wolterstorff explicitly addresses what the car does to the city aesthetic. Car passengers, he says, cannot get a sense of the aesthetic of the city. What must be added is that since we have insisted that the automobile be allowed to get within roughly 400 feet of every spot in the city, the car has been positively destructive of the city\u2019s aesthetic quality. We have had to... compromise both the unity and the variety, as well of course as the intensity, of the city\u2019s spaces. In addition, the pedestrian who might wish, against the grain, to savour the city on foot, is surrounded with ribbons of noise and mortal danger.'31 Only taming the car, he says, will once again allow the city to become a thing of joy, \u2018making of God\u2019s assurance to us that we will one day dwell in a new city a beckoning invitation rather than a repulsive horror\u2019.'32 1 Indian temples, still after fifty years of Independence difficult for Dalits to enter, are more questionable, though the exuberance of their vision of life is undeniable. As a commentary on the gospel the Vatican is more questionable still. 2 Kostoff, City, p. 282. 131 Wolterstorff, ArtinAction, p. 183. 132 Ibid. Art is as natural to human beings as is community. As Wolterstorff rightly insists, it has no one definition or purpose. It may represent a response of joy, ecstasy or despair in relation to the natural world; it may be an attempt at sympathetic magic; it may be an attempt to create aesthetic delight; it may be an attempt to intuit the truth of the world, and as such represent a prophetic critique of the society in which we live. The built environment, for the most part, does not operate on the level of high art, though there are obvious monumental exceptions. But because humans are form giving creatures what they make, the shelter they create for themselves, the design of their settlements, always partakes of art, and this may be good or bad. There is an artistic correlate to \u2018sin\u2019 and it is all around us, in our tedious estates, our boring shopping centres, in our tower blocks. Likewise there is an expression of grace in the form of the built environment, wherever forms give pleasure, raise the spirit or proclaim the world home, in suburban gardens, in city streets and parks, in the alleys and narrow lanes of villages. In the creation of such form the work of redemption is forwarded. And for that reason the cultivation of discernment, of the ability to see and to struggle for what is soul nurturing rather than life denying, is one of the key tasks of both theology and Church. God, nature and the built environment The earth lies polluted under its inhabitants; for they have transgressed laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse devours the earth... (Isaiah 24.5 6) A theology of the built environment, I argued in the first chapter, must be a theology of liberation. There is a familiar and ancient division between theologies centred more on creation and those centred more on salvation. Liberation theology belongs more to the latter, we are told: Exodus not Genesis is its paradigm text. This, however, cannot be the case in the present world situation. Writing in 1980 E. P. Thompson characterised the Western mind set as \u2018exterminism\u2019, referring not to nuclear weapons but to the threat posed by the sheer material success of our culture, and arguing that the material volume of the modern economy is incompatible with ecological stability.1 If that is the case, then the environmental movement, which is fundamentally a challenge to the internal logic of capitalism, must be the first, second and third imperative of a global liberation theology.2 THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS There is by now a very substantial literature on the environmental crisis, and I shall not repeat all the arguments and evidence here. The crisis rests on the conjunction of a burgeoning world population (which has grown from 1.6 billion to more than 6 billion since 1900, and nearly doubled since 1961) and the fact that per capita energy and material consumption 1 E. P. Thompson, Writing by Candlelight (London: Verso, 1980). 2 That liberation theology is not bound to the Exodus motif, but has a vital concern for the environment, is recognised by, amongst others, Leonardo Boff (.Ecology and Liberation: A New Paradigm (Maryknoll: Orbis, 1995)), and Mary Grey in many of her publications. have soared faster in the past forty years than human population. The result is that \u2018[a]n irresistible economy seems to be on a collision course with an immoveable ecosphere\u2019.3 The crisis has three major dimensions. There are macro problems of global warming and the growth in the hole in the ozone layer; the question of whether resources can keep up with population, especially as regards the availability of water and grain; and problems of environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity.4 More than two thousand leading scientists issued a joint declaration in 1996 in which they warned that \u2018many of our current practices put at risk the future that we wish for human society and the plant and the animal kingdoms, and may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know\u2019.5 What all this amounts to is that, as Robert Samuels puts it, God may not play dice with the universe, but humans do. In his view: \u2018In the geological time frame, humanity could be in the last split second of its existence. Within the lifetime of the generation born today the planet could either be terminally ill, or on a path to sustainable recovery.\u20196 This kind of language is obviously apocalyptic, as is much discussion of the nuclear threat and the poverty of the Third World, but this does not mean that we do not have to take it seriously. The impact of much contemporary secular apocalyptic, David Harvey feels, is only \u2018a general alarmism and sense of catastrophe\u2019 from which nothing constructive follows.7 Jewish and Christian apocalyptic, on the other hand, intends not to evoke horror in the face of the end, but to encourage endurance in resistance to the powers of the world.8 It is not melancholy interpretation but an urgent call to change. This applies to the built environment as to other areas because it is a significant part, perhaps even the key part, of the environmental problem. When it comes to global warming, for example, Allan Rodger describes the built environment as \u2018the principal villain\u2019 in the story.9 In Britain the use of buildings accounts 3 M. Wackernagel and W. Rees, Our Ecological Footprint (Gabriola Island: New Society, 1996), p. 13. Although fertility rates show a slight fall off, the base population rate is so large that very extensive increases are inevitable. 4 Readers not familiar with these details may consult my Fair Shares: Ethics and the Global Economy (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1999) and the bibliography there. 5 Union of Concerned Scientists, World Scientists\u2019 Warning to Humanity (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, :996) 6 R. Samuels in R. Samuels andD. Prasad (eds.), Global Warming and the Built Environment (London'. Spon, 1996), p. 19. 7 D. Harvey, Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. 216 17. 8 J. Moltmann, 7 %\u00a3 Coming of God (London: SCM, 1996), p. 217. 9 A. Rodger, \u2018Sustainable development, energy policy issues and greenhouse\u2019, in Samuels and Prasad (eds.), Global Warmings p. 96. for 46 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions and when construction is added it is more than 50 per cent. Energy is consumed in vast quantities at every stage of the process \u2014 in the production of bricks, cement, steel, aluminium, glass, plaster; in their transport and assembly, and then heating, cooling and lighting buildings once they are up. The construction industry uses an estimated 3 billion tonnes of raw materials per year 40 per cent of the total flow into the global economy. Really to understand the part played by the built environment in the environmental crisis, however, we have to ask what the implications are of the fact that half of humankind now live in cities. \u2018As primary consumers cities use up fossil fuels hundreds of thousands of times faster than they can accumulate in the earth.\u201910 The concept of the ecological footprint, developed by William Rees, helps us to chart the impact urbanisation makes. The ecological footprint is the amount of land required to feed a city or region, supply it with timber products and absorb its carbon dioxide emissions. It has been calculated that the ecological footprint of London, with 11 million inhabitants, is 50 million acres, 125 times greater than its actual surface area of 400,000 acres.11 The OECD nations consume half the world\u2019s commercial energy and 40 per cent of this comes from heating, lighting and providing air conditioning for homes and offices.12 Some of this demand is generated by building which is insensitive to local conditions. Notoriously, Le Corbusier wanted \u2018one single building for all nations and climates\u2019. Ignoring local climates means installing huge heating and air conditioning systems in offices, factories, homes and hotels around the world.13 The Sears tower in Chicago uses more energy in 24 hours than an average American city of 150,000 or an Indian city of more than 1 million.14 New York City uses as much electrical energy as the whole continent of Africa. The richest cities contribute most to world wide environmental degradation because of their dependency on an unsustainable level of resource use.15 When air conditioning comes into play huge quantities of CFCs are released as well. On these grounds Patrick Troy argues that modern cities are inherently 10 H. Girardet, The Gaia Atlas of Cities (London: Gaia, rev. edn 1996), p. 106. 12 M. Smith, J. Whiteleg and N. Williams, Greening the Built Environment (London: Earthscan, 1998), p. 6. 13 Ibid., p. 42. 14 G. Haughton and C. Hunter, Sustainable Cities (London: Regional Studies Association, 1994), p. 14. 15 M. Jenks, E. Burton and K. Williams (eds.), The Compact City: A Sustainable Urban Form? (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 4. ecologically unsustainable because they need to import food, energy and raw materials, produce more waste than they can cope with within their boundaries, and radically change the ecology of their sites. In his view, the larger the concentration of population the less sustainable it is, even if the city\u2019s hinterland is included in the equation.'6 For the architect Richard Rogers \u2018the world\u2019s environmental crisis is being driven by our cities... the scale, and the rate of increase, of our consumption of resources, and the pollution it inflicts, is catastrophic\u2019.'7 Others point out that cities place a huge burden on the countryside, consuming much fertile agricultural land (at the rate of 2 per cent a decade in Western Europe). The rate of resources consumption per capita increases with city size, especially water, as more is needed for services. In general terms, \u2018the larger the city, the more dependent the city becomes on external ecosystems\u2019, both because consumption rises and because the internal capacity for food and energy is reduced.'8 Cities always had hinterlands, but as we saw in chapter 6 these are now global. Given the amount of food ferried in by air the footprint of any town with a large supermarket expands gigantically. Urban areas are also a centre for air and noise pollution. It is estimated that air pollution in cities may be responsible for as many as a quarter of all deaths of children under five world wide.'9 Much of this pollution is caused by the use of motor vehicles whose use continues to increase throughout the world at the expense of public transport. In 1987 it was estimated that transport was responsible for 7 0 per cent of pollution in Moscow, 48 per cent in Warsaw, and 80 per cent in Mexico City. In Britain road transport accounts for 18 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions, 85 per cent of carbon monoxide emissions and 45 per cent of nitrous oxides, most of which are deposited outside the city.20 A single tank of petrol produces between 120 and 180kg of carbon dioxide and motor vehicle traffic is responsible for about 15 per cent of the world\u2019s carbon dioxide output. According to the European Commission\u2019s Task Force on the Environment transport is the most important single source of environmental damage but hauliers only pay one eighth of the social and environmental costs.21 John Adams talks of \u2018Carmageddon\u2019, by which he means that the human scale of settlements is everywhere threatened by the growth of car dependence, and public transport is on the retreat, following a move which happened 1 2 3 4 1 P. Troy, \u2018Environmental Stress and Urban Policy\u2019 in ibid., p. 200. 2 R. Rogers, \u2018Learning to live with the city\u2019, The Independent, 13 February 1995. 3 Haughton and Hunter, Sustainable Cities, p. 70. 19 Ibid., p. 135. 4 20 Ibid., pp. 97, 162. 21 Girardet, Gaia Atlas, p. 104. in the United States in the second and third decades of the twentieth century.1 In Britain both out of town shopping centres and large hospitals developed in the last twenty years have seen a shift away from locations accessible by bus or on foot towards car based locations.2 Suburban, urban fringe and rural developments are car and lorry dependent, and are therefore antithetical to energy efficiency. Fifty years ago in Britain passenger mileage by bus was twice that of the car; now mileage by car is fourteen times that of the bus.3 The situation is better in some European countries, whilst public transport is still the norm in large parts of Asia. Even here, however, the burgeoning middle class aspire to car ownership, and the seductiveness of the freedom it gives to go anywhere when one wants, without consulting timetables, queuing, waiting for delayed trains or buses, and sharing sometimes very crowded or uncomfortable coaches cannot be underestimated. In the North, meanwhile, we have constructed a society dependent on the long distance transport of food. Supermarkets are full of fruit, flowers and vegetables flown in from Latin America, Asia and Africa, all of which contribute to the ecological footprint of the communities who buy them. In a famous piece of research Stephanie Boge in 1993 established that one pot of strawberry yoghurt involved 8,000 km of transportation, and the case of more exotic foods would be far greater, much of it involving air travel which poses a serious threat to the ozone layer.4 In Britain, for example, half of all butter produced is exported, whilst half of all butter used is imported mainly from New Zealand. Quite apart from transport and commuting, travel has become an end in itself. World tourism is a major industry, as ever more distant and exotic places have to be found to stimulate jaded appetites, and air travel is the preferential option for business, with ongoing implications for the construction of new airports and continued damage to the ozone layer. The discussion about new airports, constantly in the news, rarely touches the fundamental issue, which is that US style aviation use cannot be generalised without serious damage to the environment. It is aviation, in particular, which \u2018symbolizes the global rush towards non sustainability cloaked in a rhetoric of green concerns\u2019.5 1 In A. Barnett andR. Scruton (eds.), Town and Country (London: Jonathan Gape, 1998), pp. 217 32. 2 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greening,, p. 95. 3 M. Hillman,\u2018In Favour of the Compact City\u2019, in Jenks, Burton and Williams (eds.), Compact City, p 36 4 E. von Weizs\u00e4cker, A. Lovins and L. Lovins, Factor Four (London: Earthscan, 1997), p. 117. 5 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greening,, p. 28. Another form of damage to the environment from the priority we give to transport is that it involves very high land take. Cars need parking space, in Britain 24 square metres per car. Ten thousand parking spaces, as provided at the Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, England, use 3 6 hectares of land and could provide 648 housing units. Local authorities in England alone account for some 24 square kilometres of parking space.27 As more and more heavy goods traffic is put on the roads, so the implications for land take expand. Roads designed to take 38 tonne, 15 metre long lorries need more space for their junctions and curves than do roads designed for cars or smaller lorries... Increases in lorry weight require more substantial structures and road pavements which in their turn demand more of the raw materials of construction... a lorry requires 0.007 square metres of space per tonne kilometre in comparison to rail which needs 0.0025 square metres. The lorry, therefore, requires almost three times as much space to do the same work as the train.28 The rush to roads has received slight checks in Britain, in the form of pedestrianisation, whilst the ecocidal and megalomaniac road building plans of the eighties have been shelved (though not without the destruction of Twyford Down and large areas of Berkshire). Serious steps in terms of fuel tax, however, meet with strong resistance. The authors of Greening the Built Environment comment that there is currently little sign of intelligent land use planning in developed countries with the intention of returning space to people and to social interaction rather than vehicles.29 Finally, the World Health Organisation estimates that about 250,000 people die every year on the world\u2019s roads, more than half of these fatalities being pedestrians and cyclists. Fifty thousand Americans die every year in road accidents, equal to the total number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.30 Over against all these grim negatives can be set the pleasures of travel, and of exploring new places and different situations; the ease with which one can visit friends and family compared with the situation only a generation ago; and the privilege of a fresh and varied diet all year round, which all previous generations could only have dreamed of. But again we have to ask who it is, what proportion of the current world population, that enjoys these things, and at what cost to future generations. All of these goods pose major questions of inter and intra generational equity. QUESTIONING THE CRISIS In a strongly argued challenge to the assumptions of the kind of thought I have just been outlining David Harvey (in 1996) called \u2018the very idea that the planet is somehow vulnerable to human action or that we can actually destroy the earth\u2019 a repetition in negative form of the hubristic claims of those who aspire to planetary domination. Against this it is crucial to understand that it is materially impossible for us to destroy the planet earth, that the worst we can do is to engage in material transformations of our environment so as to make life less rather than more comfortable for our own species being, while recognizing that what we do also does have ramifications... for other living species.1 In his most recent book he is less dismissive of ecological apocalyptic.2 Harvey concedes that a capitalist political economy involves a triumphal ist approach to nature, but he challenges the idea that we have no choice but to live within the limits of the second law of thermodynamics and the inherent sustaining power of ecosystems. The difficulty here is that \u2018neither principle is helpful at all in explaining the shifting history of human social organization, or even the genesis of life itself\u2019.3 He sees little sense in speaking of natural resources as limited for what exists \u2018in nature\u2019 is in a constant state of transformation. Human beings are not outside of nature but part of it.4 Scarcity is socially produced and \u2018limits\u2019 are a social relation within nature rather than some externally imposed necessity.5 He suspects that all debate about eco scarcity, natural limits, overpopulation and sustainability is a debate about the preservation of a particular social order rather than a debate about the preservation ofnatur eper se, and that control over the resources of others is the real agenda.6\u00ae Apocalyptic rhetoric may lead, not to cooperative and democratic action, but to authoritarian solutions and \u2018lifeboat ethics\u2019 in which the powerful throw the weak overboard.37 1 D. Harvey, Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 194. 2 Harvey, Spaces of Hope, p. 220. 3 Harvey, Justice, p. 140. 3 34 Mary Grey underlines this point, pointing out that the word \u2018environment\u2019 \u2018does not adequately describe that core of identity, dependence and connection with physical, biotic reality\u2019. \u2018The Shape of the Human Home\u2014A Response to Tim Gorrin gt\\Political Theology 3 (November 2000), 4 p. 96. Can we abandon the term when we speak of building, however? 5 Harvey, Justice, p. 147. The idea that scarcity is nothing but a problem of distribution (G. Ward, Cities of God (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 246) is extraordinary One would have thought that Chernobyl was a sufficient warning of the ease with which it could once again become a major problem, to say nothing of developing resistance to the \u2018all purpose\u2019 and \u2018miracle\u2019 weedkiller \u2018Roundup\u2019. 6 Of course, Harvey has a point. Green rhetoric has certainly been coopted by those, like the major Transnational Corporations (TNCs), whose principal interest is carving up the world amongst themselves. Or alternatively, deep ecologists can champion the rights of the wilderness over those of local communities. On the other hand to dismiss the possibility of doing irreversible harm to the planet seems far too cavalier. The evidence for global warming is inescapable, as is the determination of the United States to date to do nothing about it. Chaos theory warns us that completely unexpected outcomes are possible. CFCs, vital to refrigeration, air conditioning and the production of foam blown furniture, are a good illustration. Hailed in the 1930s as a breakthrough they turned out, fifty years later, to be one of the main causes of damage to the ozone layer. Systems do not necessarily return to their previous state once stressed and exhaustion can set in. Many climate scientists now believe that the possibility of global warming simply running away is real. Of course scarcity can be socially produced, as Amartya Sen famously showed, but, as in the case of water shortages, there may be natural limits to face as well. For many years now the Worldwatch team have been arguing precisely this in relation to grain production. At the very least, then, we have to recognise that \u2018[w]e face a series of environmental bottlenecks in the twenty first century which have already largely been constructed by past human actions. It is important to take evasive action now to prevent them closing to form solid walls.\u20191 Part of the reason for Harvey\u2019s earlier dismissal of apocalyptic thinking seems to rest in a confusion over the term \u2018nature\u2019. Barry Commoner formulated the laws of ecology as everything is connected to everything else; everything must go somewhere nature knows best there is no such thing as a free lunch.2 \u2018Nature\u2019, in the third proposition, is obviously shorthand for the whole evolutionary process in which, as we know, there is a great deal of wan ton destruction, but in which a complex ecological balance is nevertheless maintained. As Schumacher puts it, \u2018Nature always... knows when to stop. Greater even than the mystery of natural growth is the mystery of the natural cessation of growth... the system of nature, of which man is part, tends to be self balancing, self adjusting, self cleansing.\u201940 \u2018Nature\u2019 1 Ibid., p. 221. 2 B. Commoner The Closing Circle (New York: Knopf, 1971), pp. 33 48. 2 40 E. F. Schumacher, Small is Beautiful (London: Sphere, 1974), p 122. may be red in tooth and claw but it does not destroy itself, although a hail of meteorites could possibly do this by knocking the earth off course, and this might count as a \u2018natural\u2019 process. Harvey agrees with the ecologists that human beings are not external to eco systems but part of them. What has to be added to this is that human rationality makes us not just part of nature in this sense but also transcendent to it. The fact that as a species we are part of nature does not mean that everything we do is \u2018natural\u2019. On the contrary there are \u2018cruel and unnatural\u2019 punishments, ways of using the imagination which are fiendish. Our \u2018rationality\u2019 gives us both the capacity to enhance our environment, to till and nurture it, as the author of Genesis 2 puts it, but also to destroy it. Harvey insists that we should not think of great cities as \u2018unnatural\u2019. The answer is not necessarily. Cities can live sympathetically with their environment, as Chinese cities still do. They can also destroy them. All over the ancient Near East civilisations eliminated themselves by overcropping and overgrazing, and turning their hinterlands into desert. Yes, human beings are part of \u2018nature\u2019 and their settlements extend and modify existing eco systems. But, as Jeffrey Cook puts it, \u2018Of all the recognized ecological systems it is human urbanism which seems most destructive of its host.\u20191' Urban living seems conducive to \u2018unnatural behaviour\u2019 precisely because, where all our needs are met from supermarket shelves, we forget that nature works in closed loops. \u2018Big city life breaks natural material cycles and provides little sense of our intimate connection with nature.\u201942 It fosters a hubristic attitude to the natural world which is in the literal sense potentially lethal. Again, there are positives to set over against the negatives. As Anthony O\u2019Hear puts it: \u2018For every oil slick there are a thousand examples of landscape gardening, for every polluted river many acres of reclaimed marshland, for every devastated forest many carefully tended plantations, all cases where human intervention has enhanced nature to great effect.\u201943 This is true, but the rain forest still burns, the ice caps are melting, CFCs still released will take more decades to do their work, and the impact of carbon dioxide emissions goes on mounting and at present levels will take at least a century to dissipate. No amount of careful landscape gardening makes up for this. 1 1 J.

There are, of course, scientists who dispute these claims, but in many cases they work for lobby groups for international capital, which must make their results suspect.1 The problem is that, as the veteran environmental economist E. J. Mishan put it, someone who throws themselves off a skyscraper is conscious until very near the ground, but by then it is too late to change their mind. We simply do not have enough information to allow us to be cavalier in the face of the environmental problems which already present themselves. Far better to adopt the precautionary principle. This functions to stimulate collective action to safeguard critical life support processes, to try and see that the burden of environmental responsibility is shared, and to promote global citizenship.2 No one has put this better than Ruskin, writing more than a century ago, when the scale of environmental damage was scarcely guessed at: God has lent us the earth for our life. It is a great entail. It belongs as much to those who follow us as it does to us, and we have no right by anything we do, or neglect to do, to involve them in unnecessary penalties, or deprive them of the benefit we have it in our power to bequeath.3\u201c Harvey feels that to declare a state of eco scarcity is in effect to say that \u2018we do not have the will, wit or capacity to change our state of knowledge, our social goals, cultural modes, and technological mixes, or our form of economy, and that we are powerless to modify either our material practices or \u201cnature\u201d according to human requirements\u2019.4 But that is precisely the problem, for there is very little evidence that we have the will to change the destructive aspects of our culture, even if we have the wit and the capacity. As Rudolf Bahro put it: \u2018We still lack the decisive precondition for salvation, the will to turn things round.\u20195 We need to go on now to ask why that is the case and what we can do, if anything, to change it. THE CAUSES OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS In a famous article written in 1967 Lynn White Jnr, a Christian himself, traced the deep roots of the environmental crisis to the Christian attitude to nature. \u2018What people do about their ecology\u2019, he noted, \u2018depends 1 See A. Rowell, Green Backlash (London: Routledge, 1996), pp. i4,off. for these scientists, and their connection with right wing groups and fossil fuel industries. 2 Haughton and Hunter, Sustainable Cities, p. 220. 3 Cited by O\u2019Hear, \u2018The Myth of Nature\u2019, p. 79. 47 Harvey, Justice, p. 147. 4 4 8 R. Bahro, Avoiding Social and Ecological Disaster: The Politics of World Transformation (Bath: Gateway, 5 1994), p. 6. on what they think about themselves in relation to things around them. Human ecology is deeply conditioned by beliefs about our nature and destiny that is, by religion.\u2019 He believed this to be as true in 1967, in the so called \u2018post Christian West\u2019, as it had been in the middle ages. What was it about Christianity, then, which allowed the series of revolutions which have brought on the environmental crisis to happen? In brief, it was the victory over paganism. In destroying pagan animism Christianity made it possible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of natural objects. He suggested a return to the alternative view of St Francis who tried to \u2018substitute the idea of the equality of all creatures, including man, for the idea of man\u2019s limitless rule of creation\u2019.1 If we extend this argument to include the built environment, we can see that it would tend to favour non urban futures over urban ones. Carolyn Merchant took this argument further, seeing the emergence of a new synthesis in the sixteenth century between rising capitalism, machine power and Protestantism. The emphasis on God\u2019s will and active power associated with the Reformation tended to legitimate human power and activity in worldly affairs and fostered an interest in technological improvement, empirical observation of God\u2019s works in creation, and experimentation to extract and use nature\u2019s secrets for human benefit... The domination of nature depends equally on man as operator deriving from an emphasis on power and on man as manager deriving from the stress on order and rationality as criteria for progress and development.2 Of course this analysis overlooks the extent to which Reformed theology was a theology of grace, and therefore opposed precisely to any \u2018legitimation of human power\u2019. Tracing intellectual and cultural causality is always tricky, as the century long debate on Weber\u2019s thesis shows, and it is an open question whether White and Merchant are right, or whether, rather, Christian theology followed the direction of developing technology and capitalism. Certainly by the later decades of the eighteenth century \u2018divine nature\u2019 was being imaged as a neglected \u2018fair\u2019, abandoned for the cities. This is how Cowper saw it: Nature, enchanting Nature, in whose form And lineaments divine I trace a hand That errs not, and find raptures still renew\u2019d, Is free to all men universal prize. 1 \u2018The historical roots of our ecological crisis\u2019, Science l 55/3767 (March 1967), pp. 1203 7. Kjellberg points out the irony that this article appeared only one year after The Secular City. S. Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheology (Utrecht: International Books, 2000), p. 59. 2 5 \u00b0 G. Merchant, The Death of Nature (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1980), p. 234. Strange that so fair a creature should yet want Admirers, and be destined to divide With meaner objects e\u2019en the few she finds! Stripp\u2019d of her ornaments, her leaves, her flowers, She loses all her influence. Cities then Attract us, and neglected Nature pines, Abandon\u2019d as unworthy of our love.1 Cowper already puts cities at the heart of his analysis of what is going wrong. By 1783, when this was written, the industrial revolution was well under way and Cowper, like Wordsworth and Coleridge a few years later, is responding to it, and to the booming cities it spawned. Harvey points out that the thesis of mastery over nature does not necessarily entail destructiveness, but can just as easily lead to loving, caring and nurturing practices. True enough, but this is not what has actually happened, and there is only too much evidence for the practices of domination which Merchant details. From the mid eighteenth century onwards some have proposed that the remedy for such dominating practices is a new religion of nature. No less a historian than Simon Schama argues that \u2018[t]he cultural habits of humanity have always made room for the sacredness of nature\u2019. To take the ills of the environment seriously \u2018does not... require that we trade in our cultural legacy or its posterity. It asks that we simply see it for what it has truly been: not the repudiation, but the veneration of nature.\u20192 What this would amount to in a world where nature has become culture, and nature is reconstructed as an ideal cultural form, is another matter.3 The destructive effects of religion have been noted at a number of points in this book already, and Kate Soper properly extends such questioning to the idea of religion coming to the aid of threatened nature. The idea of nature as gift possibly protected nature by encouraging a fear of retribution, she argues, but very divergent views on whether Scripture encourages care, or abuse, of nature are possible and exegesis of the Genesis domination text \u2018tends to be conducted in the light of the... rationalizations to which theology can always be made to lend itself\u2019.4 She takes an Enlightenment view of the matter, insisting that nature cannot be protected by pretending to forms of belief \u2018exploded by the march of science and technology\u2019. It is simply a question of taking 1 W. Cowper, The Garden (1783 4), Cowper\u2019s Poetical Works (Edinburgh: Gall &amp; Inglis, 1853), p. 148. 2 S. Schama, Landscape and Memory (London: Fontana, 1996), p. 18. 3 M. Castells, The Rise of the Network Society (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 477. 4 K. Soper, What is Nature? (Oxford: Blackwell, 1995), pp 274, 281. the rough with the smooth. We have to recognise that damage to the environment is part and parcel of the move which liberated human beings from fear and superstition.1 It is fair to criticise religion, but Soper\u2019s faith in Enlightenment is surely naive. For the Enlightenment brought with it, as Mumford put it, \u2018a deep contempt for organic processes that involve maintaining the complex partnership of all organic forms, in an environment favourable to life in all its manifestations\u2019.2 And if we are inescapably part inheritors of the Enlightenment tradition we are equally inescapably inheritors of the religious tradition as well. The question, then, is what we make of, and do with, both. \u2018Enlightenment\u2019 is bound up with the growth of a world capitalist economy, the move to the city, and the advent of mega cities. It is to this, more plausibly, that we have to look for the causes of the environmental crisis. For at the heart of the capitalist process is a compulsion for growth. Mumford compared Western civilisation to a gigantic motor car moving along a one way road at an ever accelerating speed. Unfortunately as now constructed the car lacks both steering wheel and brakes, and the only form of control the driver exercises consists in making the car go faster, though in his fascination with the machine itself and his commitment to achieving the highest speed possible, he has quite forgotten the purpose of the journey. This state of helpless submission to the economic and technological mechanisms modern man has created is curiously disguised as progress, freedom, and the mastery of man over nature. As a result, every permission has become a morbid compulsion. Modern man has mastered every creature above the level of the viruses and bacteria except himself.57 Nowhere is this critique more true than in the commitment of conventional economics to growth which, in becoming an end in itself, completely obscures what Mumford calls \u2018the purpose of the journey\u2019. For all Western thinkers up to the eighteenth century economics was a sub discipline of ethics. Economics followed from understandings of meaning and purpose. Part of what Karl Polanyi called the \u2018great transformation\u2019 was that this order was inverted: increasingly it came to be the economy, and \u2018growth\u2019, which gave value to human life. The reasons for this are discussed in a huge literature. The efficiencies gained by the division of labour become a treadmill, as increased production demands larger markets in an endless cycle. Machines increase production, but have to 1 Ibid., 275. 56 L. Mumford, The City in History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p. 600. 2 57 Ibid., p. 636. turn out more and sell more in order to pay for themselves. Innovations drive old products from the held and call forth yet more innovations. The system of interest is self perpetuating, as my business has to grow to pay back the interest on the money I have borrowed, which requires new loans, and so on. At the most fundamental level capitalism\u2019s need to grow to live requires that we all become consumers. As Mumford put it: \u2018The machine came into our civilization, not to save man from the servitude to ignoble forms of work, but to make more widely possible the servitude to ignoble standards of consumption that had grown up among the military aristocracies.\u201958 This is not only bad news for the environment, but extremely bad news for human self understanding. For Aristotle, and for most philosophers and theologians up until the nineteenth century, the good life, and being a whole human being, essentially involved the acceptance of limits. St Paul\u2019s \u2018Let your moderation be known to all\u2019 was good Aristotelian advice. The doctrine of limits is no obscure piece of ancient scholasticism. On the contrary, any skill requires recognition of limits, and nothing worthwhile is achieved without them. \u2018Any activity which fails to recognise a self limiting principle is of the devil,\u2019 as Schumacher put it.59 Limits are vital because huge numbers mean huge impacts. As Daly and Cobb note, \u2018If \u201cneeds\u201d include an automobile for each of a billion Chinese, then sustainable development is impossible. The whole issue of sufficiency can no longer be avoided.\u201960 The issue is ethical and political: who decides who can enjoy what, and at what cost? Addressing inequalities in global consumption is essential if ecological damage is to be contained. Thus Wackernagel and Rees have argued that \u2018if everyone on Earth lived like the average Canadian or American, we would need at least three such planets to live sustainably\u2019.61 Huge numbers inevitably also put pressure on the basic resources of water and food which, in the view of the Worldwatch team, are under threat. Already in 1992, in a review of the world\u2019s water problems Sandra Postel noted that \u2018 [i]n many parts of the world, water use is nearing the limits of natural systems\u2019 and in some areas they have been surpassed.62 The problem with the call for limits is that the quest for more constitutes the spiritual centre of the capitalist world. A meeting of economists in 1987 rejected the very idea of limits which could not be taken care of by capital.1 As David Korten points out this follows because to accept the reality of physical limits is to accept the need to limit greed and acquisition in favour of economic justice and sufficiency.2 In order to survive, therefore, capitalism is necessarily, and not just contingently, committed to inculcating in us the reign of perverse and inordinate desire. The problem behind the environmental crisis, in other words and here I agree with Lynn White is spiritual, in the broadest sense. This growth compulsion is linked to what Mumford called the \u2018Megamachine\u2019, the organisation of power which began in the ancient civilisations of Babylon, Assyria and Egypt, which from the start aimed at the exploitation and manipulation of the bulk of the citizenry.3 Global capital, with its voracious demand for \u2018more\u2019, is the heart of the contemporary megamachine. It controls not by the whip and the truncheon but by the allurements of the commodity. Since cities and capital go together, this \u2018more\u2019 translates itself into increasing cities as well. Human beings have always been able to destroy their environment, as the ancient Mesopotamian cities, and Easter Island, show. What is new is the scale of the impact, and the level of destruction we can cause. And it is not decisively big business or the military industrial complex which is responsible for this. It is ultimately with the Mercedes and washing machine detergents that we do the damage, rather than with bombs, nuclear power stations and dioxins... A private dwelling full of comforts necessarily confirms the whole worldwide infrastructure including the need for armaments, because in face of monstrous differences in standards it is a threatened luxury.4 Thus there is no simple battle between \u2018good guys and bad guys\u2019 because the power of the Megamachine exists \u2018within, in the nodal points of research and production, management and business, education and politics, dependent on the psychological power relations in society\u2019.\u00ae5 Indeed, it exists within each consuming self. What Mumford and Bahro are drawing attention to here is what Christianity has spoken of as \u2018original sin\u2019, the human tendency to destroy self, other and creation through idolatry, making created things ultimate.6 1 15 May 1987; cited in Daly and Cobb, Common Good, p. 194. 2 D. Korten, When Corporations Rule the World (West Hartford, Conn.: Kumarian, 1995), p. 81. 3 L.

Urban EcdTheology, p. 141. Much of the dis ease of twentieth century art was due not just to the loss of a previously established home, but to an overt nihilism, an overt absence of meaning, which expressed itself in the death camps and the nuclear arms race. This nihilism now finds expression in consumerism. \u2018It should not be a surprise\u2019, write the authors of Greening the Built Environment, \u2018that a materialistic society which takes a short term view should create and live in a built environment that is being extended and continually recreated at the expense of the earth\u2019s capital resources.\u20191 Las Vegas, built in a desert, for the purposes of\u2018pleasure\u2019, dependent on aquifer resources for its water, needing air conditioning to make life bearable, illustrates this perfectly but so do greenfield housing developments and out of town shopping centres. One cannot say, tout court, that it is \u2018capitalism\u2019 which produces these developments, but on the other hand it both makes them possible and promotes them. The imperatives of capital short term profit, market forces and the cultivation of needs are the driving forces behind them. These forces are difficult to counter because they have the weight of the multi national corporations, the banks and finance institutes, but even more our own pathetically desiring selves behind them, and because the momentum developed is already so strong. Because that is the case, breaking the cycle of consumption cannot begin simply with a challenge to the institutions. Neither can it be a matter solely of technological fixes, important as these are. It involves, rather, adopting a new understanding on human nature and destiny, and a new understanding of the importance of lifestyle options. In overcoming exterminism, Bahro recognised, \u2018No order can save us which simply limits the excesses of our greed. Only spiritual mastery of the greed itself can help us. It is perhaps only the Prophets and Buddhas, whether or not their answers were perfect, who have at least put the question radically enough.\u20192 Schumacher already recognised this in Small is Beautiful. \u2018The cultivation of needs\u2019, he wrote, \u2018is the antithesis of wisdom. It is also the antithesis of freedom and peace. Every increase of needs tends to increase one\u2019s dependence on outside forces over which one cannot have control, and therefore increases existential fear.\u20197' Schumacher himself turned to Buddhism for guidance. The question for Christians is whether there is anything the gospel can contribute to the problems which are posed us. 1 Smith, Whiteleg and Williams, Greening, p. 210. 2 7 \u00b0 Bahro, Avoidings p. 25. 7 1 Schumacher, Small is Beautiful, p. 23. LIBERATION THEOLOGY AND THE HOMELINESS OF THE WORLD The word \u2018liberation\u2019 in the phrase \u2018liberation theology\u2019 represents a gloss on an older theology of salvation. Human beings, the Church always said, needed to be saved from \u2018sin\u2019. Where for centuries this was understood individually and moralistically liberation theology understood it socially and politically, specifying the structures which constituted \u2018sin\u2019. It is these which Wink understands as the \u2018Powers\u2019, which are created, fallen, and need redemption. The \u2018power\u2019 which underlies the suicidal compulsion to growth is what E. P. Thompson meant by \u2018exterminism\u2019. The positive side of growth is the recognition of the need to provide the best possible standard of living for all the earth\u2019s people. It becomes a fallen Power when it becomes an end in itself, a compulsion. This negative spirituality is what causes the gap between rich and poor to increase all over the globe; what drives the poor increasingly into the shanty towns of the great cities. Above all it is our alienation from the planet, the slow choking of the atmosphere, the predatory approach to resources, which make clear how this form of sin is, in the most literal sense, life denying. It is the refusal to recognise limits which, at the very least, threatens the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of the world\u2019s poorest people through global warming, if it does not actually threaten the planet. If my analysis of the causes of the reckless commitment to growth at any cost is right then, in the contemporary world, savage capitalism is the concrete form of sin. The fundamental theological opposition to capitalism is the theology of grace, the \u2018for nothing\u2019 of creation and redemption. Those who see the point of gracious living are called, collectively, ec clesia, which is to say, those not captured by the plausibility structures of capitalism, those who oppose the anti spirituality of profit with the spirituality of thanksgiving, or as the early church said, \u2018the sacrifice of praise\u2019. Rather than considering all reality from the perspective of profit, they see it from God\u2019s point of view, as unconditionally gifted, therefore free, and to be shared and celebrated together. Ec clesians do not accept determinist views about there being no alternatives, but look for ways of subverting the cunning of exterminism (sometimes called the cunning of reason, or the invisible hand). According to the word of Jesus in Mark 10.43 ('It shall not be so amongst you\u2019) ec clesians are ec centrics: they have a different centre to others: not the megamachine but what Jesus calls \u2018the kingdom\u2019. Being other centred is not being other worldly in the sense of looking for salvation first and foremost beyond this world. On the contrary: where sin makes us strangers, grace calls the world home. Being other centred means challenging global capitalism\u2019s claim to be the narrative of the world, replacing it with a narrative of giftedness. Liberation theology seeks practical recognition for that giftedness, for the homeliness of the world. Faith in the God who creates and redeems us has to work for the world as human home, or, as Mary Grey has argued, for an environment conducive to human flourishing.1 To that assertion Christian critics will immediately respond with, \u2018FIere we have no lasting city.\u2019 But the \u2018kingdom\u2019 at the heart of Jesus\u2019 gospel cannot be construed as an other worldly agenda. It is about the shaping of the world and Jesus could not fulfil the law and the prophets otherwise. It is true that this world does not exhaust the meaning of\u2018the kingdom\u2019, but without the inclusion of this world the idea makes no sense. After the apostolic preaching Paul represents the first major commentary on Jesus\u2019 programme. He read the opposition between the kingdom and its opponents as an opposition between \u2018sin\u2019 and \u2018grace\u2019, but these were from the start specified quite concretely. In the terms of this book, \u2018sin\u2019 represents our alienation from the world, our reduction of it to nothing but a set of resources for the rich, whilst \u2018grace\u2019 calls the world home, recognises it as gift. A liberation theology of the built environment wants practical recognition for the homeliness of the world. If it concedes that the city is \u2018a central form of man\u2019s co existence with the rest of Creation\u2019 it does so only in recognition of the need for a city healed of its parasitism and voracious consumption.2 In a world of manifold alienations liberation theology will, therefore, be a theology of being \u2018at home\u2019. But there is a problem here manifested by the fact that twentieth century musicians, artists and poets have recorded the dis ease at not being at home in the world in a way which has no earlier parallel, as far as I can see, and which is bound up with the exponential speed of change since roughly 1800. In a famous image Raymond Williams talked of the \u2018escalator\u2019 of nostalgia, for which the truly homely world is always back over the last hill. Considering the claim that twentieth century changes in rural life meant that \u2018a whole culture 1 Flourishing, she points out, is an ecological metaphor, rooted in bodily life. \u2018 Flourishing pushes far beyond the mere fact of survival, to qualitative factors like relationships of mutuality, plentiful provision of nourishment, the giving and receiving of hospitality, just employment, selfesteem and esteem of the community... [It] can act as an ethical yardstick with more potential than the language of Human Rights, as critique against poor housing, for classroom conditions which in theory pass the basic norm, but in which children cannot flourish, hospitals where the quality of care does not respect the whole person in relation, and so on5 (Grey, \u2018Shape5, p. 102). The argument is developed more fully in The Outrageous Pursuit of Hope (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 2000). Raimond Gaita, on the other hand, believes that the concept lacks the conceptual resources to deal with the severely afflicted. A Common Humanity (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 19. 2 The phrase is from Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheology, p. 71. It neatly expresses Harvey\u2019s view of the city as well. that had preserved its continuity from earliest times had now received its quietus\u2019 Raymond Williams traced this sentiment back through to the middle ages, and indeed back to Saxon and Celtic times. Where, he asked, does the escalator of that particular sentiment stop?1 It is a fair question. The sense of being strangers and pilgrims is not new and seems in particular to have defined early Christian sensibility. At the same time the threnody of the rural past has a point, for all over the world, in 1900, harvests were in fact gathered by hand and fields ploughed by horse and oxen and that, and all the skills and knowledge which went with it, have in large part disappeared in a matter of decades. Twentieth century pastoral Cider with Rosie is a good illustration laments the passing not only of these skills but of the sense of being at home which belonged with them. At the end of the twentieth century the historic possibilities of humankind for settlement hamlet, village, town, city \u2014 nowhere remain unaltered. Even in Mongolia the small portable generator introduces colour television to the plains\u2019 family\u2019s yurt, as it does in the Indian and African village. The millennia humankind has spent in these settlements, however, profoundly shape our sense of the human home. Evolution is not destiny \u2014 our past does not imprison us. On the other hand, neither can we accept the hubristic Enlightenment idea that we can begin with a clean slate, and ignore the power of historical memory, allowing ourselves to be guided only by the \u2018light\u2019, or rather the cunning of reason. The problem with this reason is that it is too clever by half and, as Schumacher argued, in pursuing knowledge has forgotten wisdom. Wisdom consists in recognising what has been called the \u2018second contradiction of capitalism\u2019, not just between capital and labour but between the growth compulsion and the determinate ecosphere. The second law of thermodynamics may not explain social organisation or the origin of life, but unless it is allowed to guide our economy then the attempt to ignore entropy is going to bring us up sharp, and sooner rather than later. The key question, then, at the turn of the millennium, is how we preserve the homeliness of the world, a question for the economy and therefore the built environment; a question for the economy, and therefore for our deepest spiritual resources. To this question I turn in the final chapter. 1 R. Williams, The Country and the City (London: Hogarth, 1985), p. 11. Towards Jerusalem? One is calling to me from Seir, \u2018Sentinel, what of the night? Sentinel, what of the night?\u2019 The sentinel says: \u2018Morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire; come back again.\u2019 (Isaiah 21.11 12) At the end of his three volume analysis of the current world situation, Manuel Castells is upbeat: History is just beginning, if by history we understand the moment when, after millennia of a prehistoric batde with Nature, first to survive then to conquer it, our species has reached the level of knowledge and social organization that will allow us to live in a predominantly social world. It is the beginning of a new existence and of a new age.1 Peter Hall today seems to share this enthusiasm, but writing in 1988 he was much more cautious: The watchman on the height is calling; but his message could spell doom to the city, unless the day rises also on the city of darkness just outside the gate. There is a riddle here, so far unanswerable by the wit of planners, or indeed, of that of any other kind of social engineer; and, as the millennium approaches, it casts a deep pre dawn chill.2 This pre dawn chill seems to have evaporated at the turn of the millennium, but worries about the city of darkness just outside the gate growing poverty, growing numbers, the ability to adequately feed and house them nevertheless obtrude. Will we, Hall asks in Cities in Civilization, 1 M. Castells, End of Millennium (Oxford: Blackwell, 1998), p. 478. 2 P. Hall, Cities of Tomorrow (Oxford: Blackwell, 1988), p. 480. arrive at a world in which there is a total polarisation between the information rich and the information poor? Will there be a true urban golden age in which the minority enjoy unparalleled affluence, while a majority are left in dire poverty that is both material and spiritual?3 The answer to both questions is that this is already how the world is configured, and that, as Hall himself has argued in the past, any such contrast between wealth and poverty precludes there being any kind of golden age, urban or otherwise. A new, more positive, age \u2014 or the growth of the city of darkness outside the gate? In answering this question Castells represents an almost entirely unchastened optimism of progress which overlooks the many periods of retrogression in the past, and we would do well to learn from these periods.4 This is especially the case because, at the turn of the millennium, the balance between the alternatives outlined by Hall can hardly be said to be even. What we do with the built environment will have a decisive impact one way or the other, both in terms of our use of resources, as the last chapter made clear, but also in terms of the building of settlements which are humanly as well as materially sustaining. What ought we to do about it? Does the Church have anything to contribute? Theology, I said in the first chapter, is primarily addressed to the Church. But today \u2018Church\u2019 is one small interest group amongst countless others. What is the point of this, or of any, Christian ethical reflection? If Church structures its reflection around a particular narrative, and one full of \u2018outdated\u2019 ideas at that, as Kate Soper reminds us, what can it contribute to the common human story? If it is called to be a contrast society can it reasonably expect to have any impact on the public square? My answer to these questions is twofold. With the Irenaean tradition of theological reflection, followed by Geddes and Mumford, I take education to play a crucial role in human process. Secondly, I have argued throughout this book that the problems associated with the built environment are not primarily technical but spiritual, that is to say, they are fundamentally a question of values, of our understanding of the whole human project.5 In that respect Castells\u2019 Enlightenment talk of \u2018conquering\u2019 nature may 3 P. Hall, Cities in Civilization (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1998), p. 987. 4 We can think of the European \u2018Dark Ages\u2019 evoked by Alasdair MacIntyre at the close of After Virtue, or the downturn of expansion at the end of the thirteenth century when Europe \u2018not only halted but shrank\u2019. J. Le Goff, Medieval Civilization (Oxford: Blackwell, 1988), p. 106. One does not have to believe in history repeating itself to be made cautious by these examples. 5 Victor Papanek likewise refers to values as \u2018introducing the question of the spiritual in design\u2019. The questions he wants to put to the built environment are close to the ones I pose: \u2018Will the design... aid sustainability? Gan it make life easier for... [the] marginalized? Will it help those who are poor? Will it save energy? Gan it save irreplaceable resources?\u2019 The Green Imperative (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p 54 be something of a giveaway, for, as feminists and ecologists have been arguing for three decades now, repudiating that attitude is a precondition of our survival. SPIRITUALITY, EDUCATION AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT Writing in 1948 Paul and Percival Goodman spoke of questioning returning troops about coming home. If you ask \u2018What kind of town do you want to live in? What do you want in your post war home?\u2019 the answers reveal a banality of ideas that is hair raising, with neither rational thought nor real sentiment, the conceptions of routine and inertia rather than local patriotism or personal desire, of prejudice and advertising rather than practical experience and dream.1 2 1 P. Goodman and P. Goodman, Communitas: Means of Livelihood and IVqys of life (Now York: Random House, i960), p. 13. 2 R. Williams, \u2018Culture is Ordinary\u2019, in Resources of Hope (London: Verso, 1989), p. 4 (my italics). towns, compact Indian cities, to the Parthenon, the Dome of the Rock, to Chartres, and the Meenakshi temple, and there are spiritualities which gives rise to the unsustainable cities of Assyria and Babylon, to slums, the enclosing of rivers, Disneyworld, and the carving up of cities by grotesquely misnamed \u2018freeways\u2019. The depth of a culture\u2019s spirituality undeniably waxes and wanes, and shallow periods produce poor, or at least unjust and unstable, environments. Where do we stand at the turn of the millennium? How are we to build dwellings and fashion settlements which are, to use Christopher Day\u2019s words, life renewing, soul nurturing, and spirit strengthening? Is there any evidence that we are better placed than the people the Goodmans interviewed? The problem for the new millennium is to know what happens in the milieu of the global village, which militates against the survival of real difference, and in what seems to many the ruin of long established systems of values.1 Postmodernism, which represents what Frederick Jameson calls \u2018the structural logic of late capitalism\u2019, represents this confusion both architecturally and ethically. Architecturally it abandons itself to an eclectic quotation of vernaculars world wide, thus proclaiming like the Bauhaus that it has no ideas of its own.2 Ethically we have been reduced, says Zygmunt Bauman, to excluded vagabonds or rich tourists, moving on, uncommitted, and in danger of losing the ability to be moral.3 The banality of much postmodern building precisely signifies this loss of direction and, more than that, the covert nihilism which lies behind the rhetoric of the market. The defenders of postmodernity point out that it emphasises community, locality, place, and regional resistances, social movements and respect for otherness. \u2018At its best\u2019, Harvey remarks, \u2018it produces trenchant images of possible other worlds, and even begins to shape the actual world.\u2019 Unfortunately, at the same time, \u2018it is hard to stop the slide into parochialism, myopia, and self referentiality in the face of the universalizing force of capital circulation. At worst it brings us back to narrow and sectarian politics in which respect for others gets mutilated in the fires of competition between the fragments.\u20194 The problem is getting beyond the fragments to the emergence of Williams\u2019 common meanings. There are, of course, two ways, a positive 1 So K. Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), p. 282, and, famously, A. MacIntyre, After Virtue (London: Duckworth, 1981). 2 3 Z. Bauman, Postmodern Ethics (Oxford: Blackwell, 1993), p. 248. 4 D. Harvey, The Condition of Postmodernity (Oxford: Blackwell, 1989), p. 351. and a negative, in which this has already happened. The first is summed up by the notorious remark of the Heinz Chief Executive, Tony Reilly: \u2018Once people have television, they all want more or less the same thing.\u2019 Levis, Coke and McDonald\u2019s have formed a global culture of stunning banality, of meanings grouped around the lowest common denominator of a mythicised American youth culture, which spell death to local creativity. One could imagine a kitsch version of Le Corbusier\u2019s \u2018one universal building\u2019 as its architectural equivalent and Disneyland as its ideal settlement. If our buildings shape us as much as we shape them we have to ask what the global community is learning from the tower blocks which are to be found in virtually every city world wide. Common meanings are to some extent generated by threat, as they were by the prospect of \u2018mutually assured destruction\u2019 in the sixties and seventies of the twentieth century. Until March 2001 evidence of global warming seemed to be functioning in the same way, until the fragile results of the three Global Climate conferences were torn up by President Bush, urged on by the corporations. This action calls in question the extent to which the recognition of Earth as a \u2018lonely planet\u2019, which the former director of Greenpeace, Peter Melchett, regards as a defining moment in the growth of environmental consciousness, counters the tribalism of postmodernity.1 The climate conferences, and their sudden death, are a good illustration of the clash of rationalities, moralities or spiritualities which lie behind global capitalism on the one hand, which believes that the market will solve all problems painlessly, in this case by trading pollution rights with Third World countries, and those who believe that such manoeuvres are cynical and immoral and compromise not only the South but the future. Resistance to such solutions perhaps provides support for Bauman\u2019s conclusion that, the tribalism and aestheticism of the postmodern condition notwithstanding, moral responsibility is inalienable, unconditional and infinite. If that is the case, if that faith is justified, it will in due course issue in shared and nurturing spiritualities which draw on and make sense of the past from which we come. They will be shared, because morality is social; they will make sense of the past, because to be historically conditioned is part of what it means to be human; and they will be spiritual, informed by the spirit, which is to say the imagination, the emotion, the creativity of humankind and of each culture. For the Christian, human spirit is not identical with Holy Spirit, but the former does not exist without the latter, and represents both a 1 In a lecture at the University of Exeter, 9 February 2001. He believes satellite photographs of the earth generated this sentiment. creation of the Spirit and a response to it. This bears on our understanding of the role of the Church. In his review of future possibilities Castells remarks: \u2018Religious communes may develop into religious fundamentalist movements aimed at re moralizing society, re establishing godly, eternal values, and embracing the whole world, or at least the nearby neighbourhood, in a community of believers, thus founding a new society.\u201d3 The future of religion, in other words, is backward looking versions of identity politics. Bahro too was sceptical of the idea that the environmental crisis might offer a \u2018last chance for Christianity\u2019. \u2018As far as I can see, churches are as little capable of... transformation as states.\u201d4 But since the past conditions the present in an endless reinvention, I cannot be as pessimistic about the Church, as bearer of the narrative of kingdom, cross and resurrection, as they are. Of course religions and philosophies can die. We are unlikely to find sustenance from Marduk and Tiamat,1 2 3 4 5 or for that matter from Zoroastrianism. Perhaps the Christian narrative has had its day, as dwindling congregations around Europe seem to indicate. But perhaps, on the other hand, the gravediggers have come too early. Religions prove themselves, said Lessing, in spirit and in power, which is to say to the extent that they prove able to nurture the human soul. The indictment against Christianity is severe. All forms of the Church have involved themselves in structures of deceit and very often systematic coercion. They have been complicit with the forces of death. \u2018Can any one say without flinching or without horror\u2019, asks Marc Ellis, \u2018that Christian activity in history has been in continuity with Jesus?\u201d6 It is part of the lie in which the churches are involved that they do indeed affirm this, and of this Christians can only be deeply ashamed.'7 At the same time, any glance at the art, music and literature of the twentieth century shows that there are still extraordinary resources of depth here, that cross and resurrection 1 M. Castells, The Power of Identify (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997), p 357 2 *4 Bahro, Avoiding, p. 68. 3 13 Though as Wink points out, we may find their myth still instantiated in Pentagon power games. W. Wink, Engaging tiie Powers (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1992), pp. ijff. 4 M. Ellis, Unholy Alliance: Religion and Atrocity in our Time (London: SCM, 1997), p. 175. Cf. also Gary Wills, Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 2000), which examines, amongst other things, the role of the papacy in relation to the Holocaust, and the continuing failure to apologise for Christian anti Semitism. 5 Ellis draws attention especially to Pope John Paul\u2019s address to Latin American bishops in 1992 in which he spoke of the need for \u2018the immense wealth of Christian life to flourish\u2019 in the hearts of the Latin American people, with no acknowledgement that the Church was complicit in the conquista. He instances, also, his appointment of the chaplain to the military who murdered Oscar Romero as Romero\u2019s successor, and his refusal to visit the graves of the six Jesuits who were murdered. Unholy Alliance, p. 84. still refract human reality in hugely complex, profound and interesting ways.'8 To some extent we can measure what it is Church offers against alternatives. Ernst Bloch remarked: \u2018Only the beginnings of another society will make genuine architecture possible again.\u201d9 Recognising this imperative Bahro believed that integration was the key to the recovery of spirituality in the face of the megamachine. Only by reunification of our living spirit with its natural roots, he said, and with the wellsprings of culture, was it possible to overcome dead and alienated spirit.20 An atheist himself, he sought to draw on the resources of Asian religions, but he saw in all the religions an attempt to free us from the narrow socialisation we internalised, through which we were prepared for the exterministic civilisation of consumerism.21 Mumford believed something similar, describing it as the need for human beings to resume possession of themselves. He thought the city played a key role in the process. \u2018We must now conceive the city\u2019, he wrote, \u2018not primarily as a place of business or government, but as an essential organ for expressing and actualizing the new human personality that of \u201cOne World Man\u201d.\u201922 That hope stands in stark contrast to his pessimism in the face of the growth of the mega city. His master, Patrick Geddes, had wanted the city to be the centre for schools of local culture and envisaged a civic version of the medieval cathedral at its centre, bringing together cultural resources, ideals and knowledge.23 These proposals are reminiscent of the religions of reason of the late eighteenth century and if church history teaches Bahro scepticism surely even greater scepticism is indicated here. In view of its demonstrable creativity, the fruit of the dialectic of cross and resurrection, the facing of pain, evil, nothingness, without bitterness and without despair, why should we not look to the Church? Perhaps it still has its part to play, alongside many other voices, in the creation of those nurturing spiritualities which can teach us to build again. Nurture, in human community, means education. Presciently anticipating the \u2018end of work\u2019 debate, Mumford saw education as the main function of the city, enabling the change from a power economy to a life economy and thus global political and physical 18 Think, for example of Chagall\u2019s work in the Mus\u00e9e Nationale Biblique, in Nice; of Britten\u2019s War Requiem, the poetry of R. S. Thomas or T. S. Eliot, or the prose of Graham Greene. 19 Gf. Bloch\u2019s remark: \u2018Only the beginnings of another society will make genuine architecture possible again\u2019 (. Principle, p. 737). 20 Bahro, Avoiding, p. 172. 21 Ibid., p.201. 22 L. Mumford, The City in History (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991), p. 653. 23 P. Geddes, Cities in Evolution (London: Williams and Norgate, 1949 (orig. 1915)), chs. 13 and 14. transformations. Schumacher believed that a failure of education lay at the root of economic exterminism, the idea that growth will solve all our problems. We are suffering from a metaphysical disease, he said, by which he meant a loss of clarity respecting fundamental convictions, and therefore the cure must be metaphysical. \u2018Education which fails to clarify our central convictions is mere training or indulgence. For it is our central convictions that are in disorder, and, as long as the present anti metaphysical temper persists, the disorder will grow worse.\u20191 Clarifying central convictions is what Church is about precisely this is what brought people in fierce contest to Nicaea, Constantinople and Chalcedon. I have argued that in the shaping of the future, in finding ways to house eight or twelve billion not just with dignity but with beauty, community and citizen involvement is essential, but, as Schumacher points out, that could be disastrous in the absence of the emergence of a new, strong and deep spirituality ranked alongside the marginalised, and opposed to the powers of the big battalions. There is an urgent educational task to which Church is called. In the first chapter I spoke of the humanism of Vitruvian man, which, looking to classical sources, inspired a whole new architecture, an architecture of \u2018man the measure of all things\u2019, bold and self confident. That humanism ran into the sand in the machine age, of which the Network Society is but the latest manifestation. A key part of the problem, as we have seen at a number of points, is that technological capacities have suggested that we are free of limits. The reference point of Vitruvian man was the human body; for early twentieth century builders it was the capacities of steel; today the limits are supposedly Cyberspace. In this context John O\u2019Neill calls us to re think society with our bodies, to reject the alienating vision of robots and cyborgs.2 He effectively calls us to a new humanism, and, as noted in the first chapter, Christology necessarily has something to say to that. A new architecture springing from a Christologically refracted vision, refracted by cross and resurrection, would be an architecture and planning which recovered human scale, an architecture and planning which were modest and beautiful at the same time. In the educational task of shaping the future Church is but one voice: but it too has a voice. To understand the task of the Church like this might be the contemporary equivalent of the Isaianic theology of the Servant. The Servant, 1 E. F. Schumacher, Small is Beautiful (London: Sphere, 1974), p. 83. 2 25 J. O\u2019Neill, Five Bodies: The Human Shape of Modern Society (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985), p. 151. whether an individual or community, was not called to garner honour for him or herself but to be \u2018a light to the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth\u2019 (Isa. 49.6). If Church inherits that task, then it is first and foremost called out, imagined community for the sake of the wider human community, and wider human community for the sake of the earth which sustains us. Once again, a positive and negative task are involved. Negatively, because the poor and the planet are so threatened if the perverse logic of capital continues, putting a spoke in its operations is vital, and doing that is part of ec clesia\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. Positively, the re imagining of the world involved in \u2018mission\u2019 involves re imagining our built environment as well. This is but taking up an ancient prophetic task. Jeremiah urged the exiles to build houses in Babylon and seek the good of the city, and both Isaiah and Ezekiel dreamed at length about the new city, the city of peace and justice. None of them dreamed of a city in the next world; on the contrary, they hoped for its realisation here and now. Ernst Bloch traces architectural utopias to these ancient dreams. As he insisted, utopia is not a matter of escapism or daydreaming.1 Alternative visions are needed to change the world, says David Harvey, providing the grist for shaping powerful political forces for change. \u2018Utopian dreams... are omnipresent as the hidden signihers of our desires.\u20192 Bismarck regarded the Sermon on the Mount as utopian but for the Christian cross and resurrection are the hermeneutic of the Sermon. They announce the realism of utopia. It is in the light of the resurrection that Paul can speak of\u2018the God of hope\u2019 (Rom. 15.13). Hope, Paul already saw, contradicts the hopelessness of the present. \u2018It is in this contradiction that hope must prove its power.\u20193 Hope builds on the possibilities with which the world as it exists is pregnant, \u2018uncovering real possibilities and alternatives\u2019 in a process which Harvey calls \u2018dialectical utopianism\u2019.4 In a similar way Moltmann argues that, against the \u2018realism\u2019 of the status quo it is hope alone which is realistic \u2018because it alone takes seriously the possibilities with which all reality is fraught\u2019.30 In considering the homes and settlements in which we actually live, the spaces we occupy, the land which is occupied, I have tried to see with what possibilities they might be pregnant, which criteria might guide us toward that more human future, which Isaiah, and the Jewish and Christian traditions after him, have called \u2018Jerusalem\u2019. This 1 Bloch, Principle, pp. 1278ft. 2 D. Harvey, Spaces of Hope (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 195. 3 J. Moltmann, Theology of Hope (London: SGM, 1967), p. 19. 4 Harvey, Spaces of Hope, p. 206. 30 Moltmann, Theology of Hope, p. 25. building of a new world is in principle an unfinished task, a \u2018permanent revolution\u2019 to use a phrase of Karl Barth\u2019s.3' This revolution, we have seen, is guided by the criteria of sustainability, justice, empowerment, situatedness, and diversity. To these I want to add, in this final chapter, enchantment. Sustainability I addressed at length in the last chapter and in the discussion of house and city. In returning to these criteria in the context of the journey towards Jerusalem I turn, then, first, to the issue of justice. I. JUSTICE AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT If the demand for sustainability follows from our theology of creation, the demand for justice follows from our understanding of reconciliation. If all human beings are made in the image of God Christian theology cannot, like liberal political theorists, dismiss the demands of egalitarianism as rhetoric.1 2 It has to seek to honour that image practically, in housing as in wage and employment structures. Liberation theology sought to make this practical in terms of the \u2018priority of the poor\u2019 and for fifty years this was thought of as a North South issue. At the end of the millennium, however, Manuel Castells has argued that the growth of the global economy has changed the global pattern of wealth and poverty, power and powerlessness. The old categories of developed and underdeveloped, First World and Third World, North and South, are no longer analytically useful. Rather, Castells speaks of the rise of a Fourth World, \u2018made up of multiple black holes of social exclusion throughout the planet\u2019. It comprises much of sub Saharan Africa, Latin America and Asia, but is to be found in the inner cities of the United States and Europe as well. Throughout the world there are \u2018millions of homeless, incarcerated, prostituted, criminalized, brutalized, stigmatized, sick and illiterate persons\u2019 growing in number everywhere, as informational capitalism, and the political breakdown of the welfare state, intensify social exclusion.3 The gap between rich and poor continues to grow and this inevitably has repercussions in housing. A walkabout of any great city 1 Harvey, Spaces of Hope, p. 237, talks of the \u2018permanent revolution5 in spatial forms, echoing a famous article by Paul Lehmann which described Karl Barth as the \u2018theologian of permanent revolution, taking up a phrase from Barth\u2019s commentary on Romans. (Union Theological Seminary Review 28/1 (1972)). This happily brings theology and the built environment into the closest working relationship. 2 As for example John Gray, Beyond, the New Right (London: Routledge, 1994). Duncan Forrester has now re stated the Christian case for equality in On Human Worth (London: SCM, 2001). 3 Castells, End of Millennium, pp. 164 5. on earth makes clear that this is one of the areas where injustice is most manifest. Globally the citizens of the Fourth World live in favelas, shanty towns, tent cities, without water or sewage, in tenements or sink estates, with rising damp, poor access, poor schools and high crime rates. Hardly surprising that foremost among the demands of Agenda 21 is the provision of adequate shelter for all. Social justice is currently an unfashionable issue, and the \u2018Social Justice\u2019 Report prepared for the British Labour Party before the 1997 election eschewed the idea of \u2018levelling\u2019 as harmfully unrealistic (which meant unelectable). Wealth creation not redistribution is the agenda. But when the richest Mexican earns more than the poorest 17 million Mexicans; when, in 1998, three billionaires earned more than all the less developed nations at the United Nations; when half of the world\u2019s largest economies are centrally planned for the benefit of less than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s people, the suspicion that redistribution might still be on the agenda crosses the mind.34 In the light of the incarnation, it simply cannot be avoided. The old name for the organised struggle for equity was socialism, in the non dogmatic sense George Orwell affirmed in The Road to Wigan Pier: \u2018We have got to fight for justice and liberty, and Socialism does mean justice and liberty when the nonsense is stripped off it.\u201935 The events of 1989 notwithstanding, the need to fashion a sustainable socialist society remains a necessity first because it is demanded by our understanding of what is demanded by the creation of human beings in the image of God, but also because injustice is unsustainable, and wherever you find it you find the attempt to overthrow it. Unjust societies are unstable societies, societies not destined to last. No sustainability without justice, and no justice without sustainability, to paraphrase Rosa Luxemburg. In spelling out what is meant by \u2018justice\u2019 Iris Marion Young speaks of the \u2018five faces\u2019 of oppression exploitation, marginalisation, powerlessness, cultural imperialism and violence.3\u00ae It is easy to see how all these dimensions manifest themselves in the built environment: exploitation in 34 The figures are from United Nations Development Programme Reports. Less than i % of the world\u2019s population own stocks and shares, but fifty of the world\u2019s largest economies are transnational corporations, answerable only to their shareholders. Opponents of the idea of social justice, like John Gray or Joseph Raz, maintain that the presence of structural inequality in society does not mean anyone is wronged by it. This could be the case in the world of philosophical debating points, but is not the case anywhere in the real world, where inequalities always go together with vastly different life chances. 35 G. Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1962), p. 205. 36 I. M. Young Justice and the Politics of Difference (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990), pp. 42 ff. the rack renting the poor are subject to; marginalisation in the formation of sink estates and \u2018no go areas\u2019; powerlessness in the lack of consultation and control over their circumstances; cultural imperialism in the destruction of vernacular patterns, violence in the proneness to street crime of poor areas, and the greater risk of car accidents for children. Harvey is sceptical of egalitarian notions of justice because of the conundrum that equal treatment of unequals increases inequality. In a later publication he implicitly recognises that the acceptance of a belief in the equality of persons requires \u2018[fjundamental redefinitions of wealth, well being, and values... in ways that are more conducive to the development of human potentialities of all segments of the population\u2019.1 We do not have to be starry eyed about building ourselves into paradise to see that all of the dimensions Young highlights not only can be but are often addressed in examples of good practice around the world.2 \u2018Concrete utopias\u2019 are not just dreamable but attainable. What political will is it, then, which prevents their realisation? II. EMPOWERMENT The demand for empowerment follows, I have been arguing, from that text which speaks so powerfully to our present, the demand that all the Lord\u2019s people should be prophets. As we have seen there are a wide range of competing, and to some extent contradictory, options about the future of the built environment. Who is to decide between them? Much planning is currently obstructive of people\u2019s creativity. At the same time the environmental crisis has underlined the fact that we cannot live without it. How is that contradiction to be resolved? The key point is that ordinary people, the whole community, have to be part of the process. This is implicit in the Church\u2019s community charter, 1 Corinthians 12, the hierarchy and the power structures of the Church notwithstanding. Where Jesus spoke of \u2018kingdom\u2019 Paul spoke of \u2018body\u2019, a body which itself constituted \u2018the body of Christ\u2019, which was the body of Christ this side of the resurrection. The whole body was \u2018in spired\u2019, breathed through and empowered by Spirit. The whole body had gifts to offer. And since the source of these gifts was the same in each case it was impossible to value one gift 1 D. Harvey, Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 436. 2 Everyone will be able to offer their own examples of good practice. Dundee, in Scotland, illustrates excellent examples offine post World War I estates, built on Unwinesque principles, which remain beautiful and well maintained; 1960s estates which are unlettable and vandalised, a sink for drugs and crime; and housing association developments in the late 1990s which try to capitalise on the natural beauty of the city and offer affordable housing which is not just decent but beautiful. above another. For this reason, though there is a variety of gifts, the whole community contributes to the process of shaping the future. The need for empowerment was recognised by the founding fathers of town planning, people like Floward, Geddes and Kropotkin, who thought of planning as a popular movement and regarded citizen participation to be the key. For Geddes, every citizen should have an understanding of the possibilities of his or her own city.1 What the need for democratic planning emphasises is that place, and not just shared interest, continues to be constitutive of community. The more power leaches into Castell\u2019s \u2018space of flows\u2019 the less genuine democracy, the less real debate about the things that matter in the fabric of our lives, there can be. Place, then, and planning in relation to place, is at the heart of the future of democracy. In 1977 Robert Fishman targeted the loss of common meaning or purpose as the root of the hostility to planning which was so marked a feature of that decade, at the same time observing that the energy crisis might lead to a return to it. The absurdities and disasters of the planning process are well documented, obstructing, as they do, not so much the out of town developers but those seriously concerned for low impact development. John Turner and Colin Ward\u2019s plea, which goes back forty years now, for people to have the freedom to express themselves in self build developments is very well taken. At the same time the demands of sustainability make a planning process which can obstruct the rich and powerful, rather than the poor and marginal, an imperative. Voting and shopping patterns, and the behaviour of the house market, show quite clearly that sustainable development has not yet become the new form of the common good, as some have hoped. For this reason, as I have already argued, the process of education to further that end is imperative.2 Without it devolved decision making will be likely to function to reinforce the power of elite groups, as it tends to be better educated people who get involved in such strategies. \u2018The talkers nearly always win, and these tend to be the professionals, or those few activists who speak on the community\u2019s behalf without necessarily having the community\u2019s real backing. So this is a pyrrhic victory.\u20193 Citizen 1 Geddes, Cities, ch. 13. 2 4 \u00b0 M. Breheny, \u2018Centrists, Decentrists and Compromisers: Views of the Future of Urban Form\u2019, in M. Jenks, E. Burton and K. Williams (eds.), The Compact City: A Sustainable Urban Form? (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 20. 3 4 1 T. Gibson, \u2018The Neighbourhood as a Hidden Resource\u2019, in J. Miller and V Mega (eds.), The Improvement of the Built Environment and Social Integration in Cities (Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities 1992), p. 242. The problem was confirmed to me repeatedly at a conference of Liverpool clergy with whom I discussed these ideas. Many of them are involved in administering regeneration budgets, and all confirmed that such money, participation has been a buzz word since the Habitat Conference of 1976, but the reality is often another form of political manipulation.42 The fact is that, whilst representative democracy is a great gain over the autocracies which preceded it, we are still in the infant stage when it comes to the effective realisation of democracy. In the age of mass media democracy is often confused with populism, but in fact not only are they not the same, but democracy cannot survive alongside populism. The Press Barons are a greater threat to democracy than were the old dictatorships which, with their crude methods and use of force, generated a counter discourse. The empowerment we need in relation to the built environment is, then, part and parcel of the wider political problem of the realisation of democracy. As Habraken and Turner argue, changes in the way we build could effectively change our understanding of politics. Acknowledging the democratic deficit, liberation theology from the start drew on the work of Paulo Freire and his practice of conscientisation, recognising that the education needed is not simply imparting information, but also cultivating the values which underpin practical politics. As I noted in chapter 7, most neighbourhoods are densely honeycombed with community groups of various sorts, church being one. For much of its history church has avowed a hierarchical and authoritarian structure, and in many of its current manifestations it still does. Where we take Paul\u2019s struggles in the first letter to the Corinthians seriously, however, this cannot be the case. Learning to be church involves learning to value the gifts of all, involves a practical egalitarianism, an understanding of shared decision making which is a profound anticipation and training for democracy on a wider stage. III. SITUATEDNESS In the discussion of the land, I noted the importance of the theme of rest in Israel\u2019s history. \u2018Rest\u2019 is not a purely eschatological promise, as Augustine thought. It has concrete manifestations here and now, as we see clearly ostensibly premised on empowerment, failed to reach and to benefit the poorest members of the community. Disenchantment with political process was so great in one ward that turnout for local elections was a mere five per cent. 42 So S. Kjellberg, Urban EcoTheohgy (Utrecht: International Books, 2000), p. 85. The Habitat Conference recommended that communities should be involved in planning, that standards for shelter and services should be based on the felt needs of the population, and that, since public participation is a right for everyone, special efforts should be made to strengthen the role of community organisations. R. J. Skinner and M. J. Rodell (eds.), People, Poverty and Shelter: Problems of Self Help Housing in the Third World (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 13. from the biblical narratives (Josh. 21.44; 2 Sam. 7.1). What the Deutero nomic writers call \u2018rest\u2019 is what Heidegger speaks of as \u2018dwelling\u2019, and what I call here situatedness. As we saw in the second chapter, Castells\u2019 analysis is that what he calls the \u2018Network Society\u2019 is fundamentally split between, on the one hand, the \u2018space of flows\u2019 and its actors, and the \u2018space of place\u2019 in which most human experience and meaning is still based. Environmental localism challenges the priorities of global capital, driven by an (anti) economic rationality which has no respect for place. The dominant global elites live in the space of flows and consist of \u2018identity less individuals\u2019 while, on the other hand, \u2018people resisting economic, cultural, and political disfranchisement tend to be attracted to communal identity\u2019.43 The idea that we really live in \u2018the space of flows\u2019, however, is a day dream of metaphysical idealists. There are, of course, Bauman\u2019s \u2018tourists\u2019, the wealthy for whom the entire world is a playground, but even they have to educate their children somewhere, and that implies some degree of permanence. The complete rootlessness of a playboy existence can never be an option for more than a tiny percentage of people. In fact, the vast majority of human beings seek out and cultivate the goods of place. Whilst social mobility is exceptionally high, whether for political, religious, or economic reasons, rootedness remains vital to the human sense of well being and thus, as Castells agrees, \u2018nimbyism\u2019 (not in my back yard) is not necessarily to be despised. It is one thing when rich communities attack the siting of prisons, asylums or waste treatment plants in their neighbourhood; it is another when local communities are fighting multi national capital. This can give rise to what he calls resistance or project identities. The communes of resistance defend their space, their places, against the placeless logic of the space of flows characterizing social domination in the Information Age. They claim their historic memory, and/or affirm the permanence of their values, against the dissolution of history in timeless time, and the celebration of the ephemeral in the culture of real virtuality.44 Territorial identity continues to have an important role to play in this, even though, in an age of migrations, common memories may often not go back more than a couple of decades. That the preservation of more ancient memories is vital is evident in the \u2018heritage\u2019 movement to be found, in one form or another, all over the world. However undesirable much of this movement is, and its hijacking either by commercial interests or by the state is certainly to be deplored, it signifies the widespread recognition that memory loss is a pathology which attacks the very roots of our identity. There is a balancing act here, between, on the one hand, idealised versions of the past, and on the other complete loss of the particularity of cultural, economic and physical identity.1 Church has a long experience in this area, as the discussion of inculturation in mission demonstrates. As Lamin Sanneh argues, it has been part of the genius of the gospel to go into the vernacular in every place, thus stimulating local cultures, renewing them, and sowing seeds of revolution.2\u00ae Following Jeremiah it is essential for it to dwell, which is why, contrary to the desires of missionary bishops, churches have put up buildings everywhere, providing foci and facilities for the meeting and growth of local community. IV. DIVERSITY At Pentecost the scattering which takes place at Babel is not reversed, but confirmed as a blessing. All the different languages, the roots of culture, do not blend in some ethereal Esperanto. On the contrary, they become mutually intelligible. The \u2018oneness\u2019 of the Church is, as Moltmann rightly insists, a unity in diversity.3 There is a promise of reconciliation precisely through the celebration of diversity. The same goes for the built environment. Thomas Sharp was right: a homogenised environment is a poor environment. A world composed primarily of suburbs, or edge cities, or mega cities, or a world which was just \u2018rurban\u2019, would be the poorer. Human beings thrive on difference. Discussions of \u2018cities of difference\u2019 tend to focus on the need to guarantee respect for different lifestyles, on finding space for the legitimacy of all groups. What this respect for difference has actually generated, however, is that postmodern eclecticism in which all true difference disappears. Until the mid twentieth century the difficulty of travel effectively guaranteed the persistence of difference. Ideas of course did travel: the arch went from ancient Greece, to the Muslim Near East, and then back to Europe, but over a period of more than a thousand years. Today, in a city like San Francisco where, as Harvey puts it, the minorities make up the majority, real difference is obscured \u2018through construction of images 1 G. Haughton and C. Hunter, Sustainable Cities (London: Regional Studies Association, 1994), P 311 2 L. Sanneh, Encountering the West (London: Marshall Pickering, 1993). 3 J. Moltmann, The Church in the Power of the Spirit (London: SGM, 1977), p. 342. and reconstructions, costume dramas, staged ethnic festivals, etc.\u2019.48 In Castells\u2019 terms, the coming of the space of flows leads to the generalisation of ahistorical, acultural architecture.49 \u2018Irony becomes the preferred mode of expression... Because we do not belong any longer to any place, to any culture, the extreme version of postmodernism imposes its codified code breaking logic anywhere something is built.\u201950 This architecture, writes Jeffrey Cook, amounts to the \u2018international trivialization of human life\u2019.51 Against that view there are those who argue that ordinary people symbolically mark their localities in inventive ways \u2018against the new rootless cultural imperialists\u2019, but this may underestimate the extent to which our buildings shape us.52 In the interests of the homeliness of the world common meanings have to honour the spiritualities, and therefore individualities, often millennia. Global meanings need to express themselves through local meanings. Malcolm Wells offers us an evaluation scale for our new buildings, charting their sustainability rating but also asking, finally, whether they are beautiful or destroy beauty.53 I wish to add the criterion of respect for indigenous cultures. This is not to advocate that we all live in tepees or igloos. It is to argue that the world is a far poorer place if we let the diversity of human exploration be swilled down the drain. Once again, Church experience of inculturation is important here. Though the British empire, in an acute loss of imagination, sought to generalise gothic everywhere as the image of what a church must be, there has never been one image, one heavenly archetype, of what a church building should look like. All local vernaculars have been assimilated to express the gospel. In this respect Church practice ought to provide a model for secular practice. ENCHANTEDNESS I argued in the first chapter that the roots of secularisation were to be found in the Hebrew bible. The ancient world was de divinised. It ' Harvey, Condition, p. 87. 49 M. Castells, The Rise ofthe Network Society (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 418. 5 \u00b0 Ibid., p. 376. 5 1 J. Cook, \u2018Environmentally benign architecture\u2019, in R. Samuels and D. Prasad, Global Warming and the Built Environment (London: Spon, 1996), p. 132. 5 2 A. Cohen and K. Fukui (eds.), Humanising the City? Social Contexts of Urban Life at the Turn of the Millennium (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1993), p. 217. 53 Malcolm Wells, \u2018Underground Architecture\u2019, Co evolution Quarterly (Sausalito, California) 11 (Autumn 1976), p. 89. was not, however, robbed of enchantment, as the psalms and the final chapters of Job show and as the Franciscan tradition in Christianity has especially emphasised. Max Weber famously appropriated a line of Schiller in speaking of the disenchantment of the world. For him this was on the whole a good thing, because it signified our freeing from fate, but good or bad there was no option but to bear it. Today, says Castells, \u2018[sjocieties are finally and truly disenchanted because all wonders are on line and can be combined into self constructed image worlds\u2019.1 In fact, however, the world remains an enchanted place, as reality has a habit of asserting itself over against virtuality, in both the difficulties and delights of relationships, in the immediacies of every kind of cultural experience, from the pub and caf\u00e9 to the theatre and concert hall, and in our encounter with both the natural world and many parts of the built environment. After romanticism the temptation is to think of enchantment as an aspect especially of the natural world, but there are many enchanting villages, towns, and cities, and houses and gardens too can be full of enchantment. By this I mean places which allure us with their beauty, which call us to a halt, which refresh us with their charm and are a positive ease and delight for the spirit. Christopher Day makes the creation of such places the aim of his architectural practice. The world\u2019s beauty has not, in fact, disappeared just as space exploration has not dimmed the beauty of the moon. This is not to say that enchantment can be taken for granted, as the recent struggle in Scotland to prevent chairlifts to the centre of the Cairngorm plateau, or the wrecking of Thailand\u2019s most beautiful beach in the interests of Hollywood, remind us. Gerard Manley Hopkins\u2019 protest that the world \u2018wears man\u2019s smudge and shares man\u2019s smell\u2019 has more cause now than when it was written, and we are called to be vigilant. But equally, as he goes on to say, And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last lights off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs Because the Holy Ghost over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.2 ",

        "A THEOLOGY OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT Justice, Empowerment, Redemption T.",
        "GORRINGE Preface For nearly a millennium and a half after Aristotle, economics was understood as a sub discipline of ethics.",
        "In the nineteenth century this connection was severed, with disastrous consequences for both people and planet from which we are only just beginning to retrieve ourselves.",
        "The case was not so bad for architecture and town planning, though even here brutalist and technocratic understandings of the human spread their poison almost everywhere.",
        "Wittingly or unwittingly every design for council estates, every barrio, every skyscraper, every out of town supermarket, expresses a view of the human, embodies an ethic.",
        "As I have noted in another context, ethics is the conversation of the human race about its common project, about where it is going and why it wants to go there.",
        "There are life affirming, but there have also been many life denying, ethical systems.",
        "Recognising this, the authors of Deuteronomy called their fellow countrymen to choose between two ways, a way of life and a way of death.",
        "We know only too well that there are ways of life and of death in the built environment.",
        "Though they certainly did not get everything right, the authors of Deuteronomy took their stand on belief in the liberating power of the God of life.",
        "Five hundred years after they wrote Jesus of Nazareth endorsed that stand.",
        "Reflecting on what he stood for, John put into his mouth the words: \u2018I am come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.\u2019 Christianity, and therefore theology, has to be concerned with architecture and town planning because it seeks life in all its fullness.",
        "No theology can dialogue solely with its own tradition, solely with other theologians.",
        "I have learned hugely from John Turner, Colin Ward, Nicholas Habraken, Christopher Day, David Harvey, whose class on Capital I was part of in Oxford, Richard Sennett, Peter Hall and Lewis Mumford.",
        "Mumford\u2019s contribution in particular calls for reassessment, for he wrote as a unique kind of ethicist, centrally concerned with the built environment and, as Rudolf Bahro noted, he was a genuinely prophetic figure.",
        "It is imperative Christians learn from him.",
        "This book began with an invitation to address religious education teachers on the ethics of the built environment, and the material in it has been shared with clergy and laity in Britain, Germany, Norway and Canada.",
        "Whatever its inadequacies, I have found people eagerly engaged with the theme, and I am grateful for the many challenges these audiences provided.",
        "Iona Gorringe has been a constant companion in reflecting on the built environment on countless journeys in Scotland and England, and her enthusiasm for the project has always been profoundly encouraging.",
        "Readers will quickly become aware of my debt to Hugo Gorringe, and in particular his work on the constructed space of Dalit communities in South India.",
        "He has kept me supplied with a constant supply of relevant articles.",
        "I am grateful for Kevin Taylor\u2019s faith in the project at Cambridge, and also to Norman Shanks, for allowing me to offer this piece of work as my Mainland Project for membership of the Iona Community.",
        "The book was begun in Dundee and finished in Exeter.",
        "Here Arthur Hannabuss and John Escott have exemplified the unpretentiousness and skill of vernacular building which I urge as, in part, an answer to our present discontents.",
        "No two people could make clearer both the limits of what conventionally we call \u2018education\u2019, and the profundity of a true education, the product of countless generations of skill, commonsense and craftsmanship.",
        "Without them the book could quite literally not have been written, as there would have been no roof under which to write it.",
        "The book is dedicated with affection to an architect and a drama teacher and theologian who are a source of inspiration in this area as in others.",
        "TIM GORRINGE Exeter Feast of St Benedict 2001 The theology of the built environment Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart...",
        "write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.",
        "(Deuteronomy 6.6 9) To be human is to be placed: to be born in this house, hospital, stable (according to Luke), or even, as in the floods in Mozambique in 2000, in a tree.",
        "It is to live in this council house, semi detached, tower block, farmhouse, mansion.",
        "It is to go to school through these streets or lanes, to play in this alley, park, garden; to shop in this market, that mall; to work in this factory, mine, office, farm.",
        "These facts are banal, but they form the fabric of our everyday lives, structuring our memories, determining our attitudes.",
        "How, as Christians, should we think of them? Are they a proper subject for theological reflection? Here and there great theologians, notably Aquinas and Calvin, have glanced in this direction, but the built environment forms no kcus in theological ethics except insofar as it has dealt with land and property, and with the city as a metaphor for community, or our final destination.1 It is in ethics that theology has engaged with the concrete \u2014 with war, economics, work, sexuality.",
        "Why not, then, with the built environment? We are invited to do that by the very terminology involved.",
        "Paul constantly urges his congregations to \u2018edify\u2019 one another.",
        "The word \u2018edify\u2019 comes from the Latin aedificare, to build.2 The metaphorical use of the word points to a profound truth about the built environment.",
        "Form follows function; buildings serve a purpose.",
        "For good or ill buildings, from the humblest garden shed to the grandest cathedral, make moral statements.",
        "Learning from Barth, I take it for granted that for the theologian ethics and dogmatics cannot be separated.",
        "They are continuous sections 1 Land is the theme of the third chapter, and the city of the sixth.",
        "2 A point made by K.",
        "Harries, The Ethical Function of Architecture (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT, 1998), p.",
        "The Greek word Paul uses, oikodomeo, has the same literal and metaphorical meaning.",
        "on the theological railway, not a main line (dogmatics) and a branch line (ethics).",
        "In that case, what is called for is a theological reading of the built environment.",
        "This will differ from other ethical accounts in its reference to a primarily narrative frame.",
        "Like teleological ethics, it will raise the question of the purpose of our building and planning; it will always ask about context, and to this extent resemble situation ethics; in the ongoing debate which constitutes church life it will seek to discern the command of God in this area as in others; in all cases it will be concerned with the way in which the built environment furthers human virtue or destroys it.",
        "But in each case it will do so in reference to the narratives which give us our account of the Triune God: the stories of creation, reconciliation, redemption.",
        "To the question, \u2018Where do we find the measure of the validity of a given form of architecture or planning?\u2019 it will reply precisely in these narratives and their explication.1 The point of this is not, of course, to teach planners and architects what to do.",
        "As Hans Urs von Balthasar has said, \u2018Christianity has no direct competence in the realm of worldly structures.\u2019 This has not prevented theologians from drawing up quite precise guidelines for economic structures, as in the theories of the \u2018just price\u2019 and the \u2018just wage\u2019 and in Catholic Social Teaching, or for armed combat, as in the so called just war theory\u2019.",
        "These theories follow, because, as von Balthasar goes on, the gospel \u2018sends Christians into the world with an image of the human whereby and according to which they are to organise its structures as responsibly as they can\u2019.2 Perhaps this is still to state the matter too ecclesiocentrically.",
        "In his work in Finnish cities Seppo Kjellberg has sought to understand theology as a science of reconciliation, promoting interdisciplinary dialogue, bringing all concerned with questions of the built environment together, but offering as its own perspective an understanding of the overall purpose of humankind within creation.3 We can accept this if we understand \u2018reconciliation\u2019 in Barth\u2019s sense, as the vivifying and revolutionary action of God within human community seeking the realisation of life in all its fullness for all people.",
        "If \u2018reconciliation\u2019 meant the Church adopting a managerial role, \u2018mediating\u2019 between rich and poor, bosses and workers, oppressors and oppressed, pouring the oil of middle axioms on the troubled waters of social conflict, it would certainly be untrue to the gospel.",

        "In view of the silence of the tradition it is essential to insist that Christian theology has at its core a vision of the human which is especially pertinent to the built environment.",
        "In his Ten Books of Architecture, written in the first century bc, the Roman architect and engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio gave a description of the geometry of the human body which formulated the principles of classical architecture, rediscovered and taken up again at the Renaissance.1 For many centuries this perception provided the ground rules for an architectural practice which was by definition humanist, which sought and built according to human scale.",
        "For Vitruvius, in fact, we become human only as we build.2 In the twentieth century another architect, Rudolph Schwartz, who regarded ethics as determinative for architecture, gave further expression to this principle.3 Building, he said, is done with the whole body, so that it is the movements of the body which create living space.",
        "What then comes into being is first and foremost circumscribed space shelter, living space, ceremonial space, a space which replaces the space of the world.",
        "We could almost say, and indeed it is true, that building is based on the inner spaciousness of the body, on dre knowledge of its extent and the form of its growth, on the knowledge of its articulation and of its power to expand.",
        "Indeed it is with the body that we experience building, with the outstretched arms and the pacing feet, with the roving glance and with the ear, and above all else in breathing.",
        "Space is dancingly experienced.4 1 The passage runs: \u2018For if a man be placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom.",
        "And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square figure may be found from it.",
        "For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of plane surfaces which are perfectly square.\u2019 Vitruvius, The Ten Books of Architecture, tr.",

        "This is a profound expression of the Vitruvian view, though the conclusion is more of an eschatological hope than a lived reality.",
        "In the twentieth century such humanist architecture was more the exception than the rule, as this kind of humanism was discarded in favour of a brutalist technocracy for which \u2018man\u2019 was a \u2018machine\u2019 and buildings, accordingly, \u2018machines for living in\u2019.10 At the same time, from Patrick Geddes onwards, sociologists have seen that if utopia cannot be produced by building better, at least the reverse is true, that there are environments which generate crime and physical and mental ill health.11 Balthasar is right: in relation to the built environment the recovery of a new humanism is an urgent need, and in this Christian theology, as one dialogue partner amongst many, certainly has a role to play.",
        "Kjellberg, however, points out that the anthropocentrism of earlier Christian theology is inadequate.",
        "What is needed is what he calls a \u2018cosmological holism\u2019, which understands creation and incarnation, doctrine and ethics, together.12 Balthasar is right that the church\u2019s involvement in the city was always based on the doctrine of the incarnation, the idea of the \u2018humanity of God\u2019.13 However, he seems to have forgotten what otherwise he has learned from Barth, that there is no theological assertion without its ethical correlate.",

        "As that which forms our \u2018third skin\u2019, however, I want to argue that the built environment relates to every area of Christian ethics, and that only a Trinitarian ethic, an ethic of creation, reconciliation, and redemption, is adequate to explore it.",

        "The Messianic writings, the narratives which speak of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, together with all the texts which they presuppose, provide us with criteria to discern that work.'5 It is on these grounds that Aquinas, when turning his mind to the city, noted that there are two aspects of the work of God in the world, creation and governance, and invited rulers and planners to an analogous practice: One who is about to establish a city or a realm must, in the first place, choose a suitable site; healthy, to ensure the health of the inhabitants; fertile to provide for their sustenance; one which will delight the eye with its loveliness and give natural security against hostile attack...",
        "Having chosen the site, the next task which confronts the founder of a city or a kingdom is to plan the area to meet all the requirements of civic life...",
        "one must decide where to build towns and where to leave the countryside open, or to construct fortifications: centres of study open places for military training, and markets, all have to be taken into consideration: otherwise neither city nor kingdom would long endure attack.1 2 This activity, the activity of establishing a city and setting up civic life, is not outwith the remit of theology and Church precisely because of God\u2019s activity in creation and providence.",

        "There were, of course, very good reasons for the emergence of the divide between sacred and secular, specifically the desire to avoid the worst of all forms of government, theocracy.4 Here above all we see how religion can lead us into the valley of the shadow of death.",

        "The arrangement of cities, the forms of the built environment, the relation of town and country, he showed, in an argument now fundamental to most geographical and sociological theory, all express a particular vision of the world, an ideology.",

        "\u2018Thus does the symbolic order of a city\u2019s spaces impose upon us ways of thinking and doing which reinforce existing patterns of social life.\u20192 Not just the city either, for the physical plan of Indian villages was designed to reinforce deference and submission, as was the relation of great house and labourer\u2019s cottage in Europe.",
        "The relation between space and ideology is dialectical: ideology is dependent on space, but our use of space both expresses and affects our ideology.",

        "But is it sound theology to restrict talk of the incarnation solely to the Christ event, and does it not in fact have profound implications for our social and political practice, as Christian socialists have always claimed?

        "Habel defines the term thus: \u2018A nahalah, in its primary meaning, is not something simply handed down from generation to generation, but the entitlement or rightful property of a party that is legitimated by a recognized social custom, legal process, or divine charter.\u2019 The terms he prefers to use to translate it are \u2018portion\u2019, \u2018share\u2019, \u2018entitlement\u2019, \u2018allotment\u2019, and \u2018rightful property\u2019.2 In the light of current discussions of a \u2018stakeholder economy\u2019 we could also use the phrase \u2018stake in the land\u2019.",

        "But how is it possible to understand the gift of land as justificatio impii in the light of what Habel correctly identifies as texts of terror? A number of responses to this question may be made.",
        "The first, which has effectively been the strategy of liberation theology, is to adopt the thesis of Norman Gottwald that there never was a conquest, but that a small group of escaped slaves joined up with marauding bands coming down from the north and the peasantry of the Canaanite city states to overthrow the petty rulers of Canaan, and establish an egalitarian tribal federation, which lasted for something like two hundred years.",
        "Not conquest, then, but a people\u2019s revolution.1 Even if one is disposed to accept this reading of what actually happened, however, it does not change the way historically Scripture has been understood and acted upon, nor the way the text as it stands seems to ask to be read.",

        "Also in favour of a less spiritualised reading of the New Testament we can note, first, that it derives from the period of the Roman occupation of Palestine, and deliberately distances itself from the Zealot struggle for freedom, which was judged to be either impractical or insufficiently radical.",

Deploy all the critical powers of deconstruction and semiotics to seek new and engaging interpretations of graffiti which say, \u2018Die, Yuppie scum\u2019? Should we join revolutionary and anarchist groups and fight for the rights of the poor and culturally marginalised to express their rights and if necessary make a home for themselves in the park?

        "The separation of work from domestic life was occurring in the late 18th century as a result of changes in production technology and business organization which made the home an unsuitable or impossible place formany kinds oftrade and manufacture; the emphasis on personal religious and moral responsibility and behaviour from the Glapham sect, whose message was powerfully reinforced by the French revolution and fears of disorderly irreligious mobs gave a central role to the family as the main instrument of moral education; and the socially segregated suburb of separate family houses shordy emerged to supply the ideal environment for practising the newly reformed life style incorporating these religious, moral and social aspirations.2 These changes gradually spread by cultural seepage, and were generalised in the great suburban estates of the mid twentieth century, which had real advantages.",

        "The rural feeling of the village, Sharp argued, does not depend on any of those things that are popularly associated with it: flowering gardens, irregular, informal and quaint buildings, and so on.",
        "\u2018It seems to depend on much smaller and more subtle things, upon a certain modesty, a certain lack of the smooth, mechanical finish of the town, and above all upon the harmony of the material of its buildings with the countryside.\u20191 In other words, he denies that an aesthetic of charm is at the heart of it, but rather one of harmony.",
        "Rapoport does not contradict this in saying that a village environment implies a variety of architecture and a degree of incoherence: different styles, materials of roof pitches, buildings at different angles, interesting and intimate groupings, natural vegetation, mixed age and income and lack of uniformity.2 3 Incoherence and lack of uniformity by no means exclude harmony, the fittingness which Wolterstorff finds at the heart of art.",

        "The fishing villages on the east coast of Fife emerge from the rocks which form their small harbours, braced against the onshore winds, whilst the Cornish fishing villages nestle round their coves.",
        "In each case, according to Sharp, \u2018the essence of true village character and good village design is simply simplicity\u2019.1 In these ways they instantiate an aesthetics of creation, responding sympathetically to the environment, rather than trying to \u2018tame\u2019 it, which would be true, too, for the cities Kostoff discusses under \u2018organic\u2019 forms.",

        "The report represented, says Edwards, a rediscovery of the principles of Sitte, an application of the landscape architect\u2019s preoccupation with \u2018genius loci\u2019.1 There are obvious affinities with organic planning.",
        "The difference between the organic towns of the middle ages and modern suburbia, says Kostoff, is that in the medieval town rich and poor lived side by side, whilst suburbs were effectively zoned by class.2 The problem for suburbia came in its increasing generalisation, and the need to provide mass housing at a relatively low cost.",

        "The Victorians failed to see, he says, that the quality of a scene is less a matter of the forms of its buildings than of the scale of its constituents, the nature of its floorscape and the character of its spaces.2 He identified five problems with suburban aesthetics: duality of content, which is an inevitable aspect of the suburban ideal except at arcadian densities; its monotony, caused by the need to provide large estates of virtually identical buildings; its weakness of scale, caused by the fact that economy and convenience set a limit of two stories to the height of these dwellings, while the cost of land, the need to avoid overshadowing, and the householder\u2019s preference for private, rather than communal gardens, deny suburbia the space for tall forest trees; its resdess silhouette and formless spaces, which result from a multiplicity of detached or semi detached houses, and its fragmented floorscape which is caused by man\u2019s desire for a garden beside his home, together with the drives and carriageways that are a necessary concomitant of a garage.3 It is difficult to deny these problems.",

        "A meeting of economists in 1987 rejected the very idea of limits which could not be taken care of by capital.1 As David Korten points out this follows because to accept the reality of physical limits is to accept the need to limit greed and acquisition in favour of economic justice and sufficiency.2 In order to survive, therefore, capitalism is necessarily, and not just contingently, committed to inculcating in us the reign of perverse and inordinate desire.",

        "Environmental localism challenges the priorities of global capital, driven by an (anti) economic rationality which has no respect for place.",
        "The dominant global elites live in the space of flows and consist of \u2018identity less individuals\u2019 while, on the other hand, \u2018people resisting economic, cultural, and political disfranchisement tend to be attracted to communal identity\u2019.43 The idea that we really live in \u2018the space of flows\u2019, however, is a day dream of metaphysical idealists.",
        "There are, of course, Bauman\u2019s \u2018tourists\u2019, the wealthy for whom the entire world is a playground, but even they have to educate their children somewhere, and that implies some degree of permanence.",
        "The complete rootlessness of a playboy existence can never be an option for more than a tiny percentage of people.",
        "In fact, the vast majority of human beings seek out and cultivate the goods of place.",
        "Whilst social mobility is exceptionally high, whether for political, religious, or economic reasons, rootedness remains vital to the human sense of well being and thus, as Castells agrees, \u2018nimbyism\u2019 (not in my back yard) is not necessarily to be despised.",
        "It is one thing when rich communities attack the siting of prisons, asylums or waste treatment plants in their neighbourhood; it is another when local communities are fighting multi national capital.",
        "This can give rise to what he calls resistance or project identities.",
        "The communes of resistance defend their space, their places, against the placeless logic of the space of flows characterizing social domination in the Information Age.",
        "They claim their historic memory, and/or affirm the permanence of their values, against the dissolution of history in timeless time, and the celebration of the ephemeral in the culture of real virtuality.44 Territorial identity continues to have an important role to play in this, even though, in an age of migrations, common memories may often not go back more than a couple of decades.",
        "That the preservation of more ancient memories is vital is evident in the \u2018heritage\u2019 movement to be found, in one form or another, all over the world.",
        "However undesirable much of this movement is, and its hijacking either by commercial interests or by the state is certainly to be deplored, it signifies the widespread recognition that memory loss is a pathology which attacks the very roots of our identity.",
        "There is a balancing act here, between, on the one hand, idealised versions of the past, and on the other complete loss of the particularity of cultural, economic and physical identity.1 Church has a long experience in this area, as the discussion of inculturation in mission demonstrates.",
        "As Lamin Sanneh argues, it has been part of the genius of the gospel to go into the vernacular in every place, thus stimulating local cultures, renewing them, and sowing seeds of revolution.2\u00ae Following Jeremiah it is essential for it to dwell, which is why, contrary to the desires of missionary bishops, churches have put up buildings everywhere, providing foci and facilities for the meeting and growth of local community.",
        "DIVERSITY At Pentecost the scattering which takes place at Babel is not reversed, but confirmed as a blessing.",
        "All the different languages, the roots of culture, do not blend in some ethereal Esperanto.",
        "On the contrary, they become mutually intelligible.",
        "The \u2018oneness\u2019 of the Church is, as Moltmann rightly insists, a unity in diversity.3 There is a promise of reconciliation precisely through the celebration of diversity.",
        "The same goes for the built environment.",
        "Thomas Sharp was right: a homogenised environment is a poor environment.",
        "A world composed primarily of suburbs, or edge cities, or mega cities, or a world which was just \u2018rurban\u2019, would be the poorer.",
        "Human beings thrive on difference.",
        "Discussions of \u2018cities of difference\u2019 tend to focus on the need to guarantee respect for different lifestyles, on finding space for the legitimacy of all groups.",
        "What this respect for difference has actually generated, however, is that postmodern eclecticism in which all true difference disappears.",
        "Until the mid twentieth century the difficulty of travel effectively guaranteed the persistence of difference.",
        "Ideas of course did travel: the arch went from ancient Greece, to the Muslim Near East, and then back to Europe, but over a period of more than a thousand years.",
        "Today, in a city like San Francisco where, as Harvey puts it, the minorities make up the majority, real difference is obscured \u2018through construction of images 1 G.",

        "Because we do not belong any longer to any place, to any culture, the extreme version of postmodernism imposes its codified code breaking logic anywhere something is built.\u201950 This architecture, writes Jeffrey Cook, amounts to the \u2018international trivialization of human life\u2019.51 Against that view there are those who argue that ordinary people symbolically mark their localities in inventive ways \u2018against the new rootless cultural imperialists\u2019, but this may underestimate the extent to which our buildings shape us.52 In the interests of the homeliness of the world common meanings have to honour the spiritualities, and therefore individualities, often millennia.",
        "Global meanings need to express themselves through local meanings.",
        "Malcolm Wells offers us an evaluation scale for our new buildings, charting their sustainability rating but also asking, finally, whether they are beautiful or destroy beauty.53 I wish to add the criterion of respect for indigenous cultures.",
        "This is not to advocate that we all live in tepees or igloos.",
        "It is to argue that the world is a far poorer place if we let the diversity of human exploration be swilled down the drain.",
        "Once again, Church experience of inculturation is important here.",
        "Though the British empire, in an acute loss of imagination, sought to generalise gothic everywhere as the image of what a church must be, there has never been one image, one heavenly archetype, of what a church building should look like.",
        "All local vernaculars have been assimilated to express the gospel.",

        "Max Weber famously appropriated a line of Schiller in speaking of the disenchantment of the world.",
        "For him this was on the whole a good thing, because it signified our freeing from fate, but good or bad there was no option but to bear it.",
        "Today, says Castells, \u2018[sjocieties are finally and truly disenchanted because all wonders are on line and can be combined into self constructed image worlds\u2019.1 In fact, however, the world remains an enchanted place, as reality has a habit of asserting itself over against virtuality, in both the difficulties and delights of relationships, in the immediacies of every kind of cultural experience, from the pub and caf\u00e9 to the theatre and concert hall, and in our encounter with both the natural world and many parts of the built environment.",
        "After romanticism the temptation is to think of enchantment as an aspect especially of the natural world, but there are many enchanting villages, towns, and cities, and houses and gardens too can be full of enchantment.",
        "By this I mean places which allure us with their beauty, which call us to a halt, which refresh us with their charm and are a positive ease and delight for the spirit.",
        "Christopher Day makes the creation of such places the aim of his architectural practice.",
        "The world\u2019s beauty has not, in fact, disappeared just as space exploration has not dimmed the beauty of the moon.",
        "This is not to say that enchantment can be taken for granted, as the recent struggle in Scotland to prevent chairlifts to the centre of the Cairngorm plateau, or the wrecking of Thailand\u2019s most beautiful beach in the interests of Hollywood, remind us.",
        "Gerard Manley Hopkins\u2019 protest that the world \u2018wears man\u2019s smudge and shares man\u2019s smell\u2019 has more cause now than when it was written, and we are called to be vigilant.",
        "But equally, as he goes on to say, And for all this, nature is never spent; There lives the dearest freshness deep down things; And though the last lights off the black West went Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs Because the Holy Ghost over the bent World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.2 ."
