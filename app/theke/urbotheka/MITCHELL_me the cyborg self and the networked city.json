    "content": "PROLOGUE To honor an approaching centenary, I embarked on an electronic pilgrimage. Like Ulysses setting sail for Ithaca, I looked to the heavens for guidance.1 I entered \"Marconi Station, Wellfleet, Massachusetts\u201d into my automobile navigation system. GPS satellites located me, software computed the quickest route, and synthetic voice commands conducted me to a sandy cliff on the shores of Cape Cod. The motorists whizzing past on Route 6, listening to their radios and casually chatting on their cellphones, didn\u2019t give it a thought, but it was on this windy site (most of which has now fallen into the ocean) that the wireless world began.2 Here, Guglielmo Marconi built four 210 foot towers, spun a spiderweb of wires in the sky, cranked up a kerosene engine to drive a 20,000 volt power supply, and ran a spark gap rotor that could be heard for miles. On 18 January 1903 (the year in which the Wright brothers were to introduce the world to powered flight), he transmitted a wireless telegraph message across the Atlantic. Suddenly the continents were connected in a new way. A century later, global wireless systems brought me to the spot and kept me effortlessly in touch as I stood there. In my hand I held an inexpensive transmitter and receiver that was immeasurably more sophisticated than Marconi\u2019s immense construction, and could instantly connect me to any one of hundreds of millions of similar devices scattered around the world. Furthermore, it could link me to the countless servers of the Internet and the Web. I pulled off the cover (no doubt voiding the warranty) to reveal a palm sized, precisely made architectural model; the powerhouse had shrunk to a matchbook scaled battery, the transmission house now resided on a chip, and the antenna tower was just a couple of inches long. It seemed that Brobdingnag had been rebooted as Lilliput\u2014producing a dramatic inversion. Where Marconi\u2019s human operators had been appendages to a motionless machine, the device that I now grasped was a liberating extension of my mobile body. SCALE The two parts of Marconi\u2019s system had evolved in opposite directions. The network had scaled up. The single wireless link had exploded into a dense, global web of wireless infrastructure; if you counted all of its terrestrial, satellite, and spacecraft linkages, it was now humankind\u2019s most extensive single construction. Simultaneously, though, the transmission and reception apparatus had dramatically scaled down; it had reduced from landscape element to fashion accessory. And this two sided transformation, I reflected, was not just a technological wonder; it had changed the way we lived. Over the course of a hundred years\u2014and particularly in the last couple of decades\u2014the convergence of increasingly capable wireless technology with expanding network infrastructure, miniaturized electronics, and proliferating digital information had radically refashioned the relationships of individuals to their constructed environments and to one another. I thought of the cellphone conversations that had continued until the very moment the World Trade Center towers collapsed, of the desperate calls from the cabins of hijacked airliners hurtling toward their targets, and of the pagers that had carried on transmitting from beneath the rubble.3 We had become inseparable from our increasingly capable electronic organs; our very limbs had become fleshy antenna supports; our interconnections had ramified and intensified to an almost incomprehensible degree. From prenatal imaging and heartbeat monitoring to posthumous persistence of our digital addresses and traces, our bodies now existed in a state of continuous electronic engagement with their surroundings. Thing to thing relationships had similarly mutated. Digital networks had begun as collections of large, expensive boxes connected by cheap wires. But over time the boxes got smaller, cheaper, and more numerous, while the wires remained much the same. Increasingly, then, it was the wiring of networks, not the boxes, that consumed space and cost money. With the extension of networks, telecommunications providers worried about the \"last mile\u201d of cable to homes and businesses, architects struggled to jam cable trays and wiring closets into buildings, cables snaggled across floors in unseemly tangles, and many things that might benefit from network connections never got them because it was just too difficult to run the wires. By the dawn of the twenty first century, though, inexpensive, ubiquitous wireless connections were linking whole new classes of things into networks\u2014 very tiny things, very numerous things, very isolated things, highly mobile things, things deeply embedded in other things, and things that were jammed into tight and inaccessible places. Most dramatically, wireless transponders that could identify physical objects had shrunk to the size of a pinhead and the cost of a few cents, and billions of them were being produced and deployed. Now, nothing need be without processing power, and nothing need be left unlinked. The distinction between computer hardware and more traditional sorts of hardware was rapidly fading. MATERIALITY The trial separation of bits and atoms is now over. In the early days of the digital revolution it seemed useful to pry these elementary units of materiality and information apart. The virtual and the physical were imagined as separate realms\u2014cyberspace and meatspace, as William Gibson\u2019s insouciantly in your face formulation put it. This seemed a welcome release from the stubborn constraints of tangibility\u2014 until the dot com bubble burst, at least. Now, though, the boundary between them is dissolving. Networked intelligence is being embedded everywhere, in every kind of physical system\u2014both natural and artificial. Routinely, events in cyberspace are being reflected in physical space, and vice versa.4 Electronic commerce is not, as it turns out, the replacement of bricks and mortar by servers and telecommunications, but the sophisticated integration of digital networks with physical supply chains. Increasingly, we are living our lives at the points where electronic information flows, mobile bodies, and physical places intersect in particularly useful and engaging ways. These points are becoming the occasions for a characteristic new architecture of the twenty first century. The metaphor of \u201cvirtuality\u201d seemed a powerful one as we first struggled to understand the implications of digital information, but it has long outlived its usefulness. Bits don\u2019t just sit out there in cyberspace, to be visited occasionally like pictures in a gallery or poked at through a \u201cwindow\u201d (telling metaphor). It makes more sense to recognize that invisible, intangible, electromagnetically encoded information establishes new types of relationships among physical events occurring in physical places. A bit is indeed a \u201cdifference that makes a difference,\u201d but we should think of that difference as something concrete, with definite spatial and temporal coordinates\u2014such as the opening or closing of some particular switch, door, or floodgate, the dispatch of a product from a warehouse, the starting or stopping of a motor, the change in color of a pixel on a screen somewhere, or the shift in position of a robot arm\u2014rather than a change in value of an abstract variable or an alteration in the imagined mental state of some idealized message recipient. Bits organized into code now constitute the most powerful means we have for expressing intentions and translating them into actions. INTENTIONS Conceived of in this tangible and architectural fashion, code makes it possible to specify the relationships between physical causes and effects in terms of symbolically expressed mathematical functions, rather than by constructing specialized mechanical linkages or hydraulic systems, hardwired electrical circuits, and the like. Through wired and wireless telecommunication, code makes these relationships effective at a distance. Through its capacity to store instructions and data, code allows predefined relationships to manifest themselves asynchronously. Through the increasing integration of telecommunication networks and digital controls with vehicles and transportation networks, electrical supply systems, water, gas, and petroleum pipeline systems, dams and flood control systems, air conditioning systems, and global trading systems, digital code now controls the supply of just about everything that\u2019s essential to us. Code is weaving an ever denser web of complex, inescapable interconnections across space and time. And this is just the beginning; the curve of technological development is snapping into the steep part. But there are bad bits as well as good ones. Ill intended zeros and ones can serve as weapons as surely as bullets. In a networked, electronically interconnected world, there is no fundamental distinction between addresses and targets. My conventional mail address makes me a potential target for junk mail, anthrax spores, and letter bombs, dispatched from just about anywhere. Similarly, my electronic mail address attracts viruses, worms, and spam\u2014of even less determinate origin. The coordinates propagated by my wireless devices invite electronic tracking and surveillance. The technology that so precisely guides my automobile to a specified urban location can also guide a missile or a smart bomb. And increasingly, the containers that now speed through the links we have so carefully constructed\u2014from packets on the Internet to the cabins of jetliners\u2014are not only subject to physical hijacking but also to electronic hacking, militarization, reengineering, reprogramming, and being recombined, redirected, and turned against us. ETHICS In the following pages I shall examine the interwoven implications of wireless linkage, ubiquitous and global scale interconnection, miniaturization and portability, mobilized bits, and associated systems and practices for our bodies, our clothing, our architecture, our cities, our patterns and systems of movement, and our uses of space and time. In particular, I shall consider a crucial consequence of these technological transformations\u2014the shift from a world structured by boundaries and enclosures to a world increasingly dominated, at every scale, by connections, networks, and flows. This is a world of less rigid, more fluid and flexible relationships\u2014of knowledge to action, of shape to materials, and of people to places. It is a world, I shall argue, in which networks propagate the effects of our actions far beyond traditional boundaries. Increasingly, we can do unto others at a distance, and they can do unto us. The widening circle of electronic interconnectivity and interdependence creates a widening moral circle. The principle of reciprocity\u2014the ancient Golden Rule\u2014is no longer circumscribed in space and time, and its expansion has profound consequences for design, engineering, and planning practice. My analysis of this condition gives priority neither to the autonomous logic of technological development nor to desire and power. Instead, I assume that we shape our technologies, then our technologies shape us, in ongoing cycles that produce our everyday physical and social environments. I write not from the perspective of a technological futurist who attempts to predict these cycles, nor that of an empirical social scientist who carefully observes them unfolding, but that of a critically engaged designer whose business it is to reflect, imagine, and invent. 1 boundaries/networks Consider, if you will, Me+ +. I consist of a biological core surrounded by extended, constructed systems of boundaries and networks. These boundary and network structures are topological and functional duals of each other.1 The boundaries define a space of containers and places (the traditional domain of architecture), while the networks establish a space of links and flows. Walls, fences, and skins divide; paths, pipes, and wires connect. BOUNDARIES My natural skin is just layer zero of a nested boundary structure. When I shave, I coat my face with lather. When I\u2019m nearly naked in the open air, I wear\u2014at the very least\u2014a second skin of spf 15 sunblock. My clothing is a layer of soft architecture, shrinkwrapped around the contours of my body. Beds, rugs, and curtains are looser assemblages of surrounding fabric\u2014somewhere between underwear and walls. My room is a sloughed off carapace, cast into a more rigorous geometry, fixed in place, and enlarged in scale so that it encloses me at a comfortable distance. The building that contains it has a weatherproof exterior shell. Before modern mobile artillery, fortified city walls would have provided a final, hardened, outermost crust; these sorts of urban scale skins remained reasonably effective at least until the 1871 siege of Paris, during the Franco Prussian War.2 In the early years of the Cold War, outer defensive encasements reemerged, in extreme form, as domestic nuclear bunkers. The destruction of the Berlin Wall in 1989 marked the end of that edgy era. But still, if I end up in jail, an internment camp, or a walled retirement community, the distinction between intramural and extramural remains brutally literal. If I retire to a farm, a boundary fence stops my stock from straying. And if I locate myself within the homeland of a major military power, I take refuge behind a dubious high tech bulwark that extends across thousands of kilometers; our extradermal armored layers have coevolved, with increasingly fearsome weapons systems, into invisible radar curtains and missile shields that create vast electronic enceintes. I surround myself with successive artificial skins that continually vary in number and character according to my changing needs and circumstances.3 All of my boundaries depend, for their effectiveness, upon combining sufficient capacity to attenuate flow with sufficient thickness. If I want to keep warm, for example, I can use a thin layer of highly insulating material or a thicker layer of a less effective insulator. If I want acoustic privacy, I can retreat behind a closed door, or I can simply rely on the attenuation of sound waves in air and move out of earshot. If I want to create a jail, I can construct escape proof walls, or I can remove the prisoners to a sufficiently distant place\u2014like the eighteenth century British convicts transported to Australia. In sparsely populated territories, distance creates many natural barriers, while in buildings and cities, efficient artificial barriers subdivide closely packed spaces. CONNECTIONS But I am, as Georg Simmel observed, a \u201cconnecting creature who must always separate and who cannot connect without separating.\u201d4 My enclosures are leaky. Crossing the various boundaries that surround me there are paths, pipes, wires, and other channels that spatially concentrate inflows and outflows of people, other living creatures, discrete goods, gases and fluids, energy, information, and money. I am inextricably entangled in the networks of my air, water, waste disposal, energy, transportation, and Internet service providers. To create and maintain differences between the interiors and exteriors of enclosures\u2014and there is no point to boundaries and enclo sures if there are no differences\u2014I seek to control these networked flows. So the crossing points are sites where I can survey what\u2019s coming and going, make access decisions, filter out what I don\u2019t want to admit or release, express desire, exercise power, and define otherness. Directly and indirectly, I employ doors, windows, bug screens, gates, cattle grids, adjustable apertures, valves, filters, prophylactics, diapers, face masks, receptionists, security checkpoints, customs and immigration checkpoints, traffic signals, routers and switches to determine who or what can go where, and when they can go there. So do you, of course, and so do others with the capacity to do so in particular contexts. Through the interaction of our efforts to effect and control transfers among enclosures and our competition for network resources, we mutually construct and constrain one another\u2019s realms of daily action. Within the relatively stable framework of our interconnecting, overlapping, sometimes shared transfer networks, our intricately interwoven demands and responses create fluctuating conditions of freedom and constraint. And as networks become faster, more pervasive, and more essential, these dynamics become increasingly crucial to the conduct of our lives; we have all discovered that a traffic jam, a checkin line, a power outage, a server overwhelmed by a denial of service attack, or a market crash can create as effective a barrier as a locked door. The more we depend upon networks, the more tightly and dynamically interwoven our destinies become. NETWORKS The archetypal structure of the network, with its accumulation and habitation sites, links, dynamic flow patterns, interdependencies, and control points, is now repeated at every scale from that of neural networks (neurons, axons, synapses) and digital circuitry (registers, electron pathways, switches) to that of global transportation networks (warehouses, shipping and air routes, ports of entry).5 And networks of different types and scales are integrated into larger network complexes serving multiple functions. Depending upon our relationships to the associated social and political structures, each of us can potentially play many different roles (some strong, some weak) at nodes within these complexes\u2014owner, authorized user, operator, occupant, occupier, tenant, customer, guest, sojourner, tourist, immigrant, alien, interloper, infiltrator, trespasser, snooper, besieger, cracker, hijacker, invader, gatekeeper, jailer, or prisoner. Power and political identity have become inseparable from these roles. With the proliferation of networks and our increasing dependence upon them, there has been a gradual inversion of the relationship between barriers and links. As the ancient use of a circle of walls to serve as the ideogram for a city illustrates, the enclosing, dividing, and sometimes defended boundary was once the decisive mechanism of political geography. Joshua got access the old fashioned way; when he blew his righteous trumpet, the walls of Jericho came tumbling down. By the mid twentieth century, though, the most memorable ideogram of London was its underground network, and that of Los Angeles was its freeway map; riding the networks, not dwelling within walls, was what made you a Londoner or an Angeleno. And the story of recent urban growth has not been one of successive encircling walls, as it mostly would have been for ancient, medieval, and Renaissance cities, but of network induced sprawl at the fringes. More recently, the unbelievably intricate diagram of Internet interconnectivity has become the most vivid icon of globalization. Now you get access by typing in your password, and IT managers dissolve the perimeters between organizations by merging their network access authorization lists. Today the network, rather than the enclosure, is emerging as the desired and contested object: the dual now dominates.6 Extension and entanglement trump enclosure and autonomy. Control of territory means little unless you also control the channel capacity and access points that service it. A year after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the implications of this were sinking in. The President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board bluntly reported (to nobody\u2019s very great surprise), Our economy and national security are fully dependent upon information technology and the information infrastructure. A network of networks directly supports the operation of all sectors of our economy\u2014energy (electric power, oil and gas), transportation (rail, air, merchant marine), finance and banking, information and telecom munications, public health, emergency services, water, chemical, defense industrial base, food, agriculture, and postal and shipping. The reach of these computer networks exceeds the bounds of cyberspace. They also control physical objects such as electrical transformers, trains, pipeline pumps, chemical vats, radars, and stock markets.7 Connectivity had become the defining characteristic of our twenty first century urban condition. CLOCKS All networks have their particular paces and rhythms. Within the nested layers and recursively embedded networks of my world, my pulse\u2014the sound of an intermediate scale, low speed vascular network\u2014has been mechanized, regularized, externalized, and endlessly echoed back to me. Just as boundary, flow, and control systems subdivide my space into specialized, manageable zones, these constructed rhythms partition my time into discrete, identifiable, assignable, sometimes chargeable chunks. Bean counters are also minute counters; measurable, accountable time is money. The miraculously monotone beat of the pendulum first established this possibility.8 Ancient sundials and water clocks had marked the flow of time, and Benedictine monastery bells had formalized its approximate mechanical subdivision. Clock towers had provided European towns with faster communal heartbeats\u2014essential, as Lewis Mumford pointed out, to the regulation and coordination of social and economic life, and eventually to the industrial organization of production.9 Then, in the seventeenth century, Christiaan Huygens devised a pendulum clock that ticked precisely. This innovation also initiated a shift in scale. Furniture sized towers (grandfather clocks, standing in domestic hallways) soon began to associate timekeeping with the dwelling and the family rather than with the town and the larger community. Substituting spring driven mechanisms for pendulums allowed clocks to become even smaller, more portable, and eventually wearable\u2014now associating timekeeping with the individual.10 Timepieces moved to pockets, then to wrists\u2014provocatively, the organic pulse\u2019s most obvious point of presence. Clinging tightly to flesh, they have enabled the large scale scheduling and coordination of individual activities; during the American Civil War, for example, the Union forces depended upon them to synchronize operations. As artificial pulse rates have accelerated, timekeeping mechanisms have continued to shrink. Today, the gigahertz, crystal oscillator hearts of tiny computer chips are embedded everywhere. (Chips without clocks are possible, and may turn out to have some important advantages, but they are not yet in widespread use.)11 Electronic vibrations subdivide seconds into billions of parts, pace the execution of computational tasks, discipline our interactions with computational devices, calibrate GPS navigation systems, regulate power distribution and telephone systems, measure and commodify both human and machine work, and precisely construct the accelerating tempos and rhythms of the digital era\u2014coordinated, where necessary, by a central atomic clock.12 They not only mark time, they trigger the execution of instructions and programs. Seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds: the electronic global heartbeat keeps quickening and gathering power\u2014so much so that, when its coordinated microrhythms threatened to falter at Y2K, there was bug eyed panic in the technochattering classes.13 There was talk of \"spectacular explosions, nuclear meltdowns, power blackouts, toxic leaks, plane crashes, and bank failures.\u201d14 PROCESSES But there is, of course, more to the construction of time than the increasingly precise subdivision of the day. As clocks multiply and distribute themselves spatially, the relationships among them begin to matter. Different places may simply run on their own clocks, or their timekeeping systems may be standardized and synchronized. When there was little communication between spatially separated settlements, local time sufficed, and there was no need for such coordination, but linkage by long distance railroad and telegraph networks eventually made it imperative. In 1851 the Harvard College Observatory began to distribute clock ticks, by telegraph, to the railroad companies. As transportation and telecommunication capacities have increased, we have entered the era of globalized network time\u2014 of GMT, time zones, and sleep cycles decoupled from the solar day.15 Once, villagers rose with the roosters to work until sunset in nearby fields; now, jet lagged business travelers do their email at three a.m. in hotel rooms far from home. Computers have added additional layers of complexity to the construction of time. The first computers\u2014constructed according to the elegant principles of Turing and von Neumann\u2014were strictly sequential machines, executing one operation at a time; programming was a matter of specifying these operations in precise order. Everything was rigorously governed by clock increments and finite (though small) durations. But as interactive computing developed, a distinction emerged between tasks that could be performed in \"real\u201d time and those that could not. For example, computer animations of threedimensional environments could be computed and stored for later playback, or (as in today\u2019s video games) they could be computed and presented on the fly, with no perceptible time lag. In other words, if you take advantage of fast machines to compress processes, you can elide the distinction between simultaneity and sequence. \"Virtual reality\u201d would be impossible without this. The practice of timesharing has produced a further elision. If a processor is fast enough, it can be programmed to divide its time among multiple simultaneous processes\u2014providing the illusion that it is devoting itself exclusively to each one. In effect, a single, sequential processor divides itself into multiple \"virtual machines\u201d that seem to occupy the same space and time. The ancient, seemingly unproblematic concept of hic et nunc \u2014what\u2019s here and now\u2014begins to frazzle. As processors have become smaller and cheaper, and as they have been integrated into networks, it has become increasingly feasible to program parallel rather than strictly sequential processes; tasks are divided up among multiple processors, which simultaneously contribute to producing the desired result. It is even possible to imagine organizing the entire Internet as a parallel computation device.16 At this point\u2014particularly as network speeds approach the internal bus speeds of computers\u2014it no longer makes sense to think of a computer as a compact, discrete object, or to distinguish between computers and networks. Eventually, we will approach the physical speed limit, and its associated paradox; information cannot travel faster than light, so spatially distributed events that seem simultaneous from one node in a lightspeed network may seem sequential from another, and vice versa. The logical endpoint of this shift to networked parallelism is the emerging possibility of quantum computing\u2014in which every atom stores a bit, vast numbers of atomic scale processing elements are harnessed to execute computations at unprecedented speed, and the notoriously strange spatial and temporal logic of quantum mechanics (rather than the familiar logic of our everyday world) takes over.17 (It isn\u2019t easy to wrap your mind around the fact of quantum systems occupying several places at once, quantum bits registering 0 and 1 at the same time, and quantum computers performing large numbers of computations simultaneously.) And, maybe, the ultimate network will operate by the quantum magical means of quantum entanglement and teleportation of quantum states from one site to another.18 So we have gone from local habitation and mechanical subdivision of time to a far more dynamic, electronically based, network mediated, global system of sequencing and coordination. The early moderns measured out their lives in clock ticks (and sometimes, as Prufrock lamented, coffee spoons); now, our webs of extension and interconnection run on nanosecond paced machine cycles that are edging into the domain of quantum logic. The more we interrelate events and processes across space, the more simultaneity dominates succession; time no longer presents itself as one damn thing after another, but as a structure of multiple, parallel, sometimes cross connected and interwoven, spatially distributed processes that cascade around the world through networks. Once there was a time and a place for everything; today, things are increasingly smeared across multiple sites and moments in complex and often indeterminate ways. DISCONTINUITIES In the fast paced, digitally mediated world that we have constructed for ourselves, what exists between 0 and 1, a pixel and its neighbor, or a discrete time interval and the next? The answer, of course, is nothing\u2014profoundly nothing; there\u2019s no there there. The digital world is logically, spatially, and temporally discontinuous. Our networks are similarly discontinuous structures; they have well defined access points, and between these points things are in a kind of limbo. If you drop a letter into a mailbox, it disappears into the mail network until it shows up at the recipient\u2019s box, and if you send an email, it\u2019s just packets in the Internet cloud until it is reassembled upon receipt. Obviously it is possible, in principle, to precisely track things through networks, but in practice we rarely care about this. We experience networks at their interfaces, and only worry about the plumbing behind the interfaces when something goes wrong. If you transfer yourself through a network, you directly experience this limbo. It is, perhaps, most dramatic on intercontinental night flights. You have your headphones on, there is darkness all around, and there is no sensation of motion. The video monitor constructs a local reality, and occasionally interrupts it to display current times at origin and destination. It is best not to worry too much about how to set your watch right now, precisely where you are, or whose laws might apply to you. The discontinuities produced by networks result from the drive for efficiency, safety, and security. Engineers want to limit the number of access points and provide fast, uninterrupted transfers among these points. So you can drink from a stream anywhere along its length, but you can only access piped water at a faucet. You can pause wherever you want when you\u2019re strolling along a dirt track, but you must use stations for trains, entry and exit ramps for freeways, and airports for airline networks\u2014and your experience of the terrain between these points is very limited. You experience the architectural transitions between floors of a building when you climb the stairs, but you go into architectural limbo between the opening and closing of the doors when you use the elevator. HABITATS Decades ago, at the very dawn of the digital era, Charles Moore (the most thoughtful architect of emerging postmodernity) shrewdly understood what the simultaneous conditions of extension and discontinuity meant for our daily use of space; our habitats no longer consist of single or contiguous enclosures, but have become increasingly fragmented and dispersed. They are no longer bounded by walls, but by the reach of our networks. They are occupied by spatially dispersed organizations, ranging from multinational corporations and retail chains to terrorist networks. They are controlled and defended not at a continuous perimeter, but at separated and scattered access nodes. They are given order and meaning not by participation in strict spatial sequences and hierarchies, but by their global linkages. Our domains of knowledge and action cannot be defined as fixed neighborhoods, but must now be understood as dynamic, emergent, geographically and temporally fluctuating patterns of presence. In his influential essay \"Plug It In, Rameses,\u201d he observed: The most powerful and effective places that our forebears made for themselves, and left for us, exist in contiguous space. They work on an organized hierarchy of importances, first dividing what is inside from what is outside, then in some way arranging things in order of their importance, so that objects give order to a location, and location gives importance to objects, as at Peking, where an axis penetrates from outside through layer after layer of increasing importance (like the skins of an onion) to the seat of the emperor himself, or as in Hindu towns where caste determined location from clean to dirty along the flow of water which served everyone.... Our own places, however, like our lives, are not bound up in one contiguous space. Our order is not made in one discrete inside neatly separated from a hostile outside.... We have, as we all know, instant anywhere, as we enjoy our capacity to make immediate electronic contact with people anywhere on the face of the globe.... Our new places, that is, are given form with electronic, not visual glue.19 COMMUNITIES Sociologists would use more technical language to make much the same point as Moore\u2019s. They would say that I\u2014like most urbanites today\u2014get companionship, aid, support, and social control from a few strong social ties and many weak ones.20 These ties, which might manifest themselves, for example, as the entries in my cellphone and email directories, establish social networks. In the past, such networks would mostly have been maintained by face to face contact within a contiguous locality\u2014a compact, place based community.21 Today, they are maintained through a complex mix of local face to face interactions, travel, mail systems, synchronous electronic contact through telephones and video links, and asynchronous electronic contact through email and similar media.22 They are far less dense, and they extend around the world, coming to earth at multiple, scattered, and unstable locations.23 As Barry Wellman has crisply summarized, \"People in networked societies live and work in multiple sets of overlapping relationships, cycling among different networks. Many of the people and the related social networks they deal with are sparsely knit, or physically dispersed and do not know one another.\u201d24 In the years since Moore wrote, our physical habitats have grown more fragmented and dispersed as transportation networks have extended further and operated faster. Simultaneously, the electronic glue has grown much stronger; it now includes voice, video, and data channels, broadcast and point to point links, place to place and person to person communication, the fixed infrastructure of the bank ATM system, the sleek portable equipment of the corporate road warrior jetting between global cities, and the cheap phone card of the migrant worker. Wherever I currently happen to find myself, I can now discover many of the same channels on a nearby television, I can access the same bank account, and I can chat with the same people on my cellphone. I can download my email and send replies almost completely independently of location. And my online world, which once consisted of ephemeral and disconnected fragments, has become increasingly persistent, interconnected, and unified; it\u2019s there again, pretty much as I left it, whenever I log in again from a new location. The constants in my world are no longer provided by a contiguous home turf: increasingly, my sense of continuity and belonging derives from being electronically networked to the widely scattered people and places I care about. 2 CONNECTING CREATURES You can read Ulysses as Honey, I Shrunk the City. Dublin\u2019s buildings map to vital organs\u2014the newspaper to the lungs, the concert room to the ear, and so on\u2014while Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus circulate through the urban anatomy like sentient corpuscles, disclosing associated aspects of their biologically embodied consciousnesses at each successive location. Conversely, you can read Finnegans Wake as Attack of the Fifty Mile Man. The sleeping body of innkeeper/ city builder H. C. Earwicker (or HCE, Howth Castle and Environs, and Here Comes Everybody) becomes one with Dublin\u2019s civic geography; his head is \"the macroborg of Holdhard\u201d (the hill of Howth Head), he stretches to the scandalously tumescent \"microbirg of Pied de Poudre\u201d (the Powder Magazine in Phoenix Park), and Dubliners are to be found \"hopping round his middle like kippers on a griddle.\u201d Earwicker/Environs/Everybody\u2019s voice is the murmur of Dublin reflecting upon itself. Now the body/city metaphors have turned concrete and literal. Embedded within a vast structure of nested boundaries and ramifying networks, my muscular and skeletal, physiological, and nervous systems have been artificially augmented and expanded. My reach extends indefinitely and interacts with the similarly extended reaches of others to produce a global system of transfer, actuation, sensing, and control. My biological body meshes with the city; the city itself has become not only the domain of my networked cognitive system, but also\u2014and crucially\u2014the spatial and material embodiment of that system. LIMBS (EXTENDED) Extra muscle first came from animals; horses and riders had all terrain capability and great power to weight ratio. Walking sticks provided an early, rudimentary form of exoskeletal support. Introduction of some elementary mechanisms\u2014wheels, beams, and containers assembled to form carts, together with smoothly paved surfaces\u2014yielded powered vehicles and initiated the long symbiosis of vehicles, roads, and cities. The first roads were a primitive form of network infrastructure. Wheels were devices operating upon that infrastructure, and each was precisely adapted to the requirements of the other. This marked the beginning of a profoundly consequential coevolutionary process\u2014one in which devices, systems, vehicles, and buildings have adapted themselves to the affordances of available infrastructures, while infrastructures have evolved and multiplied in response to growing demands. The hoof on the dirt track had extended, transformed, and amplified the actions of feet in the stirrups and hands on the reins. Eventually the tire on the road did the same\u2014via mechanical and electronic linkages\u2014for feet on the pedals and hands on the wheel. Through this sort of process, over the centuries, our limbs and muscles have continually extended and elaborated themselves.1 In the early industrial era, the steam engine and the horseless carriage substituted machine power for animal muscle. At first, machine power could be transmitted only over short distances, by means of mechanical linkages such as the drive trains of automobiles and the belt systems of early mills, but the combination of electrical generators, transmission systems, and motors allowed cities to equip themselves with extensive, efficient power distribution networks.2 And as power grids have extended and linked with one another, power sources have increasingly distanced themselves from sites of consumption; Hoover Dam (near Las Vegas) exports most of its hydroelectric power output to southern California, and Hydro Quebec supplies much of eastern North America. The electric power that is essential to modern cities has become a dynamically priced, computer controlled commodity that is switched around through vast networks as fluctuations in supply and demand require\u2014and as energy traders determine. Through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, by a process of exuberant invention, mechanization increasingly took command.3 Today, as a privileged postmodern urbanite, I can take advantage of the resulting vast accumulation of mechanical devices to precisely apply machine power wherever and whenever I may need it, with instruments ranging in size from microscopic actuators to hand tools, appliances, vehicles, elevators and escalators, cranes, and conveyor belts, to huge industrial plants. If I operate a telerobot over the Internet, I can extend my grasp and manipulative capacity by thousands of miles. If I have the skills, I can perform telerobotic surgery on a patient on the far side of an ocean.4 I can even tend a distant garden electronically.5 Where a sword might once have lengthened and hardened my hand as a weapon, I could now (as every competent terrorist knows) remotely detonate a bomb simply by attaching a cellphone to it.6 But that is just the informal violence sector\u2019s ad hoc alternative to putting flesh directly on the line. The vast weapon systems of twenty first century military organizations are fiendishly extended, multiplied, and strengthened versions of the ancient soldier\u2019s legs (which have become military vehicles and delivery systems), sword hand for offense, shield hand for defense, and eyes and ears for intelligence gathering. Since wireless remote control replaced the direct grip of the hand on the weapon, and since cybernetic mechanisms were introduced to control weapon systems more precisely, electronics, software, and robotic mechanisms have increasingly taken over the action.7 If I serve as an up to date military functionary, I am simply (in Norbert Wiener\u2019s prescient words) \"coupled into the fire control system and acting as an essential part of it.\u201d I become a squishy control node in an extensive and highly integrated machine network.8 And this condition is generalizing from fire control to choreography of the machines that pervade our daily life. By programming robotic devices I can precisely specify their future actions. I can instruct them to repeat the same actions indefinitely, to take action at a specified moment (as when a virus wakes up at midnight on a given date and wipes out your hard disk), and to respond to different conditions in different ways. And by copying programs and distributing them to multiple devices, I can repeat the same choreography at different locations. Through electronic storage and distribution of my encoded commands\u2014particularly by means of digital networks\u2014I can indefinitely multiply and distribute my points of physical agency through space and time. FLOWS (CHANNELED) Water supply and sewer networks have become geographic extensions of my alimentary canal, my respiratory system, and associated organic plumbing. The carbon based systems that circulate solids, fluids, and gases within my bag of skin are connected to a vast, external, mostly metallic and plastic network of pipes, ducts, pumps, processing plants, and mechanical transportation devices for food, water, conditioned air, and waste disposal.9 These extended networks collect resources in distant and dispersed catchment zones, concentrate them at storage nodes, transfer them to consumption nodes, and eventually disperse waste to disposal zones. They enable me to extend my ecological footprint (that is, the land area required to support me and assimilate my waste products) far beyond the scale that was possible before the development of extended plumbing networks\u2014and, indeed, far beyond the point of prudence. Under the standard arrangement, extended plumbing systems link me into the planet\u2019s natural air flow systems, water systems, and food webs, but their outputs may also be connected back to their inputs to produce miniature, closed ecosystems\u2014a principle followed (with mixed success) in Arizona\u2019s Biosphere and in NASA projects for interplanetary spacecraft.10 Increasingly, the flows that they channel are monitored by sensors, precisely controlled by valves and switches, filtered and tempered in a multitude of ways, and managed by sophisticated digital systems. One way or another, the pipes form linkages between small scale metabolic processes within my skin and larger scale processes outside it. My sexual plumbing is constructed to interface with other, compatible sexual plumbing for the efficient transfer of genetic information in fluid format. Unfortunately, the fleshware connection can be flaky, unstable, and nonstandard (worse than a dial up modem), but there are numerous illustrated manuals describing recommended configurations and protocols. I am a node in a body to body network that, sadly, turns out to be effectively organized for virus propagation as well.11 Traditional forms of sexual union are circuit switched and synchronous, with all the intensity and risk that this entails, but refrigerated sperm banks now function as genetic code servers. In vitro fertilization is an asynchronous transaction\u2014the organic equivalent of downloading email, and about as arousing. Blood donations, banks, and transfusions form a similar fluid interchange network; early attempts at transfusion involved synchronous artery to vein links, but if I make a blood donation today, I upload to a blood bank and some anonymous recipient later downloads.12 From the perspective of our genes and viruses, our bodies and their in vitro extensions are just temporary nodes in an evolving propagation network. In the extravehicular mobility units (EMUs) worn by the Apollo astronauts, internal and external plumbing systems were locked in a tight, semi permanent, crypto sexual embrace. NASA diagrams show backpack primary life support systems (PLSSs), with supply and removal systems, intimately plugged into the bodies of the moon walkers, and controlled from chest mounted consoles.13 The necessary interfaces were maintained by a maximum absorbtion garment (MAG) to collect urine, a liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVIG) to remove excess body heat, an EMU electrical harness (EEH) to provide communication and bioinstrument connections, a communications carrier assembly (CCA) for microphones and earphones, an in suit drink bag (IDB), and a polycarbonate helmet with oxygen supply and carbon dioxide purge valve. If you had the right stuff, you not only walked on the moon, you got to sleep with your extrabiological body double\u2014snugly beneath two layers of inner cooling garment, two layers of pressure garment, eight layers of thermal micrometeoroid protection garment, and the outer cover. In everyday life, of course, the linkages are a bit looser. Unless I find myself on extracorporeal life support I am only intermittently plugged in.14 But (in developed urban environments, at least) the interface points\u2014water faucets, supply and return air registers, domestic refrigerators, baths, sinks, and showers, garbage disposal units, gasoline pumps, urinals, and flush toilets\u2014are never far away. The preindustrial equivalents of these points, such as the well and outhouse, or the seats of ease on a sailing ship, were generally less pleasant and sophisticated, and were kept at a distance, but their modern descendants have moved indoors to become standard, indispensable organs of buildings.15 The large scale construction of these intestinal extranets and the integration of their interfaces into architecture were among the heroic projects of early modernism; they were conceived (though many are now more skeptical) as progressive enterprises bringing hygiene, equality, and cohesiveness to the industrial city.16 Eventually, as Ulysses obsessively emphasizes, there was no difference between shitting on a Dublin cuckstool and defecating in a London toilet. And the sewers poisoned the oysters just the same. By the 1960s, the architectural avant garde had begun to take note of all this. It was sensing a shift from composition of space and structure\u2014the conception of architecture that had been expressed by Laugier\u2019s conspicuously unserviced \"primitive hut\u201d\u2014to the construction of these pipe, duct, wire, and mechanical movement networks. (That was, of course, where the money was now going in most buildings.) Archigram in Britain, Superstudio in Italy, Francois Dallegret in Canada, and others produced endless images of human bodies\u2014mostly young, photogenic, and minimally though fashionably clothed\u2014surrounded by elegant plumbing and ductwork, large scale mechanical contraptions, and places to connect to systems that supposedly would supply whatever you wanted on demand.17 Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers built the Pompidou Center in Paris, with its ductwork and mechanical systems boldly exposed, Reyner Banham engagingly supplied some theory, and the imagery eventually made it to the movies in Brazil. In retrospect, it is easy to see that this (mostly) cheerily optimistic brand of technofetishism got half the story right; networks were, indeed, increasingly crucial.18 What it missed\u2014 dooming its brightly colored, hard edged images of Capsule Homes, Plug in Cities, Instant Cities, Cushicles, Suitaloons, Manzaks, Rokplugs and Logplugs to seem closer, now, to Jules Verne than to William Gibson or Neal Stephenson\u2014was the emerging role of hyperminiaturization, wirelessness, digitization, and dematerialization. SENSORIUM (AUGMENTED) Telephones, as the remaining McLuhanistas keep assuring us, are interfaces to yet another network infrastructure\u2014one that that now stretches my speech production and reception system around the globe and multiplies its points of presence. It didn\u2019t seem quite that way at first, since the earliest models were large, heavy devices attached to walls and sometimes enclosed within celebratory booths\u2014electrically powered descendants of the huge, earlike \"listening systems\u201d that Athanasius Kircher proposed to install in seventeenth century palace walls.19 They were components of buildings, and they established place to place networks. You were never quite sure who would pick up at the other end, and the relationship to our bodies was neither continuous nor intimate. But later versions of the telephone were smaller and lighter, and they plugged into modular outlets; you could walk around with them, and the coordinates of the connection points became fuzzier. Handsets were scaled and shaped to the human jawbone (from front teeth to socket near the ear) and resided on desktop cradles. Now cellphones fit in a pocket, they never leave us, and (in some cultures, at least) they are never switched off. They may even be wired into our clothing and equipped with earsets (scaled and shaped to the interior of the ear) for hands free use. They are more part of our bodies than part of the architecture.20 In much the same ways, my retinal receptors have been multiplied megafold by CCD arrays embedded in digital cameras, scanners, VCRs, Webcams, and videoconferencing systems.21 Some of these visual receptors are handheld, others are built into vehicles (from automobiles to imaging satellites), and yet others are installed within buildings. Some even operate through inconspicuous pinholes in walls. Some work independently, but increasingly many are hooked into the worldwide, digital storage and distribution network. With these pervasive audio and video sensing systems, the lines dividing electronic conversation, accidental overhearing, deliberate electronic eavesdropping, and systematic surveillance are thin ones\u2014 more a matter of context and intention than of technology. As wireless bandwidth increases, as the video equivalents of cellphones emerge, and as sound and image capture points proliferate, the balance is inexorably shifting toward surveillance.22 I am becoming the focal point of a global personal Panopticon. It is not a spoked building radiating from my body (that is, a network of one way sightlines), as constructed by Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Enlightenment imagination and elevated to iconic status by Michel Foucault, but a wildly ramifying circuit structure with artificial eyeballs at the ends of the wires.23 There are even tiny, battery operated wireless eyes that can be left anywhere and will transmit whatever they see to the nearest Internet reception point.24 There are wireless video camera pills (about the size of a vitamin E capsule) that transmit images of the small intestine to a data recorder worn on a belt.25 And as autonomous, nomadic eyes get even smaller, they will be mounted on remotely controlled micro robots or insects (most likely cockroaches) with electronic implants.26 Although audio and video sensors are most evident to us in our daily lives, electronic sensing is by no means limited to the acoustic and visual domains. Air conditioning systems depend upon temperature and humidity sensors. Vacuum cleaners and washing machines contain pressure sensors. Accelerometers, orientation detectors, inclination detectors, and vibration detectors can track motion. Strain gauges tell how a structure is behaving. Sensors for chemicals and biological agents provide the rough equivalents of our senses of taste and smell. In general, any self contained device that detects a property and produces a signal is a sensor that I can connect to a network and use to extend my powers of observation and surveillance. GAZE (UNRESTRICTED) I am both a surveying subject at the center of my electronic web and the object of multimodal electronic surveillance. All of those constructions of the gaze that the post Foucauldians have alerted us to\u2014 the gaze of desire, the gendered gaze, the consumer\u2019s gaze, the critical gaze, the reflexive gaze, and certainly the gaze of power\u2014are extended, reorganized, and reconstructed electronically. Re released Big Brother (or Big Other 2.0) is made from little pieces linked together; he/she is everywhere and all of us\u2014at least when we pay attention. And combating the unwanted gaze or audience is no longer a matter of proximity and enclosure\u2014of hushed voices, drawn veils, and retreating behind closed doors\u2014but of controlling access to networks, databases, and messages. Furthermore, the observer need no longer be an embodied subject hunkered homunculus like within an enclosure, like Kircher\u2019s palace courtier, Bentham\u2019s jailer, a camera obscura peeper, or the Wizard of Oz. Nor is it necessarily a bunch of bored guys peering at flickering video screens in a security command center\u2014the modernist imagination\u2019s icon of surveillance. It may be a dispersed observer swarm, as with cellphone equipped, celebrity spotting teenagers. Or, as in the U.S. National Security Agency\u2019s Echelon and Carnivore systems, the observing mechanism may be software that filters streams of audio, video, or text data to recognize and extract objects and events of interest.27 (A stream containing the words \"White House\u201d and \"attack\u201d is likely to attract attention.) Furthermore, as digital records accumulate on the Web and in other types of online databases, they may be sorted, searched, fused, and filtered in numerous ways; surveillance may be conducted both in real time and asynchronously. These strategies overcome the Orwellian Big Brother\u2019s very human limitation\u2014that he could only pay attention to a few things at a time. Since the shrinkage of microphones, video cameras, and other sensing devices makes them increasingly invisible, since it is usually impossible to tell what they are connected to anyway (particularly when they are wireless), and since surveillance software seldom snoozes, our mere knowledge of the widespread existence of surveillance apparatus establishes the presumption of invisible, anonymous, unverifiable observation. Such surveillance is, as Foucault put it, \"permanent in its effects, even if it is discontinuous in its action.\u201d We act as if we are observed, even when we may not actually be. That is harmless enough when invisible traffic cameras discourage me from speeding, and it can be reassuring if I know that I may need emergency assistance at any moment, but it is easy to imagine more sinister uses of this new, pervasive machinery of discipline and control. Although Foucault wrote before the digital revolution exploded, he knew in his bones what was coming; jails could morph from enclosures to networks, and in their characteristic postmodern form they could be larger and more totalizing than anything Bentham might have imagined. SPACE (DE PRIVATIZED) Under these conditions, the traditional distinctions between a city\u2019s public and private spaces are eroding. When Nolli made his famous map of Rome, the difference seemed straightforward; he could show the citywide network of public spaces (streets, piazzas, and the interiors of churches) in white, with all their details, while shading private spaces in anonymous gray. In our secular age, new Nolli style maps would, of course, depict the interiors of shops and malls rather than those of churches. They would also show zones of hypervisibility\u2014 public areas subject to video surveillance and maybe to the scrutiny of face recognition software that picks out putatively undesirable characters. Conversely, there would be zones of spatial aporia\u2014the discreetly anonymous, secure sites of the servers and telecommunications hubs that make everything work. I can also peer electronically from private spaces into public ones and from public spaces into otherwise private ones, creating scrambled and sometimes paradoxical civic conditions. Security cameras provide interior private spaces with one way views of public exteriors, while exterior displays occasionally reveal what\u2019s going on within a building\u2014often for the benefit of those who cannot be accommodated inside. Two way videoconferences can link public to public, connect private to private, or electronically mix public and private. New genres of electronic exhibitionism and voyeurism, such as dorm room Webcams and reality television shows, put private spaces on public display. The space of television broadcast studios is normally kept physically private (that is, closed to direct view and surrounded by strict security) while electronically presenting itself publicly. On the other hand, sports telecasts make stadiums recursively public; we can electronically watch audiences physically watching the game. Audio headsets can create private acoustic bubbles in the midst of public spaces, and video headsets can create even more dramatic disjunctions. Wireless video cameras, which are designed to transmit to nearby base stations, blur Nolli maps in particularly insidious ways. If I am in the neighborhood, I can, if I wish, intercept these transmissions and display them on my wireless laptop computer. As I move around the city, I can surreptitiously open wireless windows at will. The shift from naked eyeballs to networked video also changes the rules of public space layout. As the urban theorist Camillo Sitte observed, the winding streets and odd shaped plazas of medieval cities continually provided visual surprises\u2014not to mention opportunities for unexpected encounters and ambushes. But the streets of Haussmann\u2019s Paris and L\u2019Enfant\u2019s Washington slice through the urban fabric in long, radiating, straight lines; rather than surprises, they provide continuous views of distant monuments, and instead of allowing for easy ambush, they are designed for efficient military surveillance, deployment, lines of fire, and control. They are, in other words, scaled up panoptic diagrams. Now, though, these spatial moves are unnecessary; following September 11 and repeated terror alerts from the Justice Department, the Washington, D.C., Police Department began to install surveillance cameras in Metro stations, public schools, street intersections, shopping areas, and residential districts.28 The resulting video feeds were viewable both at stationary command centers and in squad cars. With a bit more wireless infrastructure, they would, no doubt, go directly to cellphones. For the cops, camera locations suddenly became more important than street geometry, and the scope of their gaze was disconnected from urban geography. If you have electronic sightlines, you no longer need baroque street networks. Steven Spielberg\u2019s 2002 film Minority Report vividly extrapolates this emerging condition.29 In his Washington of 2052, transportation systems do not flow along L\u2019Enfant\u2019s avenues, but employ flying machines that can swiftly go anywhere and automobiles that can drive up the sides of buildings. Electronic surveillance systems are installed in every doorway and are carried by tiny, spiderlike, heat sensing, wireless communicating robots that can squeeze through the cracks under doorways. Retina scans from these systems are electronically checked against databases to track the movements of citizens. And asynchronous surveillance is carried to a new level\u2014precrime extends it to the future as well as the past. Once, the natural condition of cities was opacity; architects created limited transparency by means of door and window openings, enfilades, open rooms, and public spaces. Today, the default condition is electronic transparency, and you have to work hard to produce limited zones of privacy.30 NERVOUS SYSTEM (DE LOCALIZED) My augmented nervous system, like that of the D.C. police, has immeasurably transcended the disposition of my flesh.31 It has extended itself electronically by means of copper wires, fiber optic cables, and wireless channels that connect my brain to electronic memory, processing points, sensors, and actuators distributed throughout the world and even in outer space.32 It has been expanded to sense\u2014where necessary\u2014not only visible light but also infrared, ultraviolet, and very low intensity light, to make visible the tiniest of objects, to capture sounds far outside the audible spectrum, and (through MEMS technology) to be acutely sensitive to odors, vibrations, accelerations, pressure and temperature variations, and just about anything else that may be of interest or importance to me. The firewall of my skin is crossed by electronic and electromechanical interfaces to my hands, eyes, and ears\u2014and occasionally to other organs as well. Some of these interfaces are permanently active, others are switched on and off as required. Some are deployed at fixed locations within my surrounding environment, some are portable, some are wearable, and some may take the form of miniaturized implants. And it does not stop there; we are on an accelerating curve. Contemplating the recently invented telegraph, Nathaniel Hawthorne began to imagine a worldwide system of artificial nerves, endlessly pulsing with electrical impulses.33 Views from the Apollo spacecraft taught us to see the entire globe\u2014a sparkling blue ball in the dark void\u2014as an object of comprehensive electronic surveillance. Today\u2019s commercial observation satellites, in the words of RAND analysts, \"promise to bolster global transparency by offering unprecedented access to accurate and timely information on important develop ments,\u201d34 and their military equivalents are even more capable. Sensors of all kinds are now becoming tiny, inexpensive, and network enabled, and they are increasingly being integrated into very large scale sensing systems. By 2001 a committee of the National Academy of Sciences could confidently suggest, \"Networks comprising thousands or millions of sensors could monitor the environment, the battlefield, or the factory floor; smart spaces containing hundreds of smart surfaces and intelligent appliances could provide access to computational resources.\u201d35 Oak Ridge National Laboratory was pitching Sensor Net, consisting of biological, radiological, and chemical weapons detectors mounted on cellphone towers.36 Meanwhile, William Gibson\u2019s fictional heroes inhabit a world in which neural extension is taken to the limit by dispensing with all the intermediate junk and just jacking brains directly into the global network. So my sensorium is no longer localized by the inexorable laws of visual occlusion and acoustic decay, the range of my exploring fingertips, and the wavelengths and scales to which evolution has tuned my original sensory equipment. It reaches to wherever there are sensors with network connections.37 My experience of places and events depends decreasingly upon positioning my eyeballs at precisely chosen locations (as Renaissance perspective implicitly insists) and increasingly upon electronic access to a globally dispersed, multimodal sensing and reporting system. And, as this system continually gets denser, the relevant metaphor is no longer that of the all seeing eye (as depicted, for example, on the U.S. dollar bill), but that of a continuous sensate skin. The earth itself is growing such a skin, the surfaces of buildings are beginning to evolve in that direction, and our clothing will eventually go the same way.38 The radical de localization of our interactions with places, things, and one another\u2014in space through electronic sensing and telecommunication and high speed travel, and in time through electronic and other forms of storage\u2014was identified by Anthony Giddens as one of the characterizing features of modernity.39 If we lived within the walls of a preliterate, ancient city, all of our interactions would be face to face and synchronous, conducted in places like the agora; but we now live at the nodes of networks that allow a great many of our interactions to be remote and asynchronous. With the continued shift from enclosures to networks, we have bolted beyond modernity\u2019s spatial and temporal extensions to a condition of global hyperconnectivity. CONTROL (DISTRIBUTED) When I move a cursor with a mouse, I execute simple actions manually and observe the results of those actions directly in front of my nose; the feedback loop that keeps me in control, and allows me to learn from what I\u2019m doing, operates at a scale of centimeters. When I use a television remote, I send commands electronically and get visual and audio feedback; I depend upon a direct line of sight and being within earshot, and the feedback loop operates at a scale of meters. It\u2019s the same when I operate my five year old\u2019s radio controlled toy racecar; I\u2019m in trouble if the vehicle disappears behind the couch and I lose the feedback loop. But it\u2019s different when I operate a video camera, telescope, or robot over the Internet; in this case, the feedback loop consists of bits flowing through a network, and it may be effective over thousands of kilometers. In many contexts, form follows feedback. It is now a commonplace of control theory that swarms of bees, schools of fish, and flocks of birds are held together by short range feedback loops. Slime mold cells follow pheromone gradients to aggregate, and to respond to global changes in their environment, at even smaller scale. These collectives are self organizing; they don\u2019t need leaders.40 Their spatial coherence and their complex, adaptive behaviors emerge from the capacities of simple agents to observe the movements of a few neighbors and to adjust their own movements accordingly. Swarms of SMS equipped urban teenagers are not very different\u2014except that the electronic feedback loops linking their actions extend beyond their line of sight, maybe for many kilometers.41 Kids who hang together by pinging their posses in this fashion may behave in coordinated, purposeful ways, but they only occasionally form compact, readily identifiable, directly observable physical groupings at particular locations. Most of the time, the groups are spatially dispersed and invisibly linked. It is harder (though often appropriate) to conceive of them as discrete \"things\u201d that somehow contain goals. Markets have gone the same way. They were once enclosed within well bounded physical places, such as market squares. Information about demands, prices, and wares on offer was visibly and audibly evident within those places, and circulated swiftly through word of mouth as well. The invisible hand operated at very close range. But when I purchase theater tickets through an online auction site, or trade stocks electronically, I participate in a spatially dispersed market that relies upon long distance feedback loops carried mostly through electronic linkages. It is an extended, distributed computational mechanism, structured by complex rules and integrating both humans and machines.42 It is certainly a real and important thing, but you cannot literally go to it or even point out its location; it does not have a stable, definite physical identity. Games have dispersed even more dramatically. A tennis or basketball court is a rigorously standardized piece of geography designed to contain the rule governed flow of action; an \"out of bounds\u201d condition is not to be taken lightly. The players observe the ball and one another directly, at close range, and they respond accordingly. When I participate in an online computer game, though, I don\u2019t have any idea where the physical boundaries are or how many active players there might currently be; I interact with the other players, avatar to avatar, in software generated, software ruled virtual terrain. (There may be trouble if the value of a variable inadvertently goes out of range, or if a stack overflows\u2014but that is another story.) In the online ur game Spacewar (circa 1961), the virtual terrain was a simple diagram, players were few, and feedback was crude and slow. By the days of Doom (which suddenly began to clog networks at the end of 1993) and Quake, the virtual terrain was in full color 3D, there were thousands of players, and you had to respond instantly to feedback in the form of fearsomely skinned, weapon wielding, animated warriors. By the turn of the millennium we were seeing massively multiplayer, persistent online worlds (Everquest, Ultima Online, Asheron\u2019s Call, and more). These often grew to be larger than the physical cities inhabited by their players, and they could exhibit complex social dynamics\u2014such as the spontaneous formation of combat clans. In the subgenre of online sports games, such as NFL 2K3, the action took place in careful simulations of famous arenas, using simulations of professional players as avatars; geographically scattered players could meet in online \"lobbies\u201d to form pickup teams. In more intellectually oriented online worlds, such as that of the Slashdot news and discussion community, the model was the seminar room rather than the gridiron, and there was less interest in visual simulation, but feedback mechanisms and self organization played a comparably crucial role.43 It isn\u2019t that such complex, feedback rich, self organizing systems don\u2019t have identifiable units and hierarchies. In fact, they usually do. But their units and hierarchies emerge from the dynamics of interaction; they are not predefined, like those of armies and corporations. When social scientists first embraced the concept of feedback, they often thought in terms of homeostasis\u2014of closed social groups regulated by negative feedback loops and seeking stable states, as a thermostat controlled heating system seeks a stable temperature: community as a blob of slime mold. But that is not the way it has worked out in the network era. With the electronic de localization of my interactions, the feedback loops that guide my actions and teach me about the world may operate at all ranges\u2014from millimeters to thousands of kilometers. They may be synchronous or asynchronous. They do not integrate me into a single, closed, stable community. Rather, they engage me (with varying degrees of commitment) with multiple, scattered, perhaps spatially indefinite, and maybe transitory social and economic structures.44 And they implicate me with innumerable, simultaneous, spatially overlaid patterns of self organization in complex, unstable geographies and choreographies of control. MIND (MULTIPLIED) My capacity for awareness, response, and agency within these structures is a variable. My local stock of neurons has (the neuroscientists gloomily assure me) been diminishing as I grow older, but the supply of silicon and software at my disposal has been growing rapidly. Consequently, the neural network inside my cranium outsources more and more mental functions. I don\u2019t do much mental arithmetic any more; calculators and computers take care of that. I don\u2019t rack my brain for half remembered facts; I look them up on the Web. I routinely exist in the condition that J. C. R. Licklider presciently identified, way back in 1960, as \"man computer symbiosis\u201d\u2014except that Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Ivan Sutherland, and other pioneers of interactive computing mostly had dialogue with desktop workstations in mind, whereas I now interact with sensate, intelligent, interconnected devices scattered throughout my environment.45 And increasingly I just don\u2019t think of this as computer interaction. I don\u2019t directly control all the functions of the machines and devices I use; I rely on the intermediating machine intelligence embedded in my cellphone, my car, my domestic appliances, the operating system of my laptop computer, and my software agents. Mostly I cannot tell whether such intelligence is supplied by local devices, by remote servers, or by some combination of the two, and it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014as long as there is capacity available somewhere, and the connections are sufficiently fast. Often I cannot even tell whether a verbal response I receive over the network has been generated by a person or by a machine; the Turing test has stealthily been aced.46 And when I\u2019m in a deathmatch on a first person shooter like Quake, an AI opponent such as ReaperBot may be more formidable than a human one. As nodes of machine intelligence are distributed just about everywhere, as electronic interconnectivity grows, and as electronic feedback loops multiply, cities are evolving into extended minds and biological brains are becoming elements of larger cognitive systems. It is Santa Cruz guru Gregory Bateson\u2019s \"ecology of mind,\u201d but with much more silicon and many more electronic interconnections than he ever imagined. Mary Catherine Bateson, looking back upon her father\u2019s intellectual legacy, has summarized his brilliantly insightful (if sometimes frustratingly fuzzy) formulations of this idea as follows: \"A mind can include nonliving elements as well as multiple organisms, may function for brief as well as extended periods, is not necessarily defined by a boundary such as an envelope of skin, and consciousness, if present at all, is always only partial.\u201d47 Bateson himself put it: \"Within Mind in the widest sense there will be a hierarchy of subsystems, any one of which we can call an individual mind.\u201d48 He went on to ask, \"But what about \u2018me\u2019 \u201d? And his answer was uncompromising: Suppose I am a blind man, and I use a stick. I go tap, tap, tap. Where do I start? Is my mental system bounded by the handle of the stick? Is it bounded by my skin? Does it start halfway up the stick? Does it start at the tip of the stick? But these are nonsense questions. The stick is a pathway along which transformations of difference are being transmitted. The way to delineate the system is to draw the limiting line in such a way that you do not cut any of these pathways in ways which leave things inexplicable. If what you are trying to explain is a given piece of behavior, such as the locomotion of the blind man, then, for this purpose, you will need the street, the stick, the man; the street, the stick, and so on, round and round.49 Similar spatial and functional extensions of mental systems are produced, in variously specialized ways, by the artist\u2019s pencil, the surgeon\u2019s scalpel, the diner\u2019s cutlery, the canoeist\u2019s oar, the fencer\u2019s sword, the tennis player\u2019s racquet, the boxer\u2019s glove, and the mother\u2019s Q tip in a baby\u2019s ear. With surfboards and skateboards, feet instead of hands are the crucial connection points. Cyclists, sailors, and hang glider pilots interact with their environments at more points and through more complex mechanical linkages. Automobile drivers and airplane pilots do so through powered mechanisms, and in more advanced vehicles through electronic connections, interface devices, sensors, and servos. For several decades now, computer network users have done so through indefinitely extended electronic systems with distributed intelligence, elaborate sensor and effector systems, and increasing capacity for autonomous agency. Today, through miniaturization and wireless interconnection, these networks are becoming denser and more pervasive. In all of these cases the extended body functions as a system for perceiving one\u2019s environment in particular ways, reasoning about it, and executing actions that engage it. It is not that there is a unified \"world brain\u201d of the sort rather crudely imagined by H. G. Wells in the 1930s.50 But skulls and skins do not bound mental systems, and through computer networking these systems can now extend indefinitely. MEMORY (EVOLVING) When such extended and distributed mental systems have the capacity to store and recall information, they don\u2019t just live in the present. They can learn from experience and grow smarter over time. Specialized memory organs may, of course, be enclosed within craniums, but they may also be inscribed on stone tablets or sheets of paper or implemented electronically in silicon or magnetic oxide. Extracranial memories once consisted of records clustered within easy reach, like the papers on my desktop or the notes and pictures on my refrigerator door, but they are evolving into global, selforganizing networks. One part of my artificially extended memory consists of the world\u2019s scholarly and scientific literature\u2014a collection of paper documents, most of which exist in multiple copies and locations, cross connected by citations. I access information in this form by physically tracking down particular pieces of paper. Another part consists of the World Wide Web, that is, of hyperlinked online documents that I access either by following links or by employing the indexes constructed by search engines. The two parts are increasingly interwoven; paper documents like this book reference Web pages, Web pages cite paper documents, and some documents exist simultaneously in paper and electronic form. Every day, millions of network nodes suck information into the growing online component of global memory, millions of users construct links, and as this whole, complex, hybrid network evolves, Brewster Kahle\u2019s Internet Archive grabs and stores snapshots.51 The larger this exponentially expanding, continually restructuring, networked, shared collector and memory becomes, the less escapes it.52 It can respond to major events instantly, automatically, and on a massive scale. When the attacks on New York and Washington took place on September 11, 2001, related bits immediately began to flow in\u2014not just from the immediate vicinities, but from around the world. There was an explosive accumulation of eyewitness footage and accounts, news reports and analyses, memorial sites, tribute pages, survivor registries, commentaries, and policy analyses. A year later, when the first books on the attacks were appearing, and discussions of an architectural memorial were just getting under way, the Internet Archive already had more than five terabytes of online, indexed data on the subject.53 (For comparison, the entire Library of Congress contains about twenty million books, or twenty terabytes of textual information.) So we can extend mental systems by putting memory and processor chips in things, networking them, linking them to sensors and actuators, and constructing feedback loops, but it isn\u2019t just a matter of that. If we take Bateson\u2019s view, there is no clear distinction between internal cognitive processes and external computational ones. Furthermore, as physicists are increasingly insisting, there is also no straightforward distinction between computational processes and physical processes in general; you can think of any physical process as the computation of some function. (Set things up in the right way, and the whole apparatus of bits, circuits, and symbolic computation might eventually turn out to be a cumbersome and unnecessary intermediary. It may just be the wrong level of abstraction for harvesting computational capacity on a really large scale.) At the speculative edge of this discourse, John Archibald Wheeler teases us to imagine \"it from bit,\u201d Stephen Wolfram conceives of unfolding reality as the enaction of an algorithm,54 and Seth Lloyd estimates the number of logical operations performed by the universe since the Big Bang.55 If every particle is an automaton communicating with its neighbors, physical reality at the subatomic scale is just one, inconceivably vast network. Opponents of artificial intelligence and skeptics about telepresence frequently argue that, without a body, an information processing system can learn and understand very little about its environment.56 They have a point; the isolated \"giant brains\u201d of the midcentury modernist imagination are insufficient. Hal doesn\u2019t hack it. But the necessary embodiment isn\u2019t just that of the naked newborn infant\u2014 though babies are on the right track. And it isn\u2019t just that of Adam, losing his innocence in a God given garden. We perceive, act, learn, and know through the mechanically, electronically, and otherwise extended bodies and memories that we construct and reconstruct for ourselves. And, as we are beginning to see, there is no clear limit to this extension. INDIVIDUALS (INDEFINITE) As Bateson had begun to realize, we are not fully contained within our skins; our extended networks and fragmented habitats make us spatially and temporally indefinite entities. His central insight was that the ancient distinctions between user and tool, building and inhabitant, or city and citizen, no longer serve us well. And at a practical design level, his point becomes ever more urgent as carbon/silicon interfaces get tighter, as networked silicon intelligence embeds itself everywhere, as EmNets (networked systems of embedded computers)57 replace stand alone boxes of electronics, as different types of networks are integrated into multifunctional systems, and as computer and cognitive scientists increasingly theorize \"societies of mind\u201d rather than discrete, unified intelligences.58 We will do better to take the unit of subjectivity, and of survival, to be the biological individual plus its extensions and interconnections. So I am not Vitruvian man, enclosed within a single perfect circle, looking out at the world from my personal perspective coordinates and, simultaneously, providing the measure of all things. Nor am I, as architectural phenomenologists would have it, an autonomous, self sufficient, biologically embodied subject encountering, objectifying, and responding to my immediate environment. I construct, and I am constructed, in a mutually recursive process that continually engages my fluid, permeable boundaries and my endlessly ramifying networks. I am a spatially extended cyborg. 3 WIRELESS BIPEDS As my networks extend ever outward, my circumscriptions multiply and expand like ripples in a pond. My cyborg self is structured\u2014 Linux like\u2014as a system of nested shells, with carefully articulated and controlled interconnections among the levels. Under my epidermis there is a tightly packed, carbon based kernel, mostly run by genetic code and my central nervous system but maybe augmented by implants. Then there is a wearable layer of cloth, leather, plastic, some metal, and a growing number of tiny machines and miniature electronic devices; to function as a coordinated system, these components need networking through my body or my clothing. When I travel in a vehicle, there is an additional, mostly metal layer, with its own increasingly sophisticated electronics, code structures, and interconnectivity. The architectural layers (which, of course, were Le Corbusier\u2019s idea of a machine a habiter) are generally composed of heavy materials, together with fixed in place machines and pipe, duct, and wire networks. Finally, the regional and global layers are formed by large scale, long distance infrastructure and geographically dispersed networks. MIGRATION OF FUNCTIONS Functions, and the artificial organs that provide them, may migrate back and forth among these layers as circumstances require. Consider protection and climate control, for example. If I need to keep warm, I can put on a sweater and rely upon body heat, or I can insulate the walls of my house and introduce a mechanical heating system. In the 1960s, Reyner Banham and Francois Dallegret dramatized this point in a famous project; their drawing showed them sitting, naked, in a transparent, plastic bubble that was inflated by the air conditioning apparatus in the center. Buckminster Fuller went further and proposed a giant, climate controlled, transparent dome over all of Manhattan. Marshall McLuhan hubristically trumped even that by suggesting that \"global thermostats could by pass those extensions of skin and body we call houses.\u201d1 For protection from the rain, I can use a portable umbrella or a permanent roof. If I worry about getting shot, I can bullet proof my vest or the windows of my car, or I can post guards to take away guns at the door. When I ride in an automobile I depend upon the airbag in the dashboard, but that does not work on a motorcycle, so the airbag goes in my protective clothing. If I participate in a street protest, I can build a barricade or march behind a mobile shield. If I am an astronaut, I can have my life support systems in a close fitting space suit or in the infrastructure of a space station. For protection against SARS, I can wear a face mask, try to live in a clean room, or attempt to throw a quarantine cordon around my city. Control points can also shift. In the days of simple mechanical controls, such as doorknobs and rack and pinion steering wheels, there was direct linkage of controlling device to controlled mechanism, and this severely limited spatial freedom. But the telegraph introduced the possibility of remote control; the motion of the transmission key induced corresponding motion in the reception device. Today, if I want to actuate some device I might find the switch on the wall, on the device itself (as with desk lamps and television sets), or on a handheld remote. And, as increasingly many devices get network connections and IP addresses, anything can potentially be controlled from just about anywhere. Less obviously, storage and processing nodes may migrate as well. My electric power supply may come from a button sized battery or a tiny generator in my shoe, from a larger battery or generator in my automobile, from photovoltaic or fuel cell generators in the building I occupy, or from an electric grid extending over a wide geographic region and incorporating many large power plants. The light I require to find my way may come from a ceiling fixture or a miner\u2019s helmet. If I am a scuba diver or spaceman, my oxygen is stored locally and circulated through wearable plumbing; if I am a motorist or airplane passenger, I rely upon an onboard air conditioning system; and if I inhabit a building, I depend upon natural air circulation from openings, upon a room air conditioner, or upon a central, ducted, air handling system. For my information supply and processing power, I may access digital memory and processing capability in a wearable or portable device, I may get what I need from a personal computer or local network server, or I may download from a distant server to a \"thin client.\u201d21 may fetch it directly from the supply point, or I may cache it at various intermediate storage locations for faster access. Even sensing functions may shift. The temperature in a room I inhabit might be regulated by a sensor on the wall or by one on my body. If I want a health monitoring system to know if I fall down, I might put motion detectors in the walls or accelerometers on my body. In early attempts to create intelligent environments, multiple sensors were connected to a single, central computer that processed inputs and responded; now it seems more effective to distribute processing power to the sensors themselves and to perform low level interpretation tasks locally. There is (as with many migrations) a strong sociopolitical dimension to all this. If you control temperature by adding and removing clothing layers, then you privilege autonomous individual choice, but if you go for Banham\u2019s plastic bubble, then you construct a situation in which the naked inhabitants have to negotiate with one another about the temperature setting. And Fuller probably did not consider the fact that the weather inside his Manhattan dome would become a matter of New York municipal politics. SCALE AND RANGE Scale matters. The independently moving subsystems that embed our biological bodies come in various sizes, and these sizes determine the potential locations of storage and processing sites\u2014in inner, intermediate, or outer layers. Somewhere, there is a distinction between mobile subnetworks associated with our bodies and surrounding, fixed in place infrastructure networks. The nomadic aborigines of the Australian desert represent one extreme.3 For them, almost everything is in the peripheral layers\u2014the natural infrastructure. They carry very little and wear almost nothing; this lightens and liberates the body, but it demands an extraordinary knowledge of the habitat, and a highly developed capacity to locate and exploit the water, food, shelter, and other resources that it offers. Nineteenth century European explorers of the desert\u2014equipped with camel loads of supplies\u2014did not have this capacity and frequently perished.4 Backpackers carry more than nomadic aborigines, but they still strictly limit themselves. They carefully calibrate their onboard storage capacity to provide themselves with sufficient independent means for survival between reconnection points. The bigger their pack, the greater their range, but they pay the penalty of increased effort and decreased agility.5 Horses with saddlebags provide greater range again, but have significantly diminished flexibility; there are more places they cannot go. Wheelchairs for the sick and elderly offer more limited freedom of movement, but can provide room for sophisticated mechanisms and electronics, medical supplies, and even intravenous drips. Mechanical transportation, providing the capacity to move larger packages of stuff around, shifts the balance still further. Compared to a horse, an automobile can accommodate many more storage and processing capabilities onboard, in inner layers, to create a larger and heavier zone of independence from surrounding resources and conditions. This is carried to extremes in SUVs with cupholders, limousines with bars, Winnebagos with kitchens and bathrooms, and dustbowl immigrants making for California in their overloaded jalopies. A modern jetliner is a flying restaurant and theater. A manned spacecraft, at roughly the scale of a house, carries everything it needs through the most hostile territory imaginable. An aircraft carrier is a slow moving, independent system at the scale and complexity of a city. Ron Herron, in the 1960s, gleefully crafted epater the old guys images of walking cities. At the extreme are self contained vehicles\u2014from Noah\u2019s ark to the starship Enterprise \u2014that must operate, for long periods, where there is no infrastructure to rely upon. The ships of seafaring explorers, such as James Cook, faced this condition. Cook\u2019s tiny vessel had to carry provisions for months at sea, along with antidotes for scurvy. Modern submarines are designed to operate for similar periods away from their bases. And spacecraft for Mars missions will need longterm, self contained, recycling life support systems\u2014designed in a particularly careful tradeoff of bulk and weight against capability and range. LOCATIONAL OPTIONS Given a particular scale and granularity of mobile cyborg systems, design decisions about where to locate storage and processing sites\u2014 in inner or outer layers, in the fixed infrastructure networks or the freely moving subnetworks\u2014respond to many factors. Designers must consider intensity, urgency, and predictability of need, bulk and weight of storage containers, network speed and capacity, continuity or discontinuity of network connection, frequency of reconnection and resupply points, quantity and perishability of the resource being delivered, security requirements, and ease of duplication. There may be a need to achieve aggregation benefits and scale economies by locating sites where there is plenty of room. And there may be a political agenda\u2014a desire to enhance individual autonomy by locating resources and functions in inner, personally managed layers, or conversely, to strengthen community by shifting them to outer, collectively managed layers. Water is heavy and bulky, for example, and we usually don\u2019t need it instantly, so (fashionable young joggers and gym rats aside) we only carry around water bottles when there is no other option. Instead, we organize extensive systems of reservoirs and tanks, and deliver to points distributed densely throughout buildings and urban environ ments.6 In many cultures, the activity of constructing, managing, and sustaining these systems has been a crucial focus of political activity and critical to social cohesion. Electric power, on the other hand, is now required continuously to drive wearable and portable electronic devices, so many of us find ourselves carrying several miniaturized batteries. That\u2019s fine if we just need milliwatts or watts for a low powered electronic device, but if we need kilowatts or megawatts for some big machine, we\u2019re probably stuck with a massive battery, a bulky generator, or a wire. Stored digital information is different again; ease of duplication makes it convenient to keep portable local copies of files when network speed is limited. But when it is of a variety that quickly becomes out of date, and when it can be transferred almost instantaneously through high bandwidth channels, it makes more sense to maintain it on central servers and deliver it where needed on demand. Or, as content delivery systems like that operated by Akamai have demonstrated, it may be efficient to duplicate and store content at numerous cache servers close to end users and use sophisticated optimization software to figure out the quickest delivery paths as requests are received from particular locations.7 If things you need frequently are too cumbersome to carry around, then you can sometimes rely upon grids of fixed access points. Thus public telephone boxes and booths were prominent features of many cities in pre cellphone days; you could find one quickly when you needed to make a call. Today, we increasingly rely upon private, portable handsets, and these public access points have greatly diminished in importance. Conversely, many students on college campuses would rather check their email at public access points than carry relatively bulky wireless laptop computers to do so. And toilet training accomplishes a liberating shift from continual reliance upon wearable diapers to occasional use of the fixed infrastructure. In general, if you make bigger moving boxes, you can carry around more stuff and mobilize more functions; you can pack more functionality into an SUV than a little two seater, and more still into a mobile home. But the overall effect of recent technological development has been to shift the dividing line between highly functional stationary boxes (architecture) and less functional movable boxes\u2014 that is, vehicles, portable devices, wearables, and implants.8 Miniaturization (particularly of electronic devices) allows designers to jam more functionality into small packages, and extensive networking reduces the distances between replenishment points. Weapons designers were among the first to realize this; many of the early efforts to miniaturize electronics were driven by the desire to replace human pilots with missile guidance systems for the long range delivery of destruction. In the early 1970s, Archigram\u2019s David Greene and Mike Barnard saw where miniaturization was leading more generally; they imagined the \"electric aborigine,\u201d speculated about \"the possible influence of miniaturized electric hardware on lifestyles,\u201d and proclaimed\u2014 a bit ahead of their time\u2014that \"people are walking architecture.\u201d9 This effect is most dramatically evident with artificial hearts and other organs. Once bulky bedside devices that kept users tightly attached to the nonwalking architecture at fixed locations, they migrated to backpacks and strap on harnesses, and have now, in some cases, become small enough to implant. Step by step, the bodies of formerly tethered, immobilized patients have been liberated. THE MISSING LINK Until recently, however, there was a critical missing link. Interconnections across network layers worked reasonably well from the global scale down to the walls, but then there was a gap. Our bodies temporarily lost connection to larger networks when they got up and moved around. Interim storage devices\u2014water bottles, rechargeable batteries, and chamber pots\u2014can expand the body\u2019s range from a fixed network connection point. (This only works within constraints of carrying capacity and expiration date.) So can flexible pipes and wires. A garden hose keeps you connected to the water supply system as you walk around your backyard, and a power cord keeps you connected to the electricity grid as you vacuum the floor. More dramatically, deep sea divers depend upon their air hoses. But you cannot remain tethered to an outlet as you walk city streets, drive an automobile, or pilot an airplane. And you cannot link satellites to ground stations with wires. In these contexts you must rely upon wireless connections. The possibility of continuous wireless linkage first emerged in the mid nineteenth century, when James Clerk Maxwell theorized the existence of electromagnetic disturbances that might serve such a purpose.10 By 1888 Heinrich Hertz had experimentally employed sparks to produce radio waves, and by the early 1890s William Crookes\u2014in a classic piece of futurology\u2014could speculate in the Fortnightly Review about a world of wireless intercommunication.11 At the turn of the century, through the pioneering work of Guglielmo Marconi and others, the telegraph finally became the wireless telegraph. Ships at sea were soon maintaining continuous telegraphic contact with shore stations, and by the 1920s police cars and taxis were getting primitive radio telephones for voice communication. In the mid 1940s, Bell Labs developed the idea of distributing low powered transmitters over wide areas and handing off calls among them to provide continuous mobile service to large numbers of users. This was the beginning of the cellular telephone, but commercial cellular systems were not deployed until the late 1970s. Since then, the growth of cellular systems has been explosive; by 1990 there were about eleven million cellular users worldwide, by 1995 the number of new mobile phone subscribers each year was beginning to exceed the number of new fixed telephone subscribers, and by the early 2000s the number of users was heading into the billions.12 Early cellular systems employed analog signals and were intended primarily to handle voice communications. By the early 2000s, systems were going digital and increasingly shifting their emphasis from providing continuous, person to person voice connections to handling bursts of chip to chip data. This generated interest in broadband wireless systems that could deliver data not just at rates of kilobits per second, but at megabits, or even hundreds of megabits per second\u2014as required, for example, by sophisticated multimedia.13 Eventually, the differences between voice and data wireless systems began, messily and haltingly, to disappear.14 We entered a world of GSM and G3 cellphone service, IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b15 local area networks (the \"wireless Internet\u201d), Bluetooth16 networks to replace the serial and USB cables that had interconnected adjacent electronic devices, and high speed UWB17 networks. In research laboratories, many other alternatives were being explored. There was no single wireless network, and there were competing and conflicting standards, but seamless, global, wireless interconnectivity now seemed within our grasp. The goal of a wireless transmitter is to provide satisfactory reception to suitable devices (either fixed or mobile) within some target area. This is essentially a matter of transmission antenna type and placement, signal strength, signal frequency, receiver design, the need to make efficient use of available spectrum, the requirement for sufficient spatial or temporal separation of signals that occupy the same parts of the spectrum, and policy governing spectrum use.18 It turns out that there is a complex logic of wireless coverage, and that this logic has motivated the construction of wireless infrastructure \"shells\u201d encircling the earth at successively greater altitudes, like the layers of a rather messy and incomplete onion. The coverage areas of wireless systems overlap with one another, and with domains established by geographic and political boundaries, to strengthen some established social and political groupings while subverting and weakening others. The smallest, lowest powered, shortest range systems communicate over distances of centimeters or meters. There is little need to regulate their use of spectrum, since they are not likely to create interference with other systems. They obviously aren\u2019t useful for person to person voice communication (your unaided voice probably carries further), but they provide a convenient, flexible way to interconnect tiny computing devices without physical networking\u2014an idea that has been explored in the MIT Media Laboratory\u2019s \"pushpin\u201d and \"paintable\u201d computer projects. And they can be organized to provide multihop connections over longer distances\u2014much as packets are routed from node to node through the Internet. At a slightly larger scale, Bluetooth enabled devices (which contain special microchips) can interconnect wirelessly on desktops or within rooms\u2014over distances up to about ten meters. Bluetooth was originally developed in the mid 1990s to link laptop computers to mobile phones. But it also now serves to interconnect numerous other types of consumer devices, such as MP3 players, digital cameras, printers, and video projectors, and to link portable devices to stationary network access points. Most interestingly, a Bluetooth device can establish instant connection to any other Bluetooth device that comes within range\u2014thus enabling, for example, ad hoc networking among laptops in a conference room or classroom. Essentially, Bluetooth and similar systems provide freedom of movement and flexibility of spatial arrangement within room sized socio technical systems. Bluetooth is not the only wireless technology suitable for this role, and it is likely that better alternatives will supplant it, but it has at least served to introduce short range wireless connectivity. At the next scale up, Wi Fi (802.11) and similar wireless base stations typically have ranges of 100 meters or so, but their signals are easily blocked by walls and other obstructions.19 Thus they are well suited to providing mobile coverage within private homes, businesses, cafes, gardens and parks, and so on. As these systems are deployed, our built environment is being populated, increasingly densely, with wireless points of presence that link low powered, miniaturized, portable devices to high speed, long distance networks. Base stations and portable devices provide personal mobility, while wiring in the walls provides indefinitely expandable capacity.20 Since these base station systems provide coverage at room and building scale, they tend to strengthen interconnections within established occupant communities. If they are open to visitors, they also extend a new form of hospitality. By providing free Internet access, they can add a new dimension to public space; Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park was one of the first public places to offer this amenity. And since the technology is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and uses unlicensed spectrum (in most places, anyway), it encourages grassroots neighborhood networking.21 With more powerful base stations, it is also well suited for municipal efforts by small towns and villages, electronically updating the communal role of the central church bell tower or the minaret; in 2002 the small Georgia town of Ellaville (population 1,700) pioneered this strategy by installing a broadband base station on its water tower, together with rooftop antennas, to provide Internet connectivity within a kilometer radius. The New Zealand city of Auckland deployed a larger scale, demonstration network throughout its central business district. However, there is a price to pay for this electronic conviviality; since signals do not stop precisely at walls, there are also dangers of overlap and interference between coverage areas, of unauthorized appropriation of base station capacity by neighbors or passersby, and of electronic eavesdropping. Outdoors, at city block and urban neighborhood scales, cellular infrastructure, which makes use of licensed spectrum and centralized switching, typically begins to take over. The infrastructure (particularly for advanced digital service) is costly, so it is typically deployed and controlled by telecommunications companies rather than by grassroots groups. Each base station in the system comprises a transmitter, a receiver, and a control unit, and is located roughly at the center of a cell. Coverage areas consist of mosaics of such cells. Cells may be about ten kilometers across, but they will be subdivided into smaller cells (with correspondingly lower powered transmitters) in areas of high usage. The base stations for the smallest microcells are found on lamp posts and other street furniture, those for larger cells are often mounted on small buildings and special towers, while those for the largest cells move to the tops of hills and skyscrapers. Since suitable base station locations are in limited supply, and since there are often competing cellular systems, there tends to be increasingly intense contention for cellular infrastructure sites. Although the infrastructure of cellular grids has traditionally been deployed at fixed locations, mobile \"cells on wheels\u201d may be used for rapid disaster recovery (these were much in evidence in Lower Manhattan in the days following the World Trade Center attacks), and there has been growing interest in the possibility of ad hoc, towerless cellular networks that are carried by mobile handsets\u2014and thus automatically follow users around and adjust for density. Naturally enough, cellular providers have tended to concentrate their infrastructure in high density urban areas, and along highly traveled transportation routes, where the payoff is greatest. In the developing world, and in sparsely populated areas, this has produced a pattern of urban wireless \"islands\u201d connected by long distance links. Occasionally, as with GrameenPhone\u2019s GSM cellular system in Bangladesh, an explicit commitment to the welfare of the rural poor has generated more even coverage.22 The next scale of wireless infrastructure is that of high powered, tower based, licensed transmitters providing coverage over distances of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of kilometers. This type of infrastructure began to emerge very early, with the first wireless telegraph towers\u2014which were thought of, for a while, as \"electromagnetic lighthouses.\u201d These were followed by the towers of early mobile radio telephone systems, such as those used by taxis and police cars. And chains of microwave transmitter/receiver towers have sometimes been employed (particularly in difficult terrain) as an alternative to long distance telecommunication cables. Socially and politically, though, a more interesting use of high powered, tower based infrastructure is for radio and television broadcasting to urban, regional, national, and even global audiences. Where the industrial era combination of machine powered presses with rapid transportation had created urban mass audiences that were reachable within hours, this type of infrastructure provides synchronous access to such audiences at very low cost. Since electromagnetic spectrum is a finite resource, there can only be a limited number of broadcasters in a given geographic area without interference, so this type of infrastructure tends to hegemony\u2014concentrating political power and cultural influence in the hands of those who control the towers.23 Consequently, governments have generally sought either to retain direct control of the transmission towers themselves or to license control to a few broadcasters.24 In general, the taller the transmission tower you control, and the more powerful its signal, the wider your broadcast coverage; thus the prominent towers that rise proudly from the tops of the tallest skyscrapers in cities like New York are not only instruments of broadcast dominance, they are visible announcements of it. When a high powered system is used for two way communications within some group that is scattered across a wide geographic area, different speakers take turns occupying the limited number of available channels (often just a single channel). Shared, structured use of a common resource in this way provides cohesion to communities as diverse as those of the shortwave School of the Air in the Australian outback, truckers chatting on their CB radios, taxi drivers and patrolling police officers going about their business, and Afghan fighters exchanging taunts via their walkie talkies. The commonly available spectrum acts as a social focus, much like the well in a traditional village. When Sputnik began to transmit signals back to earth in 1957, the possibility emerged of extremely high altitude transmission points, with correspondingly large \"footprints.\u201d By 1960 NASA had launched Echo 1\u2014a Mylar balloon satellite that could reflect signals back to earth. (This was a variant on the older idea of bouncing signals off the moon.) In July 1962, Telstar, the first active communication satellite, went aloft and carried the first live, transatlantic television transmission. Passage of the Communications Satellite Act by the U.S. Congress quickly followed, and COMSAT (Communications Satellite Corporation) was formed. Not coincidentally, Marshall McLuhan\u2019s phrase \"the global village\u201d began to resonate with the popular imagination. In the succeeding decades, the skies were gradually blanketed with satellites. Not far beyond the Earth\u2019s ionosphere, in orbit at distances between 500 and 2,000 kilometers, there are now low earth orbit (LEO) telecommunication satellite systems. Satellites in a LEO system contain transponders that receive uplinks from transmitters on the ground, converting them into downlinks to receivers on the ground or handing them off to other satellites. (A transponder is a device that receives a signal and transmits some sort of signal back.) The Iridium and Globalstar LEO systems were first put in place with great fanfare (maybe a bit prematurely) in the 1990s to extend the idea of a cellular network to the skies and to provide wireless voice and data systems with global coverage. So called Little LEO systems, such as Orbcomm, are designed for paging, tracking, and similar applications of small bursts of data. Big LEO systems, such as Globalstar, work at higher frequencies, support higher data rates, and can support voice and positioning services. In order to provide service at desired locations on the earth\u2019s surface, LEO systems must extend coverage to the entire earth\u2019s surface. Thus they are particularly important to isolated and sparsely populated areas that are not readily served by other types of infrastructure. Furthermore, there is likely to be considerable excess capacity in these areas\u2014capacity that might, at least in principle, be devoted to education and to supporting economic development. Further out, orbiting at 5,000 to 12,000 kilometers, are medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite systems, such as ICO. These operate much like LEO systems, but find a different balance of technical tradeoffs. They require fewer handoffs but higher powered signals, and they introduce longer delays due to the greater distances involved. Furthest out, at about 35,000 kilometers, are the geostationary telecommunications satellites. Unlike LEO and MEO satellites, they are stationary relative to the earth\u2014much like very tall transmission towers. They provide footprints covering very large areas of the earth\u2019s surface, which is very effective for television broadcasting but wasteful of spectrum (and therefore expensive) for point to point communications. They also introduce delays that are very noticeable in synchronous voice and video communication. Proposed by Arthur C. Clarke in 1945, the first of them (Intelsat 1) was launched in April 1965, and they have proliferated enormously since. They now cluster densely over the more populated parts of the earth, providing services such as voice communication, digital video (for example, via the DBS system), and Internet access through services such as DirectPC and Starband. Obviously there is competition among the various different types of satellite systems, and between satellite systems and terrestrial wireless systems.25 When a GEO satellite is in position, it provides instant coverage over a very wide area, with significant performance and capacity limitations. LEO satellite systems have very high initial costs, and take more time to deploy, but promise technical advantages. Terrestrial systems are relatively inexpensive and can be extended incrementally; if this happens rapidly while new satellite systems are being planned and deployed (as the planners of Iridium discovered, to their cost), much of the potential market for satellite service is lost. In the long run, satellite systems seem likely to occupy some important niches in wireless service (such as GPS, global paging, and service to sparsely populated rural areas), but not to provide a universal solution. From centimeter range micro wirelesses to broad coverage geostationary satellites, the wireless world is weaving around itself an increasingly dense, multilayered cocoon of antennas, network access points, relay points, and channels. Different types of physical channels are increasingly being integrated, through telecommunication standards and protocols, into vast, seamless systems of bewildering complexity. Every point on the surface of the earth is now part of the Hertzian landscape\u2014the product of innumerable transmissions and of the reflections and obstructions of those transmissions. The electromagnetic terrain that we have constructed, and continue to elaborate, consists of hotspots and deadspots, exposed areas and shielded areas, cells that get you through and overloaded cells that don\u2019t, signals (encoded in many different ways) that interfere with one another and signals that are cleverly multiplexed so that they don\u2019t interfere, jammed zones and Faraday cages, and the endless buzzes and bursts of electromagnetic noise.26 It is an intricate, invisible landscape\u2014 one that is hinted at by the presence of antennas (sometimes, as well, by symbols warchalked in the street to indicate hotspots),27 and can be made manifest by wardriving or warstrolling with a wireless laptop. This landscape frames a complex geopolitics and political economy of wireless coverage. Within it, at every scale, there is competition for access to communities, for antenna sites, for timeslots, and for channel capacity.28 Just as the kingdoms and empires of old struggled for control of terrestrial territory, those who seek power today increasingly contend for control of the airwaves. One geopolitical strategy, with its roots in earlier traditions of telephone and broadcast communications, is to treat spectrum like frontier land. Governments chop it up and sell it\u2014as in the spectrum auctions in many parts of the world that preceded introduction of G3 cellphone service. This facilitates comprehensive, top down planning. However, it concentrates responsibility for providing coverage in the hands of a few license holders, and it encourages the development of centralized networks in which everything must flow through a few major switching centers, which become increasingly overloaded as the numbers of users grow. And it often slows down the extension of service, since spectrum auctions saddle license holders with huge debts. A competing strategy, which draws upon the lessons of the Internet, is to think of spectrum as a communal resource, like the old village commons, or the land available to a squatter community. Anyone can use it, as long as they follow a few rules. This depends upon availability of unlicensed spectrum, and use of short range, maybe multihop wireless technologies. It is messier, makes provision of adequate security harder, and risks overexploitation by a few at the expense of the many, but it has some important attractions. It allows the decentralized, bottom up construction and interconnection of networks\u2014much as packet switching and TCP/IP enabled the explosive, bottom up formation of a global wired network. And it encourages a redundantly linked, decentralized network structure\u2014which means that the addition of channels can enhance capacity without overloading central nodes. There is, however, an additional twist. Since wireless spectrum is an immaterial, electronically managed resource, it can potentially (unlike land) be reallocated swiftly and automatically to meet changing demands. This opens up the possibility of dense wireless networks in which nodes cooperate dynamically to use available spectrum with maximum efficiency.29 It seems likely that this will be the key to future expansion of wireless networks in densely populated areas. At the extreme, deployment of wireless infrastructure can become a runaway, viral process. With very inexpensive wireless nodes, and a common standard such as 802.11, individuals can add nodes at will. With multihop technology, mobile and ad hoc wireless nodes can spontaneously form chains back to fixed infrastructure. And positive network externalities, supported by appropriate network architectures, can vigorously drive the expansion process; every node added to a network increases the value of existing nodes. There is a close parallel, in all this, with strategies for real estate development. Governments can allocate land in a few large chunks for master planned communities, or they can establish some general rules for land subdivision and development and encourage numerous smaller, independently initiated and controlled projects. Most often, in practice, urban form emerges from a complex combination of the two\u2014and that is likely to be the future of the Hertzian landscape as well. ELECTRONIC NOMADICITY Gradually emerging from the messy but irresistible extension of wireless coverage is the possibility of a radically reimagined, reconstructed, electronic form of nomadicity\u2014a form that is grounded not just in the terrain that nature gives us, but in sophisticated, well integrated wireless infrastructure, combined with other networks, and deployed on a global scale. Leonard Kleinrock (one of the pioneers of the Internet) has defined this infrastructure as \"the system support needed to provide a rich set of computing and communication capabilities and services to nomads as they move from place to place in a way that is transparent, integrated, convenient, and adaptive.\u201d30 This requires, as Kleinrock notes, \"independence of location, motion, computing platform, communication device, and communication bandwidth, along with general availability of access to remote files, systems, and services.\u201d The technical challenges of achieving this are significant, but they will gradually be worked out, and as they do, the social and cultural implications of electronic nomadicity will become increasingly evident.31 Other types of networks\u2014transportation, energy supply, water supply and waste disposal\u2014cannot operate wirelessly (or pipelessly), of course. But by providing efficient summoning and locating capabilities, wireless connectivity links our mobile bodies much more effectively to these more traditional resource systems. If you want transportation, for example, you can call a taxi or ambulance with your cellphone. If you want to know when the next bus is coming, you can look at a bus stop display that wirelessly tracks the vehicles in the system. If you want to find a nearby vacant parking space, a drinking fountain, or a public toilet that\u2019s open and salubrious, you will increasingly be able to do so with your portable wireless devices. If you discover a restaurant with a great special on the menu, you can call your friends. In these sorts of ways, wireless systems reduce search and uncertainty, and minimize the time required to get what we need. Furthermore, wireless interconnectivity mobilizes things as well as people. In wired networks, things such as desktop telephones and computers need to be physically plugged in to operate; they have relatively fixed and stable locations. But in wirelessly interconnected systems, components just need to be within range. If you add miniaturization and self configuration capability (just stick a component anywhere, and it works) to wireless interconnectivity, networked systems become fluid and amorphous.32 They are less like rigid things on boards or in boxes, less like buildings or cities, and more like the camps of nomads\u2014ready to move around and reconfigure, at a moment\u2019s notice, as required. The cumulative effect of these transformations is profound, and will become more so as wireless technology continues to develop and proliferate.33 Wireless connections of fixed infrastructure to wearable and portable electronic devices, and among miniaturized wireless devices, are now completing the long project of seamlessly integrating our mobile biological bodies with globally extended systems of nodes and linkages. As a result, functions that were once served by architecture, furniture, and fixed equipment are now shifting to implanted, wearable, and portable devices. And activities that once depended upon close proximity to sites of accumulation\u2014of water, food, raw materials, bank vaults, library books, or files of business information\u2014now rely increasingly upon mobile connectivity to geographically extended delivery networks. In an electronically nomadicized world I have become a twolegged terminal, an ambulatory IP address, maybe even a wireless router in an ad hoc mobile network. I am inscribed not within a single Vitruvian circle, but within radiating electromagnetic wavefronts. ACCESS RULES This new form of nomadicity is, of course, very different from that of ancient hunter gatherer bands, which were forced by the sparse distribution of food, water, and other resources to range over wide areas. For them, mobility was not only a necessity but also a developmental constraint. They were limited by what they could carry around with them. The very possibility of further economic, social, and cultural development depended upon sedentarization, the accumulation and protection of food surpluses, the consequent ability to support nonfood producing specialists at sites of accumulation, and increasingly specialized division of labor within densely populated cities.34 Today, large scale networks support division of labor and specialization on a global rather than a merely urban scale, the possibility of non food producing specialization depends upon network access, and that access is\u2014increasingly\u2014available ubiquitously and continuously. You can get whatever advantages you may seek from mobility\u2014wider intellectual and cultural horizons, global business opportunities, access to unique talents and resources, collaboration among geographically distributed specialists, the stimulus of diversity\u2014with far fewer of the traditional costs. Under these post sedentary conditions, access capabilities and privileges are more important than traditional forms of ownership and control of property.35 If you are sufficiently wealthy and privileged, for example, you can now travel very lightly\u2014with credit card and passport, some portable electronic equipment, and a carry on bag; you can take full advantage of the world\u2019s highly developed network infrastructure to access whatever you want, wherever you may need it. If you are a knowledge worker, a personal library of books accumulated in your study may now be less useful than mobile network access and acquisition of intellectual property rights to online information. The time honored way to invoke access privileges is to proffer a physical token that you carry in your pocket, such as a talisman, passport, metal key, or plastic card, so that a gatekeeping system can look for a match. With computer systems you proffer some bits that you carry in your head\u2014a password or PIN\u2014by explicitly typing or swiping. Now you can simply equip yourself with a wireless transponder that instantly, automatically, and unobtrusively supplies ID bits when interrogated by an electronic gatekeeping device. Thus automobiles with EZ Pass transponders can gain access to toll roads without waiting at tollbooths, and access to gasoline pumps through Exxon Mobil\u2019s Speedpass, which is based upon similar RFID (radio frequency identification) technology. With further miniaturization, RFID devices shrink to tags that are tiny enough to carry on key chains, to be sewn into clothing, or even to be implanted under the skin; wireless nomads can become continuously, automatically self identifying.36 You don\u2019t even have to stop to identify yourself; electronic devices can suck the RFID bits from your body or your vehicle as you pass by. From the viewpoint of service consumers, ubiquitous access capabilities and privileges assure you of getting what you want when and where you want it. From the marketer\u2019s perspective, that very same connectivity provides opportunities (subject to any privacy constraints that may be applied) to continuously track your behavior, draw inferences from it, and anticipate your needs. (Step up to buy a hamburger, and automatically have it your way.) Whenever and wherever you electronically invoke your access privileges, your action is likely to be recorded in a globally centralized database and, eventually, used as a data point in computing your creditworthiness and likely future consumption patterns, and in pinpoint marketing strategies. In other words, the post sedentary world represents the ultimate abstraction and mobilization of exchange capability\u2014and therefore, of wealth and power.37 In simple barter economies, wealth does you little good unless you have your accumulated goods nearby and can physically hand them over in exchange for other things you may want. Coins and banknotes emerged to serve as more abstract and mobile exchange tokens and supported the development of more complex and geographically extended systems of trade. Electronic telecommunication networks took abstraction and mobilization still further\u2014allowing wealth to become electronically manifest at Western Union offices, ATM machines, or credit card charge terminals at points of sale. Now, globally negotiable, electronic exchange tokens (which may be complex, metalevel abstractions such as mortgages, options, and derivatives as well as straightforward cash equivalents) can move wirelessly, and show up wherever a mobile device can get reception. Conversely, post sedentary space also redefines the condition of homelessness\u2014the plight of being placeless and marginalized in a sedentary society. Today, it isn\u2019t fundamentally a case of having no fixed abode. It\u2019s one of having no access privileges. If you cannot afford or obtain such privileges, if you get blacklisted, if you simply lose your cards or equipment, if you forget your passwords, if you have a RFID tagectomy, or even if your batteries just run out, you are\u2014like those clueless colonial explorers in the Australian desert\u2014surrounded by inaccessible abundance. NODULAR SUBJECTIVITY For good and ill, then, I am a not only a networked, spatially extended cyborg, but also a post sedentary one\u2014not because I have been bion ically rebuilt (apart from a couple of replacement teeth, I still rely upon my slightly worn original equipment), but because I am continuously connected, even when in motion.38 I am inseparable from my ever expanding, ever changing networks, but they do not tie me down. Not only are these networks essential to my physical survival, they also constitute and structure my channels of perception and agency\u2014my means of knowing and acting upon the world. They continuously and inescapably mediate my entire social, economic, and cultural existence. And they are as crucial to cognition as my neurons. Sometimes these extended flow systems demand that I disclose the identity of my mobile body, but at other times they introduce identity impedance. When I stop to pee into a urinal, I engage a gendered network node and thereby make a declaration of gender. When I pass through an airport security checkpoint or operate an ATM machine, I must declare my name and document my right to use it. If I carry a RFID tag or submit myself (maybe unknowingly) to biometric scrutiny, the labels that my body carries are observable. But if I wear a mask and gloves, identifying labels are obscured. And on the Internet, as has endlessly been remarked, nobody knows I\u2019m a__. As my body extends artificially from its fleshy core, its gender, race, and even species markers may fade.39 It may acquire multiple, sometimes contradictory aliases, masks, and veils. Its agents and avatars in particular contexts may be ambiguous or deceptive\u2014as when I choose an electronic skin to represent me in a videogame. Its very location may become indeterminate, and it may hide itself behind encryption schemes and proxy servers.40 We need more than McLuhanist extensionism, and certainly more than unregenerate dot com boosterism, to make sense of all this. It isn\u2019t simply that our sensors and effectors command more territory, that our webs of interconnectivity are larger and more dynamic, or that our cellphones and pagers are always with us; we are experiencing a fundamental shift in subjectivity.41 As Mark C. Taylor has succinctly summarized, \"In emerging network culture, subjectivity is nodular ... I am plugged into other objects and subjects in such a way that I become myself in and through them, even as they become themselves in and through me.\u201d42 I do not have a fixed identity, nor do I exist as a discrete individual. My spatial and temporal coordinates are diffuse and indefinite. My network extensions intersect and overlap with those of others. Humanist sages could complacently claim that the proper study of mankind was man. That ex cathedra confidence looks misplaced in a post whatever, ex net era; \"mankind\u201d and \"man\u201d are clapped out categories, and the idea of \"studying\u201d (in a study?) seems increasingly anachronistic. For networked scholars like me\u2014constructing texts on our wireless laptops, writing on the run, continually shifting and multiplying our geographic and electronic vantage points, carrying digital cameras, surfing the Web for our sources, tracing through networks of citations, cross references, and hyperlinks, sending out agents and spiders, poking around in the metadata, and attending to streams of email and instant messages as we go\u2014the pertinent preoccupation is the electronomadic cyborg.43 Many may mourn the passing of the (presumably pre TCP/IP, pre HTTP, pre RFID) liberal humanist subject and its celebrants. Heideggerians and other critics of modernism may kvetch about totalizing technology and the allegedly alienating qualities of the wireless cyborg condition. Students of gender, race, and political economy may remind us (quite properly) that we are not all networked to the same extent, in the same ways. Defense and security specialists may worry (quite understandably) about the increasing destructive potential of network crackers and hijackers. Those who just want a simpler life may choose to unplug, and to live off the grid in Idaho. But for this particular early twenty first century nodular subject, disconnection would be amputation. I am part of the networks, and the networks are part of me. I show up in the directories. I am visible to Google. I link, therefore I am. 4 DOWNSIZED DRY GOODS Even the humblest of everyday artifacts can suddenly gain utility, claim new roles, and form new spatial patterns when they are radically downsized or lightened. Ryszard Kapuscinski, for example, has pointed out the effect of the \"cheap, light, plastic container\u201d on African communities. Once, the women had to carry water in heavy clay or stone vessels on their heads. These vessels were valuable, so the women stood in line with them, for hours, at the spring. Now, plastic containers are light enough to be carried by children and inexpensive enough to be left in line while you find some shade or go off to perform other chores. Kapuscinski comments: \"What a relief this is for the exhausted African woman!... How much more time she now has for herself, for her household!\u201d1 Ironically, the affluent now also get their water in lightweight plastic containers\u2014with labels like Evian. In this case, lightening the container helps the distributor to bypass local water supply systems and to deliver a branded product from a great distance. From the consumer\u2019s viewpoint, lightness has a different value; it provides the product with portability, therefore adding to its appeal to travelers and recreationists. Lightness is what you make of it, in some particular context. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution\u2014and at an accelerating pace over the last few decades\u2014designers have exploited new technologies to make things smaller and lighter. As they have crossed certain dematerialization thresholds, many different types of machines that were parts of the architecture have become parts of our bodies. And this has been crucial in production of the new nomadicity. MINIATURIZED MACHINERY Consider, for example, music storage and playback devices. Pianolas required piano movers, and pianola rolls took up a lot of shelf space. Gramophones were still bulky, but sufficiently portable to make it to the front in World War I.2 Cassette tape players could go to the beach. The Walkman became wearable. And MP3 players have become smaller still, since they do not need to accommodate relatively bulky tapes or CDs. More and more music gets stuffed into smaller and smaller boxes. Once you might carry two or three tracks on your person; now you can carry thousands. The evolutionary path has led from heavy furniture to tabletop and desktop devices to handhelds and wearables. As architects and product designers know, there is usually some critical subsystem that controls the size of the whole thing; get rid of it, or find some effective way to shrink it, and you can reduce overall size and weight. In structural systems, as Buckminster Fuller tirelessly pointed out, the main problem is with the compression members; find a way to replace as many of these as possible with tension members, and you get a much lighter structure. With the Diskman the difficulty was the diameter of the CD; no matter what you did, you could not make the player smaller than that\u2014which meant you could not get it to fit in your pocket. Furthermore, there are relationships between scale and material. It seemed natural to enclose early gramophones in wooden cabinets and to treat them as a new species of varnished furniture. As tabletop stereos emerged, the wood became increasingly residual; metal and plastic took over. And you would not dream of trying to fabricate a portable Diskman case in wood; you cannot work wood sufficiently effectively at that scale, and it does not have the right mass and strength properties. Sometimes the miniaturization of devices motivates a shift to new materials, sometimes the emergence of new materials and associated fabrication technologies enables a wave of miniaturization, and sometimes it\u2019s a combination of the two. With cameras, the problem was film. The size of the negative controlled the dimensions of the optical system and the film transport mechanism. Shrinking film formats (and a move from glass to celluloid) accomplished a certain amount of miniaturization, but substitution of the CCD array, in digital cameras, decisively changed the rules of the game. Tiny, dense arrays allowed optical systems to shrink and completely eliminated the film transport mechanism. More subtly, substitution of electronic circuits for optical and mechanical means (particularly in the viewfinder system) changed the required connections and spatial relationships among camera parts and allowed them to be repackaged in denser and more compact ways. After a while, digital cameras were not only smaller than their predecessors, they did not look like cameras anymore\u2014just as horseless carriages had stopped looking like carriages. With laptop computers, you need a keyboard big enough to accommodate your fingers, fine motor skills, and a screen scaled to your visual field. Handhelds with palm sized screens and ridiculously tiny keyboards are an uncomfortable compromise. But if you can substitute a retinal scanning display that paints a high resolution image directly on the inside of your eyeball for the screen and a microphone hooked to a speech recognition system for the keyboard, you can shrink the whole thing to Rayban scale, and shift it from your knees to your nose. Substitution of electronic connection (either wired or wireless) for mechanical linkages, optical mechanisms, or flows of materials also allows products to fragment and recombine. Their functions can be redistributed, in new ways, over portable devices, tabletop appliances, and fixed equipment. If you want to shrink and lighten something, you can therefore do so by offloading functions to some other location. In photography, for example, exposures have traditionally been made by handheld devices, with developing and printing operations consigned to centralized darkroom installations, and storage functions handled by albums and archives. The Polaroid instant process repackaged exposure, development, and printing into handheld devices\u2014 providing convenience at the cost of bulk. But digital photography provides almost unlimited freedom to recombine. The exposure device can be reduced to a lens and CCD array with a network connection, and it may be handheld, clipped on to another device such as a PDA or cellphone, or fixed to a wall. Images may be stored in a portable device, a desktop device, or a network server. And printers may be located wherever there is a network connection. Sometimes, such recombinations open up new opportunities. Instant photography provided the possibility of discussing and evaluating images within the contexts in which they were produced rather than at later times and in different places. Similarly, the integration of digital cameras with cellphones provided callers with the opportunity to show what they were talking about instead of describing it verbally. MICROFABRICATION AND MEMS High resolution fabrication technology provides yet another way to downsize useful devices. This has been most dramatically demonstrated in the design and production of electronic circuits. The vacuum tubes used in early computer circuitry were, unavoidably, bulky and hot. The transistors that soon replaced them were smaller and cooler and could be packed much more densely. Then semiconductor technology put the explosive exponent into Moore\u2019s Law of silicon scaling. In the 1950s, portable radios with half a dozen transistors seemed miraculous; by the turn of the century, postage stamp sized computer chips with 100 million transistors were commonplace. Microfabrication typically begins with a macroscopic element, such as a wafer of silicon, and creates complex structures, such as integrated circuits, by precisely removing or depositing material. As the technology has advanced, the minimum dimensions of elements in these structures have shrunk from tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers. This progression will reach its limit when elements get down to a couple of nanometers\u2014the size of an atom\u2014but this is not the end of the technological line for microfabrication.3 As the race to this limit nears its end, emphasis is shifting to invention of new types of microscale structures and systems. Already, microfabrication techniques have been extended and generalized from electronic circuits to microfluidic systems with tiny channels, reservoirs, valves, and nozzles to replace the glass tubes and beakers of traditional chemistry laboratories, and thus allow analysis of much smaller samples. They have also been employed to produce waveguides for optical and radio signals. The name for such structures, microelectromechanical systems, is bigger than they are\u2014so it has mercifully been shortened to MEMS.4 More surprisingly, MEMS can have moving parts such as switches and valves, vibrating cantilevers, and tiny gears and mechanical linkages. This enables MEMS to function as sensors that transduce some aspect of the environment into electronic data. They can, for example, serve as pressure sensors, microphones, accelerometers, and angular rate sensors. They can be employed to detect visible and infrared light. And they can become \u201claboratories on a chip\u201d to detect chemical and biological agents. Conversely, MEMS can function as actuators that transduce information into useful physical, chemical, and biological effects. They can, for example, emit light or radio frequency (RF) signals, adjust microscopic mirrors to direct signals in fiberoptic systems, and serve as motors to propel microscopic vehicles and robots. In the early days of microfabrication, microchips usually served as the intelligence in macroscale devices. The personal computer of the 1980s defined the genre; it was a microchip, surrounded by a lot of other stuff that provided the power, and did the sensing and actuating, in a large box. Through the 1980s and 1990s, microchips were embedded in a widening array of macroscale systems, from household appliances to automobiles and aircraft. Now, as MEMS technology develops, the other stuff can often shrink as well. This is opening up new design possibilities. MEMS devices can function as insect sized autonomous systems within the human body, and in other contexts that demand extreme miniaturization. Batch fabricated, inexpensive MEMS can be scattered around like grains of wheat, painted onto surfaces, or mixed into materials like concrete. They can be arrayed to form intelligent skins that sense changes in their environments and respond appropriately. And they can intercommunicate and coordinate wirelessly to form systems with distributed intelligence. THE RISE OF NANOTECHNOLOGY Beyond micro there is nano\u2014the world of atom by atom or molecule by molecule construction of devices and systems with key dimensions measured in billionths of a meter. The idea goes back to a famously inspiring talk by Richard Feynman, in 1959, entitled \"There\u2019s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.\u201d5 In the late 1980s, K. Eric Drexler set off a new wave of interest with his speculative book Engines of Creation.6 Little more than a decade later, there was a heavily funded National Nanotechnology Initiative in the United States, and similar efforts in other parts of the world.7 Science and technology magazines were publishing regular\u2014sometimes breathless, sometimes critical\u2014overviews.8 And Michael Crichton, in his technothriller Prey, had seized upon the idea of nasty, self reproducing nanoparticle swarms as a new way to scare his readers.9 Not only are nanoscale widgets smaller than their microscale cousins, they also behave differently. Quantum physics kicks in. Atomic forces and chemical bonds dominate. Surface to volume ratios are large\u2014often yielding useful chemical and biological properties. Issues of strength and proportion, power to weight ratios, friction, heat dissipation, and durability and reliability tend to work out differently than they do at larger scales. You have to worry about tiny moving parts banging into relatively large air molecules. Down there at the bottom, designers must play by new rules. In 1981, the introduction of the scanning tunneling microscope opened up the possibility of imaging and manipulating single atoms on surfaces. Since then, nanotechnologists have employed a variety of scanning microscope techniques\u2014in particular, atomic force microscopy\u2014to push atoms around like Lego blocks. This provides a way to handcraft interesting nanostructures, but fabrication of such structures in useful quantities has turned out to require an eclectic mix of techniques drawn from physics, chemistry, materials science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and biology. At nanoscale, many of the traditional boundaries among these fields disappear. Where microfabrication depends upon top down imposition of patterns on material, nanoscale fabrication processes may work by bottom up self assembly. As in biological systems, structures are automatically built up from atomic and molecular scale units, then substructures are assembled into larger and more complex units, and so on. If you want to build very complex structures in this fashion, you have to find ways to minimize errors, and to correct errors automatically when they occur. At nanoscale, the possibilities of molecular electronics and quantum computation begin to open up. Nanoelectronic circuits might be built from molecular \"wires,\u201d10 or from quantum dots\u2014 wireless structures built up from electromagnetic \"boxes\u201d holding discrete numbers of electrons.11 Computer memories and displays might be constructed from carbon nanotubes.12 Complete \"computational particles\u201d\u2014working together as amorphous computing systems\u2014might become small enough to sprinkle like dust, float like pollen, or be injected into the bloodstream to serve as diagnostic devices.13 And chemical and biological sensors might assay single molecules. NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) might incorporate molecular moving parts. Already we see microscopic motors, gears, chains, pumps and accelerometers, bug sized robots, and coin sized turbines, and the Web has numerous picture galleries of designs for nanometer scale mechanisms. Nanoscale machines can even join the wireless world. It is now possible to attach a nanocrystal antenna to an individual DNA biomolecule, so that it can be controlled remotely by radio signals.14 It can twitch reversibly on command\u2014to function, for example, as a tiny actuator or switch, or to change its expression within a biological system. REFRAMING DESIGN TASKS Extreme miniaturization is usually portrayed as a path to higher speeds, greater efficiencies, more economical use of materials, and lower costs. But it also provides a way of squeezing more functions into smaller packages, so moving them closer to the body (or even inside the skin) and freeing them from fixed locations. Sophisticated computer graphics functions, for example, first became available on terminals attached to mainframe computers, then on desktop workstations, then on portable game consoles and laptops, and now on MEMS based retinal scanning devices. Artificial hearts began as bulky, bedside machines in hospitals, then they shrank sufficiently to become implants.15 In the nano era, possibilities expand further. Richard Feynman imagined putting a tiny, robotic heart surgeon inside a blood vessel, thus dispensing with surgical suites.16 And the irrepressible Ray Kurzweil has even proposed sending billions of nanobots into the brain to replace virtual reality goggles; \"If you want to be in real reality, the nanobots sit there and do nothing, but if you want to go into virtual reality, the nanobots shut down the signals coming from my real senses, replace them with the signals I would be receiving if I were in the virtual environment, and then my brain feels as if it\u2019s in the virtual environment.\u201d17 It\u2019s like Alzheimer\u2019s, but with active, benevolent nanobots rather than passive, destructive platelets. From a network control viewpoint, it makes sense; instead of replacing signals to a couple of nodes (eyeballs) at the very edge of the neural network, go for lots of nodes at the core of the network. This shift back to the body has also altered the context and framing of design tasks. Wall and desktop telephones, for example, have long been assimilated to the tradition of mechanical and electrical appliance design\u2014that of clocks, toasters, coffee grinders, and stereos. Their designers are schooled in the minimalist, universalist ways of the Bauhaus and Ulm, and the most elegant exemplars find their way to the industrial design section of MoMA. But cellphones are increasingly conceived of as personal accessories\u2014much like wallets, handbags, shoes, hats, neckties, and spectacles. It is turning out that gender, age, and status markers are important; a senior, male financial executive usually wants something that goes with his suit, while a Japanese teenage girl may prefer Hello Kitty. When phones migrate from walls and desktops to pockets, they also move into the domain of fashion design and marketing\u2014and their forms and styles, like those of clothing, proliferate endlessly. When you begin to wear them as emblems, rather than carry them as tools, they play a different cultural role. With computers, the shifts have been even more dramatic. Mainframes were designed as large scale items of industrial equipment, and at their best\u2014in the hands of Charles Eames, for example\u2014achieved a tough, hard edged, machine age clarity of form.18 They were often put on display in special, glass enclosed rooms. The bulky computer workstations of the 1970s and 1980s were medium scale wheeled furniture\u2014not too different from writing desks, pianos, and treadle sewing machines, but styled for laboratory rather than domestic environments. PCs evolved from clumsy beige boxes to sleekly specialized, variously colored and shaped versions for offices, classrooms, and homes.19 Now that they are fading into history, after a life of approximately twenty years, they look increasingly like surrealist construc tions\u2014the chance encounter of a typewriter and a television on a desktop. Portables started out mimicking luggage (right down to the handles and snaps), then appropriated the imagery of books that could open, close, and slip into a briefcase. Even smaller versions snuggled into pockets and handbags, like cigar cases, hip flasks, and makeup compacts. Next, as components became tinier, and as designers realized that parts could be interconnected flexibly rather than packed into rigid plastic or metal boxes, computers became conformable to the contours of the body. They had evolved from heavy machinery into close fitting wearables; you could begin to imagine wiggling into them like gloves, folding them into pockets like handkerchiefs, or sporting them like neckties. Ultimately, you might think of them as smart, barely visible particles. Once, designers separated their domains by scales and associated functional categories; circuit designers and nanotechnologists operated in the nanometer to millimeter range, product designers went from millimeters to meters, architects typically dealt with details at millimeter scale and overall building dimensions of tens or hundreds of meters, while urban designers and civil engineers might work on infrastructure and land use systems extending over many kilometers. Today, such scale chauvinism makes little sense. The solution to a given design problem might be found at any scale or combination of scales\u2014 and an increasing amount of functionality that once resided in large, immobile structures and machines is now squeezed into portable, wearable, and even molecular devices. It makes even less sense to draw sharp distinctions between nonliving and living systems. As biology, materials science, mechanical engineering, and electronics all get down to the molecular scale, they deal with the same types and sizes of structures, and there is a growing crossover of interests and goals. As biologists engage ideas of modular recombination, splicing, and cloning, they begin to think like designers. Conversely, as designers tentatively embrace concepts of emergence, self organization, self assembly, and self replication, they start to sound like biologists. Increasingly, the CAD console meets the wet lab, and the circuit shop keeps company with the chemistry bench. MULTIFUNCTIONALITY Growing reliance upon small scale systems\u2014particularly miniaturized, portable electronics\u2014has also produced rampant hybridization of devices. Not so long ago, for example, telephones were desktop or pocket devices for audio communication, cameras were optical/ mechanical/chemical devices for picture taking, and GPS navigation systems were bulky items of equipment for boats and airplanes. By about 2002, though, all of these devices could be squeezed into the same portable, electronic box\u2014and their combination opened up a surprisingly useful new possibility; you could take a picture and instantly transmit it, along with a map of the place where the picture was taken.20 Servers could begin to accumulate image databases\u2014with automatic indexing by time and date, location, and author\u2014from multiple, mobile, remote sources. Similarly, cellphones and PDAs, which had arrived upon the scene as separate boxes, began to fuse into one.21 This convergence was prompted, in part, by the competition for pocket and handbag space; why carry around two boxes when you can get what you need from one? And it was also motivated by the search for economies; why double up on power supplies, processors, display screens, and keyboards? But its most important consequence was the convenient integration of functions that had hitherto been separate; why keep your address book and your dial up device in separate, disconnected boxes? There is, however, a crucial space time tradeoff to consider. When a device such as a Swiss Army knife or a PDA provides access to many different functions, you can only make use of one of these functions at a time, and you have to switch from mode to mode\u2014 from the knife blade to the corkscrew, for example, or from the address book to the calendar. Conversely, a spatial array of single purpose knives, corkscrews, and so on takes up more space, but there is no time wasting and potentially confusing mode switching, and you can store each special device in its context of use\u2014the corkscrew near the wine rack, and so on. Where space is scarce and there is little or no fixed infrastructure to rely upon, as in a hiker\u2019s backpack, multifunctionality and form factor minimization tend to win. Where space is fairly tight, as in a tiny city apartment, multimodal devices such as sofa beds may still make sense. But where there is plenty of room and a lot of fixed infrastructure, as in a large suburban house, it is far more convenient to provide special purpose devices in their contexts of use\u2014beds in bedrooms, sofas in living rooms, corkscrews at bars, and knives in kitchens. It makes a difference if you can switch modes easily; unfolding a sofa bed for sleeping is aggravating and time consuming, but picking a function from a menu on a PDA is not so bad. Context sensitivity, if it can be reliably achieved, is even better; a really smart portable device might know where you are and what you need to do there, and adjust its current mode accordingly. Miniaturized, mobile devices sometimes allow us to save time by performing tasks while we are in motion. Most of us, for example, have no difficulty listening to the radio while jogging or driving. But our capacity to pay attention is limited, so driving while talking on a cellphone is riskier. When you need to use keyboards and view video screens, it is wise to stop, sit down, and give them your undivided attention. As broadband wireless connections deliver fatter streams of bits to the mobile body, attention management will become an increasingly crucial design issue. The mechanisms may be very simple, as when voicemail or TiVo allow you to defer attention to data streams until you are ready. Or they might depend upon sophisticated context sensitivity\u2014enabling a cellphone or automobile navigation system to interrupt you only when it is safe to do so, but to be bolder when the message is really urgent. As devices become smaller, as software takes over more functions from hardware, and as space time tradeoffs are critically reevaluated, traditional functional categories may no longer hold. Electronic devices may readily be assembled into unprecedented combinations that provide hitherto unavailable functional mixes. These assemblies may be stuffed into compact packages, or they may be constructed through dispersed network connections. Through wireless interconnections, these functions may be divided, in whatever ways turn out to be most convenient, between smaller, wearable devices and larger elements of immobile infrastructure. And, by virtue of their embedded electronics, objects that have long performed traditional functions\u2014 from items of clothing to sheets of wallboard\u2014will acquire increasingly important ancillary functions. Where efficiency matters, as in the layout of a chip, form follows function in rigorous fashion; sophisticated optimization techniques are used to minimize the distances that electrons must move through surfaces, to pack components as densely as possible onto scarce chip real estate, and to assure that heat is effectively dispersed. Conversely, at scales and speeds where the lengths of the wired or wireless linkages among standard electronic components have trivial effect upon performance, designers have enormous freedom to shape electronic assemblies into arbitrary sculptural forms, to mold them to the contours of the body, to conceal them within other objects, and so on. During the 1980s, the Department of Industrial Design at London\u2019s Royal College of Art championed this freedom, and many innovative designs for electronic products emerged\u2014most notably, perhaps, Daniel Weil\u2019s designs for transistor radios. More recently, designers of electronic toys have exploited it in increasingly imaginative ways\u2014dolls converse electronically, toy vehicles acquire sophisticated electronic functionality, electronic dogs and other pets learn from their environments and respond to care; Lego puts electronics into modular building blocks, and Tod Machover\u2019s Toy Symphony blurs the line between electronic play and performance. BACK TO THE BODY All this has intensified interest in the scarce real estate of skin surface and its immediate surroundings. When timepieces resided in clock towers, they competed for central urban sites, but when they shrank to watches, they began to compete for wrist space\u2014scarcer (at least by convention) on female wrists than on male ones. When Marconi set out to build his Atlantic radio telegraph station, he first had to find an industrial scale chunk of real estate on Cape Cod, but when we decide to carry cellphones, we have to find space in our limited pocket, belt, or handbag real estate. Topography established the context for Marconi\u2019s design; anatomy does so for a cellphone design. Where architects have traditionally responded to human needs by allocating square footage for mechanical and electrical systems, furniture, and equipment within the rigid, large scale fabric of buildings, cyborg couturiers are now doing so by locating miniaturized devices within the smaller scale, more flexible fabric that clothes us.22 The microterrain immediately surrounding our bodies is providing habitats (mostly with very limited carrying capacities) for new, electronic species, which may be classified according to their sizes and shapes (known in the trade as their form factors), their modes of attachment to the body, their degrees of conformability to the body, and their degrees of visibility. You can think of these species as electronic parasites that both depend upon their hosts and provide benefits to them. And these parasites are evolving rapidly as they compete for the available niches within this up close and personal terrain. Traditionally, these niches and species have been explored most rigorously by designers of gear for foot soldiers\u2014who need to be as effectively equipped as possible, but who cannot be expected to lug too much weight. A Roman centurion carried around about forty five pounds, but a modern soldier may be burdened with three times that. Not surprisingly, then, the U.S. Army has been quick to establish an Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology, focusing on \"threat detection, threat neutralization (such as bullet proof clothing), concealment, enhanced human performance, real time automated medical treatment, and reduced logistical footprint.\u201d23 According to the director: \"This will be achieved by creating, then scaling up to commercial level, revolutionary materials and devices composed of particles or components so tiny that hundreds could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.\u201d Reversing their usual tendency, weapons systems planners are beginning to think small. ELECTRONIC PARASITE NICHES Some emerging, miniature electronic species find their niches\u2014at least initially\u2014in the strap on, backpack systems such as the packs of hikers and foot soldiers, and the wearable equipment of scuba divers. These systems typically consist of fairly large, rigid elements linked by flexible fabric, leather, or hinges so that they can conform reasonably closely to the contours of the back. The more loosely strapped, shoulder hung variants can accommodate smaller objects, such as cameras. This part of the terrain has a lot of carrying capacity, but it produces cumbersome, clumsy appendages (which are particularly irksome indoors and in confined spaces), so it is best avoided whenever greater miniaturization provides the opportunity. The possibility of gripping large objects of arbitrary shape in the hand provides another attractive parasite niche. Historically, it has been occupied by the luggage of travelers, by large weapons\u2014from spears to shotguns\u2014or by specialized mechanical devices like portable typewriters. Generally you can only carry one or two things, so competition for this niche is intense. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the winner was often the gentleman\u2019s walking cane, which therefore acquired an astonishing range of specialized secondary func tions\u2014weapon cane, tippling cane, pooper scooper cane, forked cane for trapping snakes, bicycle pump cane, seat cane, gun rest cane, cigarette case cane, gas lighter cane, watch cane, spyglass cane, zither cane, flashlight cane, cologne cane, and many more.24 Today the victor in this niche is commonly a laptop computer with a handle or carrying case\u2014a device of high functionality that cannot easily move into smaller scale habitats because of the need for large screens and convenient keyboards. Like the cane, it can accommodate numerous secondary functions\u2014now provided by plug in peripheral devices, such as DVD drives for playing movies. The principle is the same, though the form factor (driven by the primary function) is different. But the laptop\u2019s victory is a tenuous one; handheld objects are always in danger of being put down for something else. The traditions of clothing design have established an important niche for electronic parasites that can be slipped into pockets or hung in pouches and holsters on belts. Since bulging pockets are uncomfortable, and tend not to be regarded as a fashion plus, this niche imposes severe restrictions on the length, width, and thickness of objects. And, since pockets are flexible containers that may be subject to stresses as the body moves, it is an advantage for objects compet ing for pocket space to be flexible, conformable, and resilient. So far, the most successful electronic invaders of pocket space have been cellphones, PDAs, and electronic cards of various kinds. Devices that can squeeze into this niche can become almost as inseparable from us as our underwear. As miniaturization reduces more electronic devices to pocket size, and as new polymer based technologies enable flexible batteries and circuits, the competition for pocket space is likely to intensify. Still smaller electronic parasites may be sewn to clothing like buttons, pinned on like badges, strapped on like watches, or directly attached (with or without body piercing) like finger rings, navel jewelry, and ear studs. Cameos and lockets may run video loops instead of displaying static images, and sparkle may be provided electronically rather than by the cut of a gem. At this scale, conformability and flexibility matter less; jewel like devices can, without producing discomfort or inconvenience, be rigid and quite freely shaped. Furthermore, systems of rigid, jewel sized elements can be connected flexibly (like strings of beads) to make much larger, conformable constructions. Let\u2019s not forget teeth. If you have to get a gold tooth or ceramic crown, why not pack it with electronics? If your teeth carried an RFID tag, you might make purchases or open hotel room doors by flashing a smile. Maybe a memory filling would be a good, safe place for your crucial medical records. And, if you squeezed a wireless speaker into a molar, you could take advantage of the fact that your jawbone efficiently transfers sound and eliminate the earpiece of your hands free cellphone. The generalization to nails and lashes is obvious. And finally, of course, electronic parasites are increasingly capable of getting under your skin. Although they have been framed culturally in very different ways, the practices of body piercing and subdermal implantation are not far apart technologically. You can, for example, have a rice grain sized RFID chip injected by syringe to provide purchasing power and location tracking capability.25 Deeper within the body, we will increasingly find cochlear implants, internal defibrillators, and miniature devices incorporating sensors and transponders capable of measuring blood pressure and other conditions transmitting data wirelessly to external receivers. These devices are more permanently attached than external wearables, and you do not have to remove them to take a shower. Some of these proliferating parasites can attach themselves wherever there is room, but others require particular anatomical contexts. Thus there are growing, highly specialized genres of miniaturized eyepieces, earpieces, mouthpieces, and even nosepieces\u2014all of which may, on occasion, be integrated into specialized masks or helmets. Wrists are good places not only for displaying time but also for other small screen information. Shoes can provide convenient, well engineered housing not only for batteries but also for generators that harvest the energy of footsteps to recharge them\u2014and maybe even for energy storage and actuators that would enable you to leap tall buildings in a single Superman bound. And complete exoskeletons, composed of nanoparticles and electroreological fluids, promise both protection and the superhero accoutrement of a stiff, high powered \"forearm karate glove.\u201d26 Of course, you don\u2019t have to be Stan Lee to imagine Marvel Comics scenarios other than those sketched by researchers in search of military funding; imagine street protestors who could effortlessly vault over riot police, equestrian and motorcycle gear that stiffened into a protective carapace when you were thrown off, and exoskeleton extreme sports. SMART THREADS Since the accommodation available at any point in intradermal and near extradermal terrain is limited, and since there are efficiencies to be gained by centralizing rather than duplicating common functions, there is a growing need for network linkages among the electronic devices distributed around and within the body. It may make practical sense, for example, to centralize power supply instead of equipping each device with its own batteries or generators. Or there may be multiple, parasitic power generators\u2014sucking in kinetic, thermal, light, and radio frequency energy at various bodily locations\u2014to create a miniature power supply grid. This, then, introduces the need to drape the body with power cords, or\u2014perhaps more elegantly\u2014to weave power distribution circuitry (maybe composed of conductive polymers) into clothing. For data networking there are more options. The links may be wired, as with the connections between pocket telephones or music players and earphones\u2014the wires loosely draped or running elegantly through seams or zippers. Or links may be wireless, allowing anatomical logic rather than contiguity requirements to dictate disposition of functional elements around the body\u2014relatively bulky power supplies and processors in pockets, audio output in the ears, video displays in handhelds, on wrists, or integrated with spectacles, sensors wherever they are needed, and so on. They may even be run (harmlessly) through the body itself. Being smartly turned out will take on a whole new meaning as clothing fibers and fabrics acquire more active functionality and become increasingly programmable.27 They might, for example, expand to keep you warmer in cold weather, open up to provide more ventilation in hot weather, tighten and decrease porosity to become waterproof, change color on command, and stiffen to provide protection in the event of accident or attack. By incorporating microcapsules of phase change material, fabrics might absorb energy to cool you down when you\u2019re sweaty and expel heat to warm you when you\u2019re chilly. Gloves, socks, and tights might be programmed to teach dancers and athletes by applying tactile prompts, or to diagnose injuries by detecting changes in gait. And \u201caccessorizing\u201d will mean adding new devices to your network. Thread with extended functionality will open up new possibilities for the ancient crafts of weaving and embroidery. Electrically conducting thread will allow circuit embroidery. Weaves of actuating thread will allow dynamic, programmable shaping and fitting. Threads that can vary their color will open up the possibility of animated tweeds and plaids. A programmable tie, woven from smart thread, might knot itself automatically and download patterns from the Internet. Just as portable wireless devices are connected to nearby transmission and reception points, networked bodies may become mobile subnetworks of larger networks\u2014maybe using cellphones, wireless PDAs, or button scale transmitters and receivers to establish the necessary external links. They may incorporate RFID tags to electronically provide information about themselves. And, since the body itself produces low powered electromagnetic radiation, it may function as a naked network node\u2014enabling, for example, remote wireless monitoring of heartbeats.28 The ancient, mystical idea of the body\u2019s ineffable aura takes on, in this context, precise engineering meaning. Some of this will probably turn out to be miscalculated science fiction, and some of it will soon seem banal, but it\u2019s the repetition of a familiar theme that matters. Before the industrial revolution, buildings were mostly big, dumb boxes; then they acquired increasingly sophisticated mechanical, electrical, telecommunication, and control systems. Now, by taking advantage of electronics and nanotechnology, the rag trade is following in the footsteps of the construction trade. AMBULATORY ARCHITECTURE As the functionality of small things increases, they are insinuating themselves, like resourceful ticks and fleas, into increasingly intimate spaces. The traditional roles of clothing systems\u2014thermal protection, waterproofing, impact protection, identity signaling, and so on\u2014are being rethought and addressed in radical new ways.29 And the elements of clothing systems are acquiring growing repertoires of new functions. So designers are asking themselves some new kinds of questions. What might you now put in your pockets, wear on your belt, or carry in a backpack? What sorts of functions can you fit into jewelry, and how should jewelry express these? How might underwear and implants work together? What can be fitted, and what must hang more loosely? How much useful electronics can you jam into your shoes or your hat? What should be implanted semipermanently, what should go into inner garments, and what is best accommodated in easily shed outer layers? How can electronic earpieces, eyepieces, and mouthpieces be assimilated to traditions of facial adornment? Can you make use of rings or gloves to sense finger gestures\u2014maybe replacing keyboards? How should wearable devices respond to bodily movement, changes in surrounding conditions, and emergencies? Might programmable, animated tattoos and makeup serve your display needs? What has to be waterproof? Where should we run the bodynets, and what should we run through them? The ongoing shift of functions from urban and architectural to bodily real estate inverts some familiar customs and rituals. You once slipped into a telephone booth to make a call (and Clark Kent did so to change his costume), but you now slip a cellphone out of your pocket. Playing music through a stereo system at a party is a social gesture, but playing it through a Walkman is a way to withdraw. In a movie theater you look for a good seat and orient your eyes to the screen; with a portable display, you sit down anywhere and arrange the screen in front of your eyes. We are evolving our manners and social conventions in response\u2014learning to avert our eyes from our seatmate\u2019s laptop screen and responding to \"no cellphone\u201d signs as our forebears responded to \"no smoking\u201d and \"no spitting.\u201d Where walls once established relatively clear and stable boundaries among social settings, mobile devices create unexpected, and sometimes difficult to manage juxtapositions. When your cellphone rings, there is a potential conflict between the behavioral requirements of your current physical setting and those of your electronic environment. You might choose one over the other, thereby alienating your companion or your caller, or the parties to the call might pass the phone around to their companions, using a simple ritual to bind distant social settings temporarily together. You might also scramble social settings, to the possible discomfort of others, by taking work calls in domestic or recreational settings, or personal calls in formal work settings. And you might unconsciously let the demands of one setting dominate those of the other, making motorists wish that you would shut up and drive, lecturers wish that you would look up from your screen and listen, and callers wish that you weren\u2019t simultaneously emailing someone else. And all this, of course, transforms the ancient logic of threat and defense; the suicide bomber, with a small but powerful explosive device strapped inconspicuously under his shirt, is dramatic testimony to that. Airport security managers have become very interested in shoes. Miniature, self actuating weapons\u2014from high powered letter bombs to anthrax spores\u2014may be sent through the mail and might even be attached to insects or nanorobots. And it no longer suffices to frisk for guns and knives; checkpoints must rely increasingly upon sophisticated electronic detection of concealed devices and tiny traces of chemicals and biological agents. The boundary is blurring between systems that render the body transparent for medical purposes, such as x ray machines, and those that do so for security. As miniaturization continues, and as more and more functionality migrates to the body, literally off the wall (and into the skin zone) design moves will cease to seem so strange. We will indeed approach the condition of \"walking architecture.\u201d We will be forced to abandon the macho prejudice that soft \"fashion\u201d is frivolous, while hard \"construction\u201d is serious. The functions of flexible, mobile clothing will be tightly integrated with those of rigid, fixed infrastructure. The IEEE will meet Vogue, and MIT will find common ground with FIT; the subtle skills of the clothing designer will be drawn together with those of the electronics engineer and the nanotechnologist to redefine radically the role of the first few millimeters surrounding our perspiring biological perimeters. 5 SHEDDING ATOMS There are ultimate limits to the miniaturization of machinery; you eventually get down to atom by atom assembly (as imagined by the nanotechnologists), and there you have to stop\u2014unless you consider atoms themselves as machines for producing subatomic particles. But with pure information products it\u2019s different; you can shuck bits entirely from their material substrates. You can store, reproduce, and transmit them as completely dematerialized patterns of electromagnetic energy. One effect of this (in combination with the miniaturization of electronics) is to compress storage. We can now keep almost unimaginable quantities of digital information on servers the size of domestic appliances. And we can effortlessly carry entire libraries around with us in compact, lightweight, portable devices; pocket MP3 players, for example, can now contain the sorts of music libraries that once took the form of shelves of vinyl disks. A second effect is to transform the character of information products. Digital texts, images, and other artifacts begin to behave differently from their heavier, materially embedded predecessors. They become nonrival assets\u2014they are neither depleted nor divided when shared, they can be reproduced indefinitely without cost or loss of quality, and they can be given away without loss to the giver.1 Thus they can support the dissemination, application, and creative recombination of innovations on a massive scale\u2014provided, of course, that intellectual property arrangements do not get in the way. A third effect of information dematerialization is to revolutionize logistics. Instead of relying upon physical transportation systems, with their strict speed and capacity limits, we can pump bits through wires at the speed of light. As network bandwidth increases, we can do this in larger and larger quantities. And as the Internet has so dramatically demonstrated, we can employ computer intelligence to manage complex flow and delivery processes automatically. And yet another effect\u2014a particularly powerful one in combination with all of these\u2014is to enhance the mobility of information producers and consumers. Increasingly, we can download whatever we want, whenever we want it, to portable wireless devices. Conversely, we can upload products that we create while on the move. This challenges the very idea of a fixed workplace. Dematerialization delivers us from servitude to places and things\u2014and, indirectly, from domination by those who control places and things. It undermines the regime of physicality. It constructs a new form of power and simultaneously provides a new way to resist power. DEMATERIALIZED TEXT Take text, for example. When it was inscribed in stone and clay, it didn\u2019t move very much; to gain access, you traveled to it. Then, when it shifted to lightweight sheet materials\u2014papyrus, parchment, and paper\u2014it began to circulate. Medieval monasteries became nodes in manuscript production, distribution, and consumption networks. With cheaper and more plentiful paper, printing, more efficient and reliable transportation, and mass literacy came large scale, high volume mail networks. Next, the telegraph network eliminated the paper substrate (over the long distance legs of communication systems, at least), and demonstrated that short, electronically encoded strings of characters could move far faster than the swiftest messenger. Finally, digital storage and processing, ASCII coding, packet switching, and high bandwidth electronic channels enabled the highspeed transmission of very large quantities of text. Today, through email, instant messaging, and the Web, text mostly comes to you in completely dematerialized form. You can see the effects of all this in the varying forms that libraries have taken, and the social and intellectual roles that they have played. Before texts were mobilized, large concentrations of manuscripts functioned as powerful magnets for scholars and centers of scholarly communities.2 The great Library of Alexandria, for example, attracted scholars from all over the Hellenistic world. The more extensive and renowned its collection of hundreds of thousands of scrolls became, the more scholars needed to be there. The surrounding community became increasingly rich in intellectual talent, and the daily interactions among members of that community multiplied the benefit\u2014often yielding new manuscripts that ended up back in the library. This was, of course, the beginning of the modern idea of the university. Millennia later, the mechanism was still working just fine; when the more scholarly protagonists of Ulysses got together after lunch in the National Library at the Heart of the Hibernian Metropolis, the books brought them there and the intellectual interchange followed. Well into the age of print, it remained slow, expensive, and difficult to build large book collections, so locations fortunate enough to have them sustained a comparative advantage. The buildings that housed them and celebrated their importance were often conceived as central landmarks\u2014the library at the very heart of Venice, the great rotunda and dome at the focus of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s University of Virginia, the proud book towers at Cambridge and Yale. Within these landmarks, card catalogues near the entrances provided compact, central representations of the collections that could be surfed for guidance before venturing into the vast book stacks beyond. But as books became cheaper and more numerous, and distribution systems improved, this traditional comparative advantage began to erode. Even small, isolated communities could now have respectable local libraries; these could not compare to the great central collections, but they sufficed to launch many a scholarly career. Local schools, colleges, and universities could develop their own collections. And individuals could stock their private bookshelves. The system for providing access to accumulated texts devolved into an increasingly multinodal, decentralized network of local storage and redistribution points. As accumulations grew within this system, so did pressure on storage and transportation systems.3 One response was to improve the engineering of bookshelves and bookstacks. Another was to make books smaller and lighter; the pocket book and the paperback emerged. Yet another was to compress more radically by transferring text from paper to microfilm.4 By the mid twentieth century, Vannevar Bush could see where this drive toward miniaturization and dematerialization was leading. In his remarkable vision of the \u201cMemex,\u201d he imagined individual microfilm libraries, stored within desk sized storage and access devices, which would provide individual scholars with inexpensive, immediate, local access to the resources of major col lections.5 And implicitly, he raised questions that were to reverberate, with ever increasing urgency, in the coming decades. To what extent should we treat bound books as valuable objects in themselves, justifying the allocation of space, time, and money for their preservation? And to what extent should we just strip out their information content, transfer it to more compact and mobile media, and toss away the carcasses? It turned out that microfilm was not really up to the task, but the CD ROM and the personal computer were. In 1972, on the Irvine campus of the University of California, the Library of Alexandria was reborn in digital form. The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae ( TLG ) project began, with the ambitious goal of producing a database containing all ancient Greek literature.6 By 2001, the database contained virtually everything surviving from the period between Homer (eighth century b.c.e.) and 600 c.e., plus numerous additional texts from the Byzantine and post Byzantine periods. David Packard\u2019s Ibycus system, and other software, provided sophisticated search and retrieval capabilities. It added up to more than 80 million words, and it was all available to scholars on CD\u2014an astonishing feat of comprehensive accumulation, compression, and distribution that has transformed the daily practices of classical scholarship throughout the world. The TLG, in its initial form, was highly miniaturized but still not completely dematerialized; the plastic disk of the CD remained and required physical transportation to sites of use. But packet switching, the Internet, and eventually the World Wide Web, allowed the remaining atoms to be scraped off.7 Today, if you have a PC, a network connection, and a license, you can get the TLG online. You can download any ancient Greek text you want. Finally, Alexandria comes to you. Encyclopedias have, with astonishing rapidity, followed a parallel developmental trajectory. Until the PC came along, the Encyclopedia Britannica was a bulky, heavy, expensive set of printed volumes. Then the Encarta encyclopedia shrunk itself onto a CD. Now the Britannica has dumped those high priced atoms (for which there is no longer a market) and has gone online\u2014supporting itself through advertising and ancillary service revenues. And in specialized professional fields, subscription supported online databases, such as LexisNexis for lawyers and MEDLINE for medical practitioners and researchers, have made successful businesses out of providing comprehensive access to published articles and papers. Similarly, the Los Alamos e print arXivhas successfully shucked the atoms from physics and mathematics papers\u2014making them instantly available, via the Web, almost anywhere.8 Initiated in 1991 by Paul Ginsparg, it quickly became indispensable to physics researchers throughout the world. Ten years later it was attracting more than 30,000 electronic paper submissions each year. Many researchers had formed the habit of consulting it each morning for the latest postings in their areas of research. It had dramatically quickened the rhythms of communication and collaboration within the international physics and mathematics communities and had gone a long way toward accomplishing its founder\u2019s goal of providing \"a level playing field for researchers at different academic levels and different geographic locations.\u201d9 You no longer had to be at an established, recognized center like MIT or Princeton to be an active, effective intellectual participant. Suddenly, geographic location wasn\u2019t what counted; what really mattered was ready access to a site in cyberspace. Two more recent online scholarly communities, CogNet(for cognitive scientists)10 and ArchNet (for architects throughout the developing world),11 have gone even further. As with arXiv, large online archives are their central attractions. But, like ancient Alexandria, they also provide housing and public spaces for the scholars they attract\u2014 not in bricks and mortar form, of course, but in the forms of online private workspaces, member profiles, forums, news pages, calendars, job listings, and collaborative workspaces. And as such augmented archives have grown in importance, they have increasingly been viewed as crucial, long term community resources.12 By the year 2000, the writing was on the virtual wall. A National Academies report on the Library of Congress bluntly asserted that digital information was \"at the center of contemporary discourse.\u201d It continued: \"That role is a simple fact, unrelated to whatever e zealots or bibliophiles might wish to be the case.\u201d13 As evidence, they could point out that popular Web search engines like Google were, by that point, indexing more than a billion online pages.14 Most of what you needed was just one search away, and most of the rest was at two or three degrees of separation. And with a wireless laptop, you could potentially download any of it anywhere. FOOTLOOSE CODE Speech acts (that is, commands, promises, requests, and other utterances with consequences) have also operated in new ways as text has dematerialized and mobilized. Before mobile, written text, speech acts were local verbal events; you might yell a battlefield command or execute an agreement with a word and a handshake, and these sorts of face to face acts still carry a great deal of social and legal force. With paper came written instructions from remote commanders, contracts in the mail for signature, formal requests and demands, and the distinction between barristers and solicitors. Now, with electronic text, you can send a command by email, execute an agreement by filling out an online form, or do a drug deal with a pager. Some less scrupulous Muslim men have even figured out that they can utter talaq (end a marriage, under Islamic law, by declaring \"I divorce you\u201d three times) using the short message services of cellphones.15 A line of computer code is an important special case of a written command\u2014one that is intended for execution by a machine. (Today, the best way to delegate a task\u2014and to be sure that it is done right\u2014 is to code it for machine execution.) Such code has proliferated explosively in the few decades that we have known electronic computation, and the practical consequences of its growing mobilization have been profound. In the 1960s punch cards were a standard storage and input medium for computer software; a program and its data might consist of several thousand pieces of perforated cardboard. Their information density was extraordinarily low\u2014much less that that of a printed page. They were handled by means of large, noisy, unreliable mechanical devices: keypunches, sorters, and readers. They were vulnerable to jamming, tearing, burning, and getting left out in the rain. When you threw them out (as you did frequently) you generated a significant quantity of trash. If you were a programmer, you probably spent a lot of time in the keypunch room of a computer center, when you were not walking back and forth to the job submission window with boxes and printouts under your arm. As magnetic media became cheaper and denser, they gradually took over the role of program and data storage. Reel to reel tapes, tape cartridges of various kinds, and floppy disks gradually made code lighter, less bulky, and more portable. When the personal computer arrived in the 1980s, PC software was distributed in shrinkwrapped boxes, and sneakernet (walking with a floppy in your hand) served for transfer among machines. Some early personal computers had no hard drives and only became useful when you stuck in a disk. Then inexpensive, capacious hard disks, combined with increasingly efficient networking, precipitated a move to online software distribution. Instead of purchasing software from a retail store and lugging it home in a cardboard box, you could now simply download it over the Internet. (This proved particularly convenient for software updates.) The need for floppy disks and CDs greatly diminished, and readers for removable media were no longer essential components of desktop and laptop computers. Responding to its new environment, code itself evolved. Early programming languages, such as Fortran, had been designed with punch cards explicitly in mind; cards had eighty columns, so Fortran code used lengthy sequences of statements comprising eighty or fewer characters. But network era languages, such as C+ +, provided much greater formatting flexibility and allowed programmers to organize code into modular, reusable units known as objects. Then Java fully mobilized code by making it easy to download and execute such units on any networked device\u2014a process that quickly became familiar to browser users, who increasingly found themselves downloading Java applets to run on screen animations and perform specialized tasks. Today, code moves fluidly around networks\u2014both wired and wireless\u2014and may take up residence wherever there is available memory. Once resident on a device, it takes control of that device\u2019s actions\u2014usefully, in the case of the software that runs your MP3 player, cellphone, or automobile, but destructively in the case of the virus that attaches itself to an incoming email message, takes over your PC, displays a mocking message, then wipes out your hard disk. Function is fungible; you download the reader with the file, the TV set with the television signal. Dematerialized and radically mobilized code has become allied with the memory and computation capability now embedded in gadgets and machines of all kinds and with the increasingly comprehensive networking of these devices. Together they create a powerful, ubiquitous, rapidly growing structure of commands, conventions, and controls. Increasingly, we live out our daily lives within its invisible boundaries. As the Y2K scare and related efforts to track down and fix errant code revealed, its grip has quickly become global and inescapable.16 Code is mobile. Code is everywhere. And code\u2014for both machines and the people who interact with them\u2014is the law.17 WEIGHTLESS PICTURES Primitive pictures came attached to rocks. The earliest extant examples are daubed on the walls of caves, and they are inseparable from the sites of their creation. But, like texts, pictures have lost weight and mobilized themselves in more recent times. The first move was to the walls of buildings. These provided more convenient working surfaces and allowed the development of sophisticated, precisely controllable graphic techniques\u2014that of fresco painting, for example. The permanent presence of a picture often determined space use. An altarpiece in a church, for example, oriented worship; today it might provide churches an opportunity to charge tourists for admission. Application of drawing and painting skills to smaller, lighter, more portable surfaces\u2014wooden panels, stretched canvases, sheets of paper, and the like\u2014was an obvious next step. In nomadic and partially nomadic cultures, such as that of the Mughuls, the process of lightening was carried to its logical extreme, and the form of the highly portable miniature emerged. All this had surprisingly far reaching consequences. It shifted picture production from construction sites to specialized painters\u2019 studios, and it greatly facilitated the buying and selling, transfer, collection and accumulation of pictures. And pictures became temporary installations in spaces (particularly galleries) rather than permanent features\u2014allowing for reprogramming of spaces by changing the stuff on the walls. Portability also allowed topographic views to be made on the spot, often in the open air, then carried away to serve as visual evidence of distant places. During the great ages of exploration, in particular, expeditions were rarely without their skilled artists. The idea of eyewitness visual reportage emerged, and the construction of a vast, continually expanding visual record of the world began. The trouble with this record, of course, was its vulnerability to inaccuracy, error, and falsehood. But technology soon came to the rescue. Development of perspective projection techniques helped artists (when they wanted to) to achieve higher levels of optical accuracy. Automated projection devices, such as the camera obscura, were even more effective; it seems likely that Vermeer, for one, relied heavily upon them.18 Fox Talbot took the crucial step of mounting a small sheet of photosensitive material, within a light tight box, behind a lens. This provided a fast, precise, automatic way of attaching shaded perspective images to silver atoms smeared on glass or paper. The technological history of photography, from that point on, is a chronicle of miniaturization, acceleration, and increasingly efficient distribution. Emulsions became finer grained and faster, exposures became effectively instantaneous, large format glass plates gave way to 35 mm film, tripods mostly disappeared, and cameras became smaller, lighter, and more portable. Photographs accumulated in albums and archives. Through halftoning, photography was combined with printing, and illustrated books, magazines, and newspapers began to flood the world. Photographers, photojournalists, and photo editors increasingly took over creation of the rapidly expanding visual record\u2014a record that gained authority not only from its verisimilitude, but also from the fact that rectangles of emulsion coated material had, potentially verifiably, been exposed at particular moments in particular places. The photographer, unlike the muralist or studio bound painter, could claim, \"I was there.\u201d The era of photography\u2014of relatively lightweight, easily produced, inexpensive, efficiently reproduced and distributed, optically accurate, verifiable images\u2014lasted for about a century and a half. Then in the 1990s, attached atoms got the coup de grace. CCD arrays began to replace photographic film on the picture planes of cameras, images were captured and stored as completely dematerialized digital files, and digital photography rapidly became commonplace. Image processing software running on personal computers replaced developing tanks and enlargers and shifted the sites of image crafting from darkrooms to desktops. Digital cameras were combined with cellphones, so that digital images became part of synchronous discourse. Simultaneously, the explosively growing World Wide Web provided a way to distribute digital images with unprecedented speed, cost effectiveness, and geographic coverage. Pornographers were, of course, among the first to discover that graphic Web sites beat the printed page. FILMLESS MOVIES Moving images were almost weightless from the beginning. Some early display devices featured photographs attached to revolving disks or drums, but these were hopelessly cumbersome and only good for a few seconds of flickering motion. Before long, sprocketed transparent film had become the standard\u2014allowing splicing, editing, and movie narratives of unlimited length, the results being projected up to mural size. But unlike murals, of course, these projected images were not attached to the underlying surfaces; they were ephemeral, completely immaterial overlays\u2014repeatable versions of the moving images that had been projected by the camera obscura. Electronics eventually eliminated even the residual materiality of the projected image. Video cameras encoded moving images as electromagnetic signals, which could be broadcast through the air, carried through a wire, or recorded on magnetic tape, then displayed (for as long as the signal lasted) on a phosphor coated screen. In the digital era, CCD arrays were quickly incorporated in video cameras, and digital signals, recording media, and displays replaced their analog predecessors. In microcosm, the technology of classroom and business presentations has recapitulated this chronicle of progressive dematerialization. First there were slates, blackboards, and whiteboards, which presented text and images as thin, removable layers of atoms on flat surfaces. Then came slide and transparency projectors, which shrunk these layers, and displaced them from the display surface to a plane near the light source. And finally, there were PCs, Powerpoint, MPG clips, and video projectors. By now, cyberspace contains the largest and most mobile accumulation of still and motion pictures the world has ever known\u2014far more extensive than the greatest picture gallery, photo or film archive, or library of illustrated books. Some of it resides in organized image archives, such as Corbis\u2014a direct successor to the stock photo archives of earlier days, but much of it is simply scattered across the Web\u2019s innumerable pages and reveals itself piecemeal as we surf. As a result, the average weight of the images we encounter each day is asymptotically approaching zero. INVISIBLE MONEY Coins are a fascinating special case of text and images with atoms attached\u2014lots of them. Originally, the value of a coin was that of its constituent metal; minting merely served to standardize the weight and therefore the value. So the forger\u2019s only option was to substitute some less precious atoms.19 The process of abstraction, miniaturization, and dematerialization of money began when coins became metonyms\u2014fragments representing larger stocks of precious metal or other valuable items stored in some safe place, and available to pay debts if necessary. Size and weight were no longer direct indicators of value; these properties became graphic design decisions. You needed to know who was backing up the value with their treasury, so (following Alexander the Great) the embossed head of the sovereign usually appeared. This allowed currency units to be smaller, lighter, and easier to carry. And, to support geographically extended systems of exchange, they could be moved around at stagecoach or railroad speed. It was then a short step from metal to paper\u2014that is, to bills of exchange, checks, and banknotes. Paper was lighter still, and particularly convenient for large denominations, which would otherwise require burdensome quantities of coinage. (Smugglers and money launderers are particularly fond of high value banknotes, like the 500 Euro, since their great value to weight ratio allows easy concealment for transfer through checkpoints.) And paper was essentially valueless in itself, so forgers turned their attention from adulterating the material to creating convincing facsimiles of the printed text and images. Once metallurgists, they now became graphic artists. Paper money further loosened the connection between material content and value, so that value now became an abstract policy variable. By issuing more paper, and postponing redemption, governments could pay for things. Until 1973, the Bretton Woods system attempted to stabilize currency values by defining them in terms of gold, but that practice has now been almost universally abandoned. These days, paper money primarily provides convenience, and serves to reduce transaction costs in the everyday exchanges that drive market economies. Meanwhile, the telegraph introduced the possibility of wiring money, and created a profitable business for Western Union. By this point, financial transfers no longer required the exchange of metal or paper, but could be accomplished simply by rewriting numbers from column to column in the ledgers of financial institutions. And this rewriting could be triggered by suitable electronic messages. This increased the speed and further reduced the cost of transactions at a distance. The modalities of theft correspondingly multiplied; you could stick up banks or armored cars to get your hands on physical tokens, you could forge those tokens, you could take the white collar option of fiddling the ledgers to your advantage, or you could subvert the telecommunications system to commit wire fraud. With computers and digital telecommunications, the ledgers became online databases, software began to manage electronic trans fers, and money acquired a complex, hybrid representation.20 Heavy, durable coins still have a residual function; people carry them in small quantities, and use them to feed parking meters, Coke machines, subway turnstiles, and other electromechanical devices. Banknotes are folded in wallets and are employed for larger purchases. Light plastic credit cards and debit cards are also carried in wallets; these carry electronic identification and can be inserted into reading devices that will trigger electronic transfers or disgorge banknotes. Transponder equipped smart cards and keychain devices (such as Speedpass and SmarTrip) transmit billing information to gas pumps, subway turnstiles, vending machines, and other payment points.21 Online, you don\u2019t even need the plastic; the credit card number suffices to initiate a transaction. Some pioneering dot coms, like PayPal, have gone further, demonstrating the possibility of emailing money or even beaming it from one portable, wireless device to another. In larger quantities, completely abstracted and dematerialized money now flows from institution to institution at breathtaking speed through electronic trading systems and funds transfer networks.22 Encrypted electronic transfer can cut transaction costs to the point where micropayments become imaginable. Potentially, this radically reduces the granularity of transactions. Instead of purchasing a complete book, you might make a micropayment each time you access a page online. Similarly, you might make a micropayment whenever you download and replay a recorded musical performance. Conversely, you can make huge payments\u2014the equivalents of truckloads of banknotes\u2014in an instant. Electronics releases us from traditional constraints on transfer scale and granularity. Furthermore, financial transactions need not be restricted to the direct digital equivalents of coins and banknotes; they can involve complex abstractions, such as derivatives\u2014entities that could not exist anyplace other than cyberspace. And transactions may no longer be under direct human control\u2014the electronic equivalents of handing over cash; they may become highly automated, as with programmed stock trading. Architecture has reflected money\u2019s evolving abstraction, dematerialization, and retreat from visibility. Banks used to be built around their fortified vaults\u2014the places where wealth accumulated in the most literal sense. They were serviced by highly visible armored vehicles and located prominently within communities to facilitate deposits and withdrawals of coins and notes. Later, automated teller machines combined electronic transfer capabilities with miniature, automatically operated vaults to provide more effective geographic coverage and 24 hour service. At around the same time, retail stores and restaurants installed unobtrusive electronic card readers at points of sale in place of grand mechanical cash registers. Then networked personal computers allowed financial transactions to be performed online, just about anywhere. As money has emancipated itself from the last vestiges of materiality, sites of accumulation and transfer\u2014once prominent, architecturally celebrated urban elements\u2014have waned into commodified electronic boxes, anonymous server farms, and out ofsight back offices. MOBILIZED MUSIC To mobilize music, you need to detach it not only from the site of its initial performance but also from the moment. You have to displace and time shift vibrations in the air. Traveling troubadours did so by memorizing tunes and traveling from place to place. Musical themes and ideas diffused through face to face contact at performance times. Maybe you improvised together\u2014much as jazz musicians still do. You had to be there. From the ninth century in Europe, musical notation has provided a way to externalize the musician\u2019s memory\u2014to write down and preserve specifications for performances of a work. The first music books then functioned, as Nelson Goodman put it in a famous definition, as \"the authoritative identification of a work from performance to performance.\u201d This served, among other things, to establish a uniform liturgical practice dictated by the church authorities, and to limit the scope for improvisation. The practice of writing down musical scores distinguished logically between composers and performers (though, of course, one person might sometimes perform both roles), and separated music, in subtle but profound ways, from art forms such as painting. Painters do not normally set out to comply with scripts or scores; their works are the unique products of particular authors, working at particular times, in particular places. In Goodman\u2019s terminology, they are autographic. But scored or scripted works may have indefinite numbers of performances, at different moments and locations; they are allographic.23 Allographic works may be performed not only by human artists, but also by mechanical devices equipped with the capacity to follow appropriately encoded scores. At the end of the nineteenth century, Edwin S. Votey\u2019s pianola vividly demonstrated this possibility. In its earliest form, it consisted of a large wooden cabinet that stood in front of a standard piano. Felt covered wooden levers, protruding from the rear, were aligned with the piano keyboard. Sequences of notes were encoded as perforations on paper rolls, which controlled the operation of these mechanical fingers. Pianola rolls could be recorded at a keyboard, or more usually, perforated by a technician working directly from a score. In the decades that followed, more sophisticated player pianos and reproducing pianos emerged, and supported two distinct streams of practice. Frequently, player piano technology was employed to capture and reproduce keyboard performances by famous artists\u2014producing, for example, an important legacy of jazz and ragtime from that era. At other times, composers used the technology as a way to transcend the limitations of the human hand. In the 1930s, the era of the player piano was brought to an end by the depression and increasing competition from the less expensive, more compact and versatile gramophone. The gramophone, like its immediate ancestor, the phonograph, dealt directly in vibrations. In 1877 Thomas Edison had successfully demonstrated a \"tinfoil phonograph\u201d based upon a foil wrapped cylindrical drum mounted on a threaded axle. A diaphragm connected to a stylus picked up acoustic vibrations and etched corresponding wave patterns on the rotating foil. For playback, a pickup stylus retraced the wave patterns and transmitted the vibrations to the more sensitive diaphragm of the \"reproducer.\u201d Edison recited, \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\u201d into the mouthpiece and replayed the mechanical, tinny sounding echo. There was a compelling symmetry to the Edison process, and Edison saw his device as a personal recorder\u2014much like later tape recorders. But by the 1890s a commercial recording industry was developing. Musicians recorded performances, then record companies mass produced and distributed them as closed, branded items of intellectual property. Eventually there emerged a commercial and legal regime under which consumers could do little more than replay recordings in private; their rights to public replay, to re recording, and to incorporation of recorded material in new works were severely restricted. Recording interests deployed a criminalizing rhetoric of \"theft\u201d and \"piracy\u201d to protect their position. As the popularity of radio broadcasting rose rapidly in the 1920s, the recording and broadcasting industries converged both technologically and commercially. The emergence of RCA Victor\u2014formed after the Radio Corporation of America\u2019s acquisition of the Victor Talking Machine Company\u2014was a decisive moment. Electric microphones and amplifiers replaced the phonograph\u2019s mechanical systems. Recording and broadcast were both centrally concerned with capturing, recording, and distributing electrical audio signals. Sound quality improved, artists could have individual microphones instead of clustering around shared recording horns, and recordings could be edited and recombined. From the birth of the phonograph to the dawn of the digital era, competing recording media proliferated\u2014evolving in the direction of greater fidelity, reduced cost, and reduction in bulk and weight. Phonograph cylinders were manufactured from tinfoil, then wax coated cardboard, then solid wax. Gramophone disks, which first emerged in the 1890s, were made from hard rubber, shellac, vinyl, and even, as a curiosity, from chocolate, with various diameters, and speeds of 78rpm, 331/3rpm, or 45rpm. Wire recorders enjoyed brief popularity. Magnetic tape was packaged in reel to reel and cassette formats, in varying widths, and with differing numbers of tracks. It was an extended effort to minimize the attachment of atoms to music. By 1979, with the introduction of Sony\u2019s Walkman, records and players had shrunk to wearable size. The inevitable move from analog to digital recording formats began in the 1980s, with the introduction of compact disks (CDs) and digital audio tapes (DATs). But the personal computer and the Internet introduced a far more revolutionary possibility\u2014that of capturing, editing, and replaying audio files at any computer, storing them online, and distributing them throughout the world, at high speed, in dematerialized form. Standards to support this new practice began to emerge, and eventually MP3 took hold globally.24 To the consternation of the Recording Industry Association of America, there was soon software to rip MP3 files from CDs and the digital equivalents of the Walkman (notably the Rio MP3 player) for storing and replaying them. Furthermore, an infrastructure to support online music distri bution\u2014particularly directories of available files, search engines, download managers, and software MP3 players\u2014quickly followed. Napster, which appeared in 1999, was the most radically and visibly challenging to the established distribution systems. The key idea of Napster was to coordinate a highly decentralized, peer to peer, Web based distribution system.25 It maintained a central, online directory of available MP3 files but did not store the files themselves on its servers. Instead, Napster users stored files locally and made them available for sharing. When users wanted files they did not have, Napster\u2019s search engine located these files and downloaded them. As the new century dawned, Napster\u2019s intellectual (if not commercial) success could be measured by the way that it was clogging networks and attracting lawsuits from the established recording industry. It had completed the job of dematerial izing and radically mobilizing recorded music.26 GRANARIES TO SERVER FARMS In the b.d. (Before Dematerialization) era, settlements were built around fixed, central sites of material accumulation\u2014typically of excess, storable agricultural produce such as grain. Consider Palladio\u2019s villas in the Veneto, from about the fourth century b.d., for example. They were surrounded by grain fields, vineyards, orchards, and housing for barnyard animals. The harvested grain was stored in the attic (where it also provided insulation), the wine and cheese were stored in the basement (where they remained at an appropriate temperature), and the consumers lived on the grand piano nobile sandwiched in between. Since transportation relied upon muscle power, it mattered a great deal that distances from the fields to the storage areas were short, and that those from storage to consumption were even shorter. There was a clear spatial logic and a wonderful visual clarity to it all; you could take it in at a glance. Then, as increasingly efficient transportation technologies emerged, large cities were organized around extensive distribution networks that incorporated diverse, specialized production, accumulation, and consumption sites. Since transportation costs remained fairly high relative to the value of the things transported, and since transportation over long distances took significant amounts of time, the locations of these sites were largely determined by accessibility considerations; warehouses, for example, needed to be sufficiently accessible both to the factories that supplied them and to the customers they served. Thus, the great industrial cities of the second century b.d., such as Chicago, were shaped by their rail networks. And those of the first century b.d., like Los Angeles, were given form by their freeways. To an observer on the ground, these extended systems made little sense, but from high in the air you could immediately see how they worked. At the dawn of the a.d. (After Dematerialization) era\u2014around Y2K in the older calendar system\u2014yet another pattern emerged. Servers and server farms embedded in high speed telecommunication networks became the crucial, characteristic accumulation sites of new urban formations. Unlike their predecessors, such as granaries, warehouses, bank vaults, and library book stacks, these sites stored dema terialized assets\u2014that is, texts, images, video, music, computer code, and money\u2014in digital format. They were notably inconspicuous, since they consumed relatively little space, were kept discreetly anonymous for security purposes, and offered little opportunity for architectural celebration. Furthermore, they were spatially ambiguous; the common practices of creating backup copies at multiple locations, caching copies at locations near to likely users, distributing databases over numerous different servers, and continually migrating material to new storage hardware made it difficult to specify exactly where particular items were located. (A Web document is not, for example, like a valuable manuscript, such as the Book of Kells, which is perma nently stored at a well known, specific location in Trinity College, Dublin.) And as networks became increasingly pervasive and efficient, the costs of transporting digital items to and from servers were reduced to insignificance relative to the value of the goods; centrality of location no longer mattered much, and important servers could operate effectively in out of the way locations. Finally, with the development of inexpensive, miniaturized electronics, the production and consumption sites related to these servers increasingly dispersed, mobilized, and began to associate themselves with footloose individuals rather than fixed architectural settings. Today, you can download to your portable wireless devices, you can upload from them, and it is of little importance where the servers you access happen to be. Mostly, you don\u2019t know or care. The more you deal in dematerialized goods, the less location and distance concern you. And the less visible are the relationships that really matter. 6 DIGITAL DOUBLIN' In Ulysses, James Joyce taught us to see a city in a new way. From the moment that \"stately, plump Buck Mulligan\u201d wakes to lather and shave, around eight o\u2019clock on the morning of 16 June 1904, until the very second that Molly Bloom\u2019s memory ambiguously replays \"yes I will Yes,\u201d Dublin appears as the site of multiple threads of consciousness unspooling in parallel while the inhabitants go about their business.1 And these threads are continually being interwoven\u2014 revealing relationships and disclosing an intricately intersecting structure of motives and desires\u2014as the protagonists encounter and reencounter one another. This fabric of simultaneous, cross connected subjectivities is constructed mostly through walking, taking the tramcars, and finding face to face encounters in the varied public spaces and private chambers of the city.2 Letters and telegrams arrive, and there is an occasional word to the telephone, but Bloomsday unfurls at the very dawn of the wireless era; there is no FM 104 drive time radio, and there are no cellphones. Contiguity enables connection, distance means disconnection. When Leopold Bloom departs for Dlugacz\u2019s to purchase a kidney for breakfast, he leaves Molly\u2014crucially\u2014with her uninterrupted private thoughts. If he had called her from the porkbutchers\u2014maybe asking her to take off the kettle he had left boiling and scald the teapot\u2014it might all have turned out differently. At one point, however, Bloom does allow himself to speculate about \"a private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time).\u201d3 A century later, this embryonic possibility has puffed up into a pervasive post Joycean reality, and, as Dubliners now gab endlessly into their private wireless telephones, they construct their interlocking narratives in a voice that Bloom would hardly have heard\u2014the electronic present continuous. ELECTRONIC PRESENT CONTINUOUS This characteristic voice of our time has gradually emerged as telecommunications systems have grown in capabilities and coverage. Telegraph and wireless telegraph operators employed it as they tapped out SOS messages describing perilous predicaments. In Australia, from 1888 onward, the telegraph lines were cleared for the annual running of the Melbourne Cup, so that news of the winner could be flashed around the continent in near real time. (Consequently, the whole country still comes to a halt while the race\u2014now broadcast on radio and television\u2014is run.) And at the opening of the first Australian federal parliament, in May 1901, the telegraph was used to create a nationwide \"imagined community.\u201d4 The telephone, by its very live spoken, circuit switched nature, provided a natural medium for the electronic present continuous. And it was soon followed by live radio broadcasts of performances, sporting events, and breaking news. By the 1930s, in Finnegans Wake, Joyce could imagine a radio\u2014a \"tolvtubular daildialler, as modern as tomorrow afternoon and in appearance up to the minute,... with a vital tone speaker\u201d sucking a whole, complex, unfolding world into H. C. Earwicker\u2019s ear. It was, we are informed, \"capable of capturing sky buddies, harbour craft emittences, key clickings, vaticum cleaners, due to woman formed mobile or man made static and bawling the whole hamshack and wobble down an eliminium sounds pound so as to serve him up a melegoturny marygoraumd, eclectrically filtered for allirish earths and ohmes....\u201d HCE\u2014Here Comes Everybody, yes, and Here Comes Electronics, too. As the British Empire slowly expired, the red colored areas of the map preserved a tenuous sense of community through live, shortwave broadcasts of international cricket matches\u2014cutting across time zones and keeping listeners awake at odd hours of the night. In the Soviet Union, wired broadcasts\u2014first to public loudspeakers in the Stalin era, then to private Radio Mayak and Radio Rossiya boxes in the Brezhnev era\u2014provided the government with a direct line to the people, plus a way to keep their attention by broadcasting concerts and hockey games.5 Across fewer time zones, national baseball, football, basketball, and hockey leagues and broadcasts performed a similar unifying function in the United States. Baseball\u2019s most famous moment was given much of its enduring resonance by Russ Hodges\u2019s widely broadcast play by play\u2014the electronic present continuous pegging the needle of rhetorical hyperintensity: Hartung down the line at third, not taking any chances, Lockman without too big a lead at second\u2014but he\u2019ll be running like the wind if Thomson hits one. Branca throws... There\u2019s a long drive! It\u2019s going to be, I believe... The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! Bobby Thomson hits into the lower deck of the left field stands! The Giants win the pennant! And they\u2019re going crazy! They\u2019re going crazy! Oh, ho!\u201d6 EYEWITNESS NARRATIVES By eight o\u2019clock in the evening, on Sunday, 30 October 1938, when Orson Welles began presenting The War of the Worlds over the Columbia Broadcasting System, the nuances of the electronic present continuous were long familiar. Listeners knew how to interpret them\u2014and that provided an unprecedented dramatic opportunity. Of course it was just a scary radio play about an unexpected alien attack from the skies, with the characters breaking in to \"regular programming\u201d to provide \"live eyewitness\u201d accounts of fiery destruction in New Jersey and New York. The actors addressed the audience directly, describing events supposedly unfolding before their very eyes: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most terrifying thing I have ever witnessed... Wait a minute! Someone\u2019s crawling out of the hollow top. Someone or... something. I can see peering out of that black hole two luminous disks... are they eyes? It might be a face. It might be... But, as the New York Times reported (in the past tense) next morning: Despite the fantastic nature of the reported \u201coccurrences,\u201d the program, coming after the recent war scare in Europe and a period in which the radio frequently had interrupted regularly scheduled programs to report developments in the Czechoslovak situation, caused fright and panic throughout the area of the broadcast. Telephone lines were tied up with calls from listeners or persons who had heard of the broadcasts. Many sought first to verify the reports. But large numbers, obviously in a state of terror, asked how they could follow the broadcast\u2019s advice and flee the city, whether they would be safer in the \u201cgas raid\u201d in the cellar or on the roof, how they could safeguard their children, and many of the questions which had been worrying residents of London and Paris during the tense days before the Munich agreement.7 It did not matter that the events being described were imaginary\u2014and, indeed, wildly implausible. There was no simple way to know that the \u201cexplosions\u201d were special effects. If you were too far away to be a potential eyewitness yourself (it was clever of Welles to set ground zero on an isolated farm in New Jersey) and too uneducated to catch the scientific howlers (Welles deployed a \u201cgreat astronomer\u201d and other scientific authority figures to deflect critical scrutiny of the details), it was impossible to distinguish fact from falsehood. Electronic signals had demonstrated that they could construct the most outlandish of beliefs and provoke people to act instantly on those beliefs. It was the power of the electronic present continuous voice\u2014the presumed direct connection to simultaneously unfolding, distant events\u2014that caused the trouble. The damage had been done long before Welles got to his final (retrospective voice) disclaimer: This is Orson Welles, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to assure you that The War of the Worlds has no further significance than the holiday offering it was intended to be\u2014the Mercury Theater\u2019s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying \u201cBoo!\u201d Starting now, we couldn\u2019t soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night\u2014so we did the best next thing. We annihilated the world before your very ears, and utterly destroyed the CBS. You will be relieved, I hope, to learn that we didn\u2019t mean it, and that both institutions are still open for business... Today, live eyewitness accounts can be transmitted not just by expensively equipped broadcasters, but also by anyone with a cellphone or instant messaging system. Husbands can describe to their wives the choices they see before them on the supermarket shelves, teenagers can tell their friends where they are and who is hanging out with them, street demonstrators can point out the current positions of the police to their comrades, and celebrity spotters can track the movements of George Clooney through the produce section at Balducci\u2019s. When the hijacked jetliners hit the World Trade Center towers, around nine o\u2019clock in the morning on Tuesday, September 11, 2001, the unfolding events were narrated in thousands of phone calls and instant messages; it was a desperately improvised, scaled up replay of War of the Worlds \u2014but with nobody to step reassuringly out of character at the end. In cities today, electronically propagated narratives flow constantly and increasingly densely. These narratives\u2014superimposed, as they are, on real space in real time\u2014act as feedback loops recursively transforming the very situations that produce them. And, like all narratives, they are of ambiguous reliability\u2014constructed from facts, fictions, and falsehoods in whatever sorts of mixes and combinations their authors care to contrive. In Hugh Kenner\u2019s well known reading, Ulysses is the voice of a cybernetic mechanism\u2014 \u201ca huge and intricate machine, clanking and whirring for eighteen hours\u201d;8 now narrative has rebounded from the pages where novelists had consigned it and has itself become the city\u2019s cybernetic machinery. In the late 1920s (not long before the publication of Ulysses), Dziga Vertov, in Man with the Movie Camera, constructed a closely comparable, day long urban portrait\u2014this time of a Soviet city.9 Like the novel, the film begins with the protagonists awakening in the morning and carries the narrative through the day\u2019s activities to the late evening, intercutting multiple strands of action as it goes. It selfconsciously introduces, on camera, the camera itself, the cameraman, the film, the projector, the projectionist, the theater, the audience, the orchestra, and the flickering screen. And, every now and again, it tweaks us into sudden awareness of the paradoxical nature of its enterprise\u2014for example, by pulling back to reveal that what we took to be a direct view of the city is actually a filmed view, being projected at a later moment before the theater audience. It reminds us that the movie camera and theater represent a dismemberment of the old camera obscura\u2014shifting the glowing projection screen to a different darkened box from the camera lens and temporally displacing the beam of light that enters the system from that which exits. Vertov\u2019s ribbon of spliced celluloid also foregrounds the central, inescapable contradiction of all recorded narrative\u2014the bafflement that, for example, animates Tristram Shandy, in which Tristram\u2019s Uncle Toby starts an autobiography that is slower paced than the events it describes and falls more and more hopelessly behind as life inexorably goes on. You simply cannot sync recorded narratives with the events they describe. That\u2019s what you need tense for. You can set your narrative in the past, so that it continuously recedes into the distance. You can set it at some point in the future, and describe what will be, so that real time eventually catches up with your predictions and passes them by. Or you can try the eyewitness present continuous voice\u2014 but you had better be quicker than Uncle Toby. In any case, the spans of time occupied by the actual events unfolding, the writer writing about them, and the reader reading, will generally be different. But link a video camera to the Web, and these distinctions collapse; Uncle Toby\u2019s paradox suddenly dissolves. You now get Ulysses II, unfolding second by second, in real time. Today you can surf into the Web site of the Irish Times, from anywhere in the world, at any time, to get live Webcam views of the O\u2019Connell Bridge and the Liffey. Or you can click to the Dublin Corporation\u2019s numerous traffic cameras for views of the streets\u2014now car choked\u2014that Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Buck Mulligan strode. And I\u2019m not even counting the private surveillance cameras scattered discreetly around Temple Bar. It\u2019s not just Dublin, of course. A century after Buck Mulligan roused himself to peer down the stairs, the multiple narrative perspectives of the characters in Ulysses have become endlessly proliferating, live video feeds from the world\u2019s cities. In the emerging Webcam era, the city\u2019s cybernetic loops are not only audio and text narratives, but video streams as well. As cities electronically reflect back on themselves, telling is now joined by showing. Like Joyce in far off Trieste, distant Web surfers can construct minutely detailed accounts of the day\u2019s doings in places that may interest them\u2014not by a novelist\u2019s occupation of the minds of his characters, nor by a filmmaker\u2019s shooting and editing, but by following hyperlinks to switch among available video viewpoints. And as to the mode of consciousness induced by this strategy, it is precisely that detected by Hugh Kenner in Ulysses \u2014the mode of a \"sardonic, impersonal recorder, that constantly glints its photoelectric eyes from behind the chronicle of Bloomsday.\u201d10 MANN WITH THE VIDEO CAM Joyce disclosed Dublin by mobilizing his characters, and film or video makers do so by mobilizing their cameras. Thus the agility of the available cameras matters. Indeed, much of the now standard language of film derives directly from the bulk and clumsiness of early movie cameras. Vertov\u2019s camera, as the film itself reveals, was a large, hand cranked box on a tripod. (Uncle Toby would have appreciated that, the faster the cameraman cranked, the slower the eventual projected scene unfolded.) Consequently, many of the shots in Man with the Movie Camera are framed statically; there are a few pans, and only an occasional, daring take from the back of a moving truck. The film\u2019s sense of frantic movement through the city is mostly achieved through skillful construction of fast paced montages. Hollywood has long attempted to overcome the limitations of the camera, and to achieve greater fluidity, by introducing sophisticated motion machinery. For example, the famous extended tracking shot through a Mexican border town, at the beginning of Orson Welles\u2019s Touch of Evil, was a tour de force of the mechanized camera crane. And, more recently, robotically controlled cameras have been increasingly used for precisely choreographed special effects work. The miniaturization of film and video technology has also loosened things up. In particular, the development of light, handheld film and video cameras has enabled a first person, body based style; the camera operator\u2019s mobile eye seems to become the viewer\u2019s eye, and the voiceover commentary seems a whisper in the viewer\u2019s ear. This is characteristic of home videos, and it has been common in documentaries. It has also been used to great effect in a few theatrical films, such as The Blair Witch Project. It was a short technological step from this to the wearable, head mounted video camera\u2014a possibility I first saw instantiated, in the early 1990s, when a talented Media Lab student named Steve Mann walked into my MIT office with video rolling.11 If you have enough wireless bandwidth, you can connect a handheld or head mounted video camera to a transmitter. You can (as Mann did) transmit sequences of images to a Web site for later viewing. Or, as the rollout of G3 cellphone technology demonstrated in 2001, you can transmit live video through a wireless telephone. Thus the \"cinema eye\u201d and the \"radio ear\u201d\u2014technologies that Vertov had seen as alternative ways of reaching the masses\u2014are combined and mobilized. The ultimate in camera miniaturization and mobilization is the \"virtual camera\u201d of three dimensional computer graphics, which shrinks to a weightless point. The effect of this was vividly evident in the early Disney computer animation Tron, in which the \"camera\u201d performs high speed gymnastics that would be unthinkable with a physical device. Now, such effects are commonplace in videogames, and in the exploration of online \"virtual cities,\u201d such as Virtual Helsinki. If model based video eventually replaces today\u2019s image based systems, as some researchers expect, the dimensionless, infinitely mobile camera will become the norm; instead of watching a sporting event through the medium of a few physical cameras and the shots selected by a director, a viewer might \"fly\u201d at will through a live three dimensional model of the stadium. Through miniaturization and mobilization of video cameras, wireless connection, and model based video, the stiff, distant images provided by fixed Webcams will soon be supplanted by fluid, eyewitness perspectives. Electronic images of the city will seem less like digital descendents of Vermeer\u2019s view of Delft and more like retinal traces from Stephen Dedalus in motion. ELECTRONIC TWINS In speech, the shift of reference from present to past events is signaled by tense; \"I am walking down Grafton Street\u201d becomes \"I was walking down Grafton Street.\u201d But video doesn\u2019t have participles. So, there is no perceptible difference in the image when a delay is introduced into the transmission of a video signal; the instant replay of a football play looks exactly the same as the live transmission you saw a moment ago. There is simply an unmarked tense drift. When the hijacked airliners hit the World Trade Center towers on September 11, the moment was captured on video. For hours afterward, in a kind of pornography of explosive violence, the clips were replayed over and over again. On screen, it was hard to tell the difference between the identical towers, and tense drift added another layer of nightmarish ambiguity. As growing numbers of people, around the world, tuned in to these images on their television and computer screens, it often wasn\u2019t clear to them whether they were watching events in real time or replays. As the broadcasts cut back and forth between live and recorded images of the same unfolding scene, this tragedy drifted away from the classical unities. In Manhattan, apartment dwellers simultaneously saw the smoke framed by their television screens and by their windows. Banks of screens in electronics stores flashed the scene in Warholesque multiples. The LEDs in Times Square brought Downtown to Midtown. In the darkened Postmasters Gallery, Wolfgang Staehle\u2019s live feed video projection of the Lower Manhattan skyline (which had opened on September 6) sliced the unfolding chaos into a sequence of eerily silent, luminous landscape stills.12 And, in a suddenly sinister way, Staehle\u2019s successive stills recalled a Photoshop demo; duplicate, erase, paint in some sky effects, eventually substitute something else. Today, a fundamentally new urban condition is emerging\u2014one that was anticipated by Joyce\u2019s repeated, sardonic reference to Dublin as Doublin\u2019, a city marinated in narrative, and inescapably bound up with narrative\u2019s capacity both for reflection and for duplicity. Multiplying thousands of electronic eyes and ears continuously capture the city\u2019s unfolding, interwoven narrative threads, and spin them out into cyberspace. Some of these threads are ephemeral, and disappear instantly. Others sit on voicemail, email, and other servers for a while, then are deleted or automatically fade away. Yet others accumulate permanently, to form an expanding, long term electronic memory trace. And continuously, the narratives\u2014drifting in tense and dislocated spatially\u2014leak back out again into the city through proliferating earpieces, eyepieces, speakers, and screens. In countless spatially and temporally displaced, inherently ambiguous, recombinable fragments, cities electronically double themselves. To find something out, or to get something done in a city, you now have a choice. You can navigate the bricks and mortar half in the time honored way, or increasingly, you can switch to its electronic twin.13 7 ELECTRONIC MNEMOTECHNICS If I send you an email message saying \"stop,\u201d it will show up at whatever time and place you choose to download, and you probably won\u2019t know what to make of it. But if I send you a SMS message it will arrive instantly, you will have a definite temporal context, and you will probably understand that I want you to stop something you are doing right now, wherever you may be. (Similarly, the muezzin\u2019s call to prayer is temporally specific but spatially universal; if you\u2019re faithful, you\u2019re meant to heed it right now, wherever you happen to be.)1 If you encounter a stop sign as you approach a street intersection, there is a definite spatial context to give meaning to the message; you are supposed to stop right there, whenever you approach the intersection. And, if a cop with a gun yells \"stop\u201d as you flee, the spatial and temporal contexts are both definite; he means right there, right now. Some sorts of messages, like the old IBM slogan \"Think!,\u201d are less context specific. It also does not matter, in one sense, when and where you read the Theorem of Pythagoras; it is universally true. However, of course, it will only rarely be relevant to what you are currently doing. In general, the meaning and relevance of a message may vary with the spatial and temporal contexts of its reception. And messages can be classified according to the spatial and temporal contexts they require, as illustrated in the following table. INDEFINITE SPECIFIC TEMPORALLY INDEFINITE TEMPORALLY SPECIFIC Theorem of Pythagoras Stop sign Broadcast sports scores Air traffic controller's command This imposes some requirements on message senders and shapes their technology choices. If you want to send a message that is spatially specific but temporally indefinite, you can inscribe it on a wall, and if you want to send one that is specific to a portable object, you can affix a label. Conversely, if you have a sports score or race result that is of instant interest over a wide area, you can broadcast it. If the message is location specific but varies with time, as with the flight information posted at an airline departure gate, you can use a LED display. If it is spatially and temporally universal, as with a mathematical or scientific result, you might publish it in multiple copies for wide distribution and consultation at indeterminate future dates. If the intended recipient is within sight and earshot, as when you yell to a running child, you do not require any additional technology to assist in achieving spatial and temporal specificity. But if the recipient is out of immediate sensory range\u2014as when an air traffic controller gives instructions to a pilot\u2014some sort of location awareness technology is necessary; specifically, the controller watches the aircraft on a radarscope. In our wirelessly interconnected world, electronic location awareness is becoming commonplace.2 Wireless signals, like sounds, encode information about their sources. By various means, it is possible to discover their directions of origin, and deduce their likely distances. Consequently, the coordinates of portable wireless devices, and of the objects and bodies that bear them, can be tracked.3 Unlike the world of the ancient nomad, the world of the wireless cyborg is inherently one of traceable positions and trajectories. This provides an increasingly crucial new way to weave together cities, their inhabitants, and digital information. You can tag information according to its geographic origin, you can keep track of rela tionships between places and bits, and you wirelessly deliver bits to exactly where they are needed and make sense. Instead of being part of the city\u2019s fixed infrastructure, for example, a stop sign might automatically appear on your dashboard, in response to current traffic conditions, as you drove up to an intersection.4 LOCATION TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES One approach to extracting spatial coordinates is simply to measure the strength and direction of a received signal to get an indication of the transmitter\u2019s distance from you. This is particularly useful if you are searching for a transmitter, since the signal gets stronger as you move toward it. Thus, in a common application, small transmitters in automobiles allow them to be tracked and located when they are stolen. If you are using a cellular system, the cellular operator can keep track of the base stations to which you link as you move around. Measurements of signal strength are used to control switching between base stations. When a call is made or received, the system detects the nearest base station and logs a phone location code in a database. In urban areas with high densities of base stations, this typically establishes location to within a few hundred feet, and also allows approximate motion tracking as mobile callers move from cell to cell. As cellular systems move to higher bandwidths and carry heavier traffic, cells will get smaller and this sort of tracking will become more precise. Another way to get more precise location codes it to measure signal strength at three base stations. This provides sufficient information to compute a location code by triangulation. This will probably be done increasingly as phone location codes are put to more and more practical uses. Phone location codes are, of course, a decidedly mixed blessing. They provide telecommunications companies with billing information and traffic statistics. If available to governments, they can be used for the most chilling kind of comprehensive citizen surveillance, and if available to telemarketers they can be used to direct pinpoint junk mail right to your phone.5 They can also be used by the police and the military for real time tracking of targets; terrorists have learned that cellphone calls may be answered by missiles. More benignly, they allow 911, roadside emergency, and taxi calls to be tagged automatically with caller coordinates. In today\u2019s Dublin, you wouldn\u2019t need a novelist\u2019s omniscience to follow Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Buck Mulligan around the city; you could just track their cellphone usage. And if Leopold could get access to the logs, he could figure out precisely what Molly was up to. Yet another approach is to set up special radio beacons at known locations; wireless equipped travelers can then measure the time taken for signals to reach them from different beacons, convert those times to distances, and thus calculate their current positions by triangulation. This is, of course, a translation of ancient surveying and navigational techniques into wireless processes, and there are many variations on the idea. Loran navigation systems, for example, employ high powered radio beacons at fixed locations. At a smaller scale, some three dimensional digitizers and location trackers make use of ultrasonic beepers and strip microphones. And ultra wideband localizers can now make use of radio frequency (RF) transceivers distributed in the environment to provide centimeter accuracy over kilometer distances.6 THE GPS SYSTEM The most comprehensive and sophisticated infrastructure for wireless location and navigation is provided by the global positioning system (GPS), which was completed, in its original form, by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1994.7 This system derives distances (and hence locations) from the amounts of time taken by radio signals to travel from satellite transmitters to ground based receivers.8 The GPS system is based upon twenty four satellites that circle the earth in a pattern that allows at least five to be seen from any location at any time. Each satellite contains a very precise clock, and the exact position of each satellite is known at any moment. The satellites transmit signals specifying their clock times and locations, and the times taken by these signals to reach a receiver establish the distances of the satellites from the receiver. Four of these signals provide enough information to compute the three dimensional location of the receiver. Remarkably, the system (when it isn\u2019t deliberately made less precise) is accurate to within a few meters\u2014good enough to navigate city streets. It was designed initially for military guidance systems but was soon extended to civilian ships and aircraft as well. By the year 2000, GPS systems were becoming routine equipment in automobiles, and inexpensive pocket sized models were popular equipment for hikers. They were getting built into cellphones to provide more accurate location based 911 capabilities.9 And they were even being incorporated into digital cameras, so that images could be stamped not only with the time of exposure, but also the place. By 2002, single chip GPS systems had been announced\u2014making it possible to integrate GPS capability into devices as small as wristwatches. INDOOR TRACKING Unfortunately, architectural features block GPS signals, so GPS tracking does not work indoors. Beacons located throughout a building can provide similar location tracking capabilities, but the task is complicated by the fact that buildings typically contain metal and other materials that affect the propagation of radio signals, producing interference and dead spots. The Cricket system, developed at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, deals with the difficulty by employing beacons that emit both radio and ultrasonic pulses.10 Since these travel at different speeds, the difference in their arrival time at a receiver can be used to compute distance\u2014much as you can compute the distance of a lightning flash by counting the seconds before you hear the sound of the thunder. By discovering the nearest beacon in this fashion, a location sensitive device can determine which room it is in. In the future, dense grids of inexpensive location beacons will become standard architectural features. These will enable indoor pedestrian navigation in much the same way that GPS supports automobile navigation, and they will allow spaces to advertise the facilities and services that they provide. The experiences of exploring a museum, searching for a product in a department store, or finding your car in a large parking garage will be transformed. RADAR, TRANSPONDERS, AND RF TAGS Radar and sonar tracking stations work in still another way\u2014by bouncing directional signals off moving planes, ships, thunderclouds, and other objects of interest. Conversely, mobile radar and sonar systems in land, sea, and air vehicles bounce signals off the surrounding topography to provide navigational information. The principle may be generalized; anything that propagates a signal into its surrounding environment, from a chirping bat to an 802.11 base station, can potentially employ the reflections of that signal to construct some sort of picture of its environment. Paul Virilio, ever alert to such things, has noted the panoptic potential of ubiquitous broadcasting; he imagines the world\u2019s television and FM radio transmitters organized into a gigantic surveillance engine that \"detects any activity, any movement, legitimate or otherwise.\u201d11 If you embed a transponder in an object, you can go further, and interrogate the object by directing a radio signal at it. Ground stations interrogate transponders in approaching aircraft to determine whether they are friendly or not, and electronic tollbooths interrogate transponders in automobiles to charge tolls. By broadcasting location queries to transponders in GPS equipped vehicles, you can keep constant track of where they are and how fast they are traveling\u2014 a capability of obvious interest to managers of delivery fleets, rental car operators, transportation planners who want traffic flow data, traffic police who want to keep speeding in check, and three letter agencies.12 Early transponders were bulky and expensive, but it is now possible to produce tiny, inexpensive ones on microchips and even to dispense with batteries or external power sources by harnessing the power of the incoming signal. RF tags, based upon this principle, are increasingly being sewn into clothing, embedded in electronic devices, and implanted in both animals and humans.13 We are rapidly approaching the point where anything might respond instantly to a wireless query about its identity, current location, or some other property. A transponder or RF tag might reply with something as simple as an identification number, much like the barcodes that are read by optical scanners. It might directly provide detailed information about its host object, as would a printed label. Less directly, it might provide the URL of a Web site that contained detailed information on its host. And if it is connected to sensors, it can provide current information about its host\u2019s condition; for example, the California Air Resources Board has proposed to equip vehicles with transponders connected to their emissions monitoring systems, so that malfunctioning vehicles automatically identify themselves\u2014the electronic equivalent of a scarlet A on your forehead.14 The most enthusiastic proponents of RFID project a world in which pretty much everything has a smart tag with a unique, 96 bit electronic product code (EPC) that can be read by a simple radio device and used instantly to connect it to the Internet and access an online database that contains the object\u2019s specifications and history\u2014its detailed digital shadow.15 Unlike printed labels, the electronic shadow is of unlimited size and can be dynamically updated. And by contrast with barcodes and readers, RFID is unobtrusive, scanning can be conducted at a distance, and the technology combines gracefully with wireless delivery of information from the Internet. Point a wireless device at an object with an EPC, and you can instantly learn all about it. RFID scanners might also be embedded in warehouse and store shelves for stock control, supermarket and library lanes for automated checkout, and your refrigerator for automated reordering of commodities. Ubiquitous transponders and RFID tags have the potential to efficiently replace other forms of identifying and descriptive information that people and products carry\u2014ID cards, labels, keys, passwords, and the like. Instead of reading a wine label, you might ping the label\u2019s embedded RFID tag to download detailed information from the maker\u2019s Web site to your wireless PDA and apply collaborative filtering to provide a personalized rating and recommendation. Instead of sticking something into a door to open it, you might just walk up, let the door interrogate your implanted RFID tag and check an authorization database, and have it automatically open. But it is also vividly obvious that transponders and tags, combined with location tracking, could open the way to unwanted surveillance\u2014of unprecedented precision, detail, and thoroughness. Since it is unlikely that they will just go away, they create an urgent need for sophisticated identity management systems that allow you to control exactly what you want to reveal about yourself, when you reveal it, and where you do so.16 URBAN INFORMATION OVERLAYS The most profound effect of electronic tracking, inscription, and interrogation techniques is, in combination and on a large scale, to change the fundamental mechanics of reference\u2014the ways in which we establish meaning, construct knowledge, and make sense of our surroundings by associating items of information with one another and with physical objects.17 The simplest way to associate information with physical objects is, of course, to inscribe text or images directly, and more or less permanently, onto their actual surfaces. This is the straightforward strategy of a manufacturer who puts a label on a soup can, a conference organizer who provides nametags, or a monumental mason who erects an inscribed headstone over a grave. It is also that of an architect who provides a directory at the building entrance, direction signs at circulation system intersections, and names on office doors; a visitor sees just what she needs, just where she needs it. For the philosopher\u2014 worried about the subtleties of sense and reference\u2014these are among the elementary classroom cases. Denise Scott Brown noted: \"The flamboyant neon of the Golden Nugget Hotel on Fremont Street has been removed, and on the Strip neon is being replaced by LED or its incandescent equivalents. The moving pixels permit changing imagery and graphics for a multicultural ethos in an information age.\u201d19 But direct inscription\u2014durable or ephemeral, mainstream or marginal, conservative or subversive\u2014is not the only option. You can also associate information with sites and objects by constructing a map, compiling a street directory, or writing a guidebook, and distributing copies to those who may want them. This works particularly well for making cities instantly legible to visitors; as long as they have a few readily recognizable landmarks to orient themselves, they can forget about trying to decode the local sign system and rely upon Lonely Planet, Access, or Zagat. Or if they want to go digital, they can try PDA based city guides such as those provided by Vindigo. The great advantage of these indirect information overlays is that they are nonexclusionary, there may be indefinitely many of them, and individuals can use whichever ones they want. They are always selective, incomplete, biased, and subjective, but there are always alterna tives.20 If Western visitors have maps and guidebooks in their native languages, it does not matter that Tokyo street signs and subway directions are in incomprehensible Kanji. If backpackers have guides to inexpensive accommodations and eating places, and affluent travelers have guides to international hotels and Michelin star restaurants, members of each group can navigate as they wish. If you are straight, you need one guide to Provincetown, if you are gay, another; and if you are adventurous or confused, or just don\u2019t like the construction of these categories, you may want to map it both ways.21 Orientation is crucial, of course. Unless you can pinpoint your current position on a map, and point the map in the right direction, you remain lost. (Or, to put it more philosophically, it is not clear how the detached text in your hand refers to features of the surrounding environment.)22 If you cannot connect that ambiguous ruin in front of you to the correct entry in your Blue Guide, the information that you have in your possession remains frustratingly useless. Even worse, you will retrieve inaccurate information if you don\u2019t get the spatial registration right. You can keep track of your location on a map through some variant on the strategies of sighting recognizable landmarks (such as topographic features, landmark buildings, or stars), watching the time, and keeping careful records of your speed and direction\u2014the elements of the ancient art of navigation. Traditionally, navigators have used compasses, sextants, and chronometers to assist with these tasks. Today, as we have seen, portable electronics are taking over. You can locate yourself on a map or at a relevant guidebook entry by means of GPS or other electronic location techniques. GEOCODED BITS Electronically generated coordinates are obviously useful if you have a map showing a coordinate grid; you can manually pinpoint your current location on the map. But they are even more so if you have access to a geographic information system (GIS)\u2014that is, a database in which the items of information are associated with geographic coordinates.23 You can then use search software to retrieve the items corresponding to your location. One very common form of geographic information system is, in effect, an electronic street map. In the database, street corners and intersections are specified by their coordinates, and streets are described as links between such nodes. Graphic software converts this information into on screen maps, and on request, software can compute shortest paths between specified street addresses. This is the basis of online map and direction systems, such as Mapquest. Combine this sort of GIS with a GPS receiver and you get an automobile navigation system that can continuously show your current location on a map displayed on a dashboard screen, compute the shortest path to your destination, and give you directions.24 Within buildings, facilities management (FM) databases provide digital floor plans, or even three dimensional geometric models, instead of urban scale maps. Typically, FM databases provide information not only about spatial configuration, but also about ownership, use, and condition of interior spaces, associated furniture and equipment, finishes, and services. But street networks and floor plans are by no means the only kind of geocoded content. There is, in fact, a significant industry devoted to creating and maintaining specialized GIS and FM databases for a wide variety of purposes. Urban planners and marketers use GIS systems to map demographic and economic variables, geologists employ them to analyze mineral resources, utilities engineers use them to keep track of pipe and wire locations, and so on. Even more crucially, though, the distinction between specialized GIS databases and Web data in general is fading away; spatial metadata can be usefully associated with just about any Web content, and increasingly this is being done.25 This can even be accomplished automatically, as when a GPS equipped camera associates coordinates with every exposure, so that exposure locations can be plotted immediately on a map, and so that images can be retrieved and sorted spatially. In sum, spatially indexed databases can provide any sort of personalized guidance you may want, through any sort of terrain. And since GIS and FM systems are digital, they can take advantage of capacious storage and efficient retrieval to provide instant access to vast amounts of information. This information may be cached in a vehicle or handheld device if it does not need to be updated too frequently. Or, if it is more dynamic, it may be pumped out continuously from a centrally updated wireless server. (Compare this huge, invisible store of instantly available information to the folded letter concealed in Leopold Bloom\u2019s hatband!) You can sort and filter this information according to your current interests\u2014maybe, for example, using collaborative filtering to recommend and locate restaurants or bookstores on the street you happen to be strolling. Furthermore, on screen maps and plans are not the only sort of output. Automobile guidance systems, for example, can be set to provide sequences of spoken instructions\u2014a particularly useful format when you have to keep your eyes on the road. Guidebook text can be geocoded for spoken output at the appropriate moment; this makes the text perform like an automated tour guide or docent\u2014continually responding, in appropriate and interesting ways, to the current context\u2014rather than a passive repository for looking things up.26 Cities and buildings, like films, might be scored by famous com posers\u2014with the sound track electronically edited, on the fly, as you moved around. And everything of relevance to a particular location (for example, a historic site or a crime scene) might be retrieved and arrayed to provide a comprehensive, electronic mise en scene. Different types of vehicles have different uses for geocoded bits. Shopping carts may trace customers\u2019 steps among the aisles, refer to their purchasing histories, and flash personalized purchase suggestions as they pass the corresponding shelves.27 If you like cornflakes, and you haven\u2019t bought any in a while, you get reminded of that as you roll through the cereal section. Bicycles may respond to your current exercise requirements, routing you up hills or away from them, depending upon your instructions. GIS and FM systems, spatial metadata, and associated technologies have mostly escaped the attention of social theorists and cultural critics.28 They sound boring, and the large literature associated with them is mostly nuts and bolts technical. But don\u2019t be fooled; they represent the beginnings of an important new relationship between information and inhabited space\u2014one that will become increasingly prominent as the wireless world evolves. Bits will increasingly be tagged with coordinates, and the digital doppelgangers of cities will be closely registered to their physical counterparts. RETHINKING ACCESS This emerging cross linkage of the digital and physical domains allows us to rethink one of the traditional functions of a city\u2014that of minimizing the time and effort its inhabitants must spend in locating and accessing resources and one another. Usually cities accomplish this through a combination of physical design strategies\u2014high density, efficient transportation, and legible layout that reduces obscurity and confusion\u2014with signposting, maps, and directories. Because urban configurations are relatively stable, inhabitants can, over time, build up mental maps that efficiently guide them to what they want. Information storage and retrieval systems, such as relational database systems or the World Wide Web, similarly seek to minimize search time, and make use of indexing, pointers, and efficient sorting and searching procedures to do so. The terrains and the means of traversal are different, but in each case the goals are much the same. Now, as a result of cross linkage, strategies of urban designers and database hackers are converging. Not so long ago, the inhabitants of cities physically searched for physical things, and electronically surfed for online information. Today, in addition, they may employ physical exploration and location sensitive devices to get to geocoded digital information and take advantage of electronic guidance to assist in efficient location of physical things\u2014from stolen automobiles to tourist attractions. Furthermore, an appropriately programmed location sensitive device can usefully reason about spatial and temporal information. If it knows your current location and your goal, it can compute the shortest path and cheapest path for you. If it knows the public transportation system schedules and fares, it can figure out the best way for you to go. If it knows your interests and time constraints, it can personalize tours for you. If it knows whom you want to meet, it can find and arrange a mutually convenient meeting place and, if necessary, help you to recognize each other. If it knows your schedule, your location, and the time, it can keep constant track of whether you are where you are supposed to be and discreetly remind you when it\u2019s time to leave for the next place. SPATIAL REGISTRATION GPS powered, GIS driven automobile navigation systems maintain a consistent relationship between the dashboard map and the surrounding terrain by keeping the map pointed in the right direction and keeping the vehicle\u2019s current location roughly in the map\u2019s center. The video displays provided to airline passengers, keeping them informed about progress toward their destinations, employ a similar strategy. This is a simple but effective way of registering computed information with the physical world\u2014that is, of unambiguously associating it with the physical objects to which it refers. A more sophisticated technique is to provide a heads up display on the windshield. This superimposes graphic and textual information on the scene ahead, like virtual annotation or signage. And of course you no longer have to look down at the dashboard. So far, this sort of display has mostly been used in military aircraft (where looking down can be a particularly serious problem), but it is likely to become increasingly common in other types of vehicles. The handheld or wearable equivalent of this is the see through display, incorporated in a high tech monocle, spectacles, field glasses, or a camera viewfinder. One type of see through display is built around a miniature flat panel of light valves or light emitting elements. Another makes use of a retinal scanning display; a pulsed beam from a low powered laser diode is bounced off a tiny moving mirror, directed into the eye, and thus rapidly scanned across the retina.29 Point an appropriately programmed see through display at an object of interest, and it will tell you all about it. Maybe, as well, it will automatically add the commentary to a photo or video. The very best spatial registration can be produced (in principle, at least) by combining accurate head tracking with stereo see through goggles and a three dimensional geometric model of the terrain. The result is a so called \u201caugmented reality\u201d system.30 The technical challenges of accurate head tracking and spatial registration, and of constructing comfortable and unobtrusive see through goggles, are formidable. But augmented reality systems elegantly combine the advantages of direct and indirect inscription and have many potential uses. They might, for example, be incorporated into \u201csmart hard hats,\u201d and provide construction workers with x ray vision of hidden utilities and structural elements. And construction drawings could be replaced by full scale, correctly registered, three dimensional \u201cmodels in the air\u201d to guide layout and on site assembly of construction components. Different contexts and purposes demand spatial registration of information in different ways and with different levels of precision. If you want to retrieve information about local weather or traffic conditions, accuracy to within a few kilometers is all you need. For the motorist, a correctly oriented and updated dashboard map, with accuracy to a few meters, may suffice for street navigation. For a construction worker, who must keep hands free and perform assembly operations with millimeter precision, a very high quality, head mounted augmented reality system may be necessary. In any case, spatial registration combined with geocoding takes texts, images, and sounds from free floating locations on pages and in storage devices and binds them to specific spatial and temporal set tings. It dynamically overlays labels, commentaries, instructions, and abstractions on the physical objects, people, and places to which they refer, supplying precisely what the World Wide Web does not\u2014 context. Instead of the precession of simulacra that Jean Baudrillard promoted onto the cultural studies agenda in the 1980s,31 you get site specific installations of bits\u2014hybrid constructions in which digital information adds a layer of meaning to a physical setting, and the physical setting helps to establish the meaning of the digital information. This adjoins a new dimension to architecture, and creates new opportunities for assertion of facts, construction of fictions, and insinuation of falsehoods. ELECTRONIC MEMORY PALACES Cicero, no doubt, would have loved all this. In De oratore he observed that orderly arrangement of information is essential to its memorization and that architectural space could effectively provide this arrangement. He illustrated the point with the tale of the poet Simonides, who remembered exactly where guests had been sitting at a banquet when the roof of the hall collapsed, mangling them all beyond recognition. Cicero went on: He inferred that persons desiring to train this faculty (of memory) must select places and form mental images of the things they wish to remember and store those images in the places, so that the order of the places will preserve the order of the things, and the images of the things will denote the things themselves, and we shall employ the places and images respectively as a wax writing tablet and the letters written on it.32 This was the mythic origin of mnemotechnics\u2014the art of memory\u2014by means of which ancient orators could deliver long speeches from memory. Frances Yates has summarized the procedure, as described in detail by Quintilian: In order to form a series of places in memory, he says, a building is to be remembered, as spacious and varied a one as possible, the forecourt, the living room, the bedrooms, and parlors, not omitting statues and other ornaments with which the rooms are decorated. The images by which the speech is to be remembered\u2014as an example of these Quintilian says one may use an anchor or a weapon\u2014are then placed in imagination on the places which have been memorized in the building. This done, as soon as the memory of the facts requires to be revived, all these places are visited in turn and the various deposits demanded of their custodians. We have to think of the ancient orator as moving in imagination through his memory building whilst he is making his speech, drawing from the memorized places the images he has placed on them.33 In today\u2019s emerging electronic mnemotechnics, information is stored in digital devices rather than heads, it is associated with physical places through geocoding, it may be retrieved by actually moving from place to place, and it may be presented in multimedia format on devices such as see through video displays and audio earpieces.34 In this fashion, a whole city becomes a vast, collectively constructed memory palace that divulges its contents to inhabitants as they circulate through it. BITS COME HOME Long ago (somewhere around 1995), as today\u2019s digitally networked world was big banging into existence, it sometimes seemed that cyberspace might imitate, improve upon, and ultimately supplant physical space as the place to be. Point and click interfaces to personal computers were luminous replicas of physical desktops. Virtual communities represented themselves on screen as cozy little villages\u2014 nicer, less problematic places than the neighborhoods most of us bodily inhabited. Among designers, CAD systems and digital models were rapidly replacing physical media. Computer graphics researchers, in a SIGGRAPH by SIGGRAPH progression that recalled the development of Western painting from Masaccio to Manet, sought ever more photorealistic renditions of physical scenes\u2014maybe moviemakers would no longer need real actors and sets. Videogames and virtual reality environments were populated with humanoid avatars and three dimensional models of familiar physical objects. Cyberpunk novelists imagined shucking your messy flesh for a perfected virtual body and dwelling among the pixels. The Internet, we were assured, changed everything\u2014distance was dead, the economy was weightless. Maybe (in a new twist on ancient yearning to transcend corporeality) we would live forever in reliably engineered silicon. But at a more structural level, a complementary transformation was stealthily taking hold; physical space was acquiring many of the crucial characteristics of cyberspace. Material things, with embedded computation and communication capabilities, were starting to function like on screen graphic objects; poke them or move them, and you got some computational result. Through location tracking, physical artifacts could report where they were, much like cursors in screen coordinate systems. Through wireless communication, bodies, places, and devices could be as densely, continuously, and seamlessly interconnected as Web pages. Online information\u2014no matter where it physically resided\u2014could show up wherever and whenever you needed it. By the time the dot com bubble burst and splattered, it was clear that physical space and cyberspace had actually become locked in an intricate, mutually transforming embrace, with functions shifting and dividing between the two in complex ways. By the early 2000s, bits had returned from cyberspace. They had gone on location in the material world. 8 FOOTLOOSE FABRICATION We produce the artifacts we want by bringing together designs, energy, and materials\u2014all of which may be delivered to the production site, from a distance, through networks. When you bake a cake in your kitchen, for example, you follow a recipe that may have arrived through the mail, you apply thermal energy that was most likely supplied in the form of piped gas, and you combine ingredients transported from around the world through a variety of transportation networks. When you laser print a piece of artwork in your office, the design arrives over a computer network, the electricity to activate the print mechanism is supplied by the grid, and the paper and toner cartridges (the weak link in this web) probably arrived by truck. Very few artifacts are produced directly, at one location, from natural raw materials. Most are in fact put together from other artifacts; in other words, they emerge, through multistep processes, from supply networks. The nodes of these networks are sites at which materials are organized, according to some design, through the controlled application of energy. Today\u2014notably, for example, in the fabrication and assembly of electronic components\u2014these networks may extend globally, and production usually requires careful timing and coordination of parallel activities at multiple sites. In the era of craft production, multiple fabrication and assembly tasks were performed sequentially, at one location, in the craftsman\u2019s shop\u2014a strategy celebrated, for example, by William Morris. Industrialization sought the advantages of division of labor, specialization, and parallel processes; industrial assembly lines form transportation networks linking sites of specialized tasks. In today\u2019s network era, enhanced transportation and telecommunication capabilities allow greater spatial division of labor and, in effect, the expansion of assembly lines from factory to global scale. If you are a twenty first century producer, you don\u2019t just manage plants, you manage complex supply networks. DECENTRALIZED PRODUCTION When the machines that bring designs, energy, and materials together at nodes in supply networks are bulky, heavy, and expensive (as with high speed printing presses and CD burners), there are few of them, and their locations tend to be fixed. They are potential bottlenecks in the flow of production. Furthermore, as robber baron capitalists and Marxist revolutionaries knew equally well, they provide opportunities to acquire political power by grabbing the means of production. But when miniaturization allows the development and proliferation of small, inexpensive production devices (such as laser printers), redundancy can be introduced into supply networks. Production can often be decentralized and even mobilized. Under these conditions, political power can be distributed (and centralized power can be subverted) by producing such devices in quantity and spreading them around. Consider, for example, the evolution of the supply networks through which the humble ice cube cometh. The frozen water trade began, on a large scale, with the harvesting of big blocks of ice from New England lakes and rivers by means of ice plows.1 Increasingly efficient long distance bulk transportation networks made this possible. Blocks were stored in huge icehouses near the rural harvest points, transported by sailing ship to cities as distant as Calcutta, stored again in urban icehouses, and eventually distributed by ice cart to domestic iceboxes. By the 1880s large, steam driven artificial ice plants were becoming competitive\u2014particularly in warm locations far from the sources of natural ice; these depended upon water supply, energy supply, and local delivery networks, and they were a first step in decentralization of ice production. Then came electric supply networks, small electric motors, the invention of sealed container refrigeration, and mass produced domestic refrigerators. Ice production had been a centralized industrial activity, but by the 1950s it had fragmented and recombined with domestic space. Today small, automated ice makers are nodes in domestic electrical and plumbing networks, and bitesized ice cubes pop out of your refrigerator door; the distance from production point to your glass has shortened from thousands of kilometers to a few centimeters. Limits on network capacity, costs of transporting things through networks, and the losses incurred in transportation also play roles in establishing the relative advantages of centralized and decentralized production. Steelworks are often concentrated near sources of iron ore and coal, for example, since it is more expensive to transport these commodities over long distances than to transport the less bulky finished products. Ice plants were located near ice markets, since ice gradually melted during transportation. And the mills of the early industrial era were clustered around sites of water or steam power, since production machines had to be within range of the belts and other mechanical means that were used for transmitting power. But when the crucial networks become ubiquitous and efficient, as with modern electrical grids and the Internet, the importance of distance correspondingly diminishes; it hardly matters where you plug in a PC to download and print a document from a Web server. These effects are most pronounced, and perhaps most threatening to established industries, when mobilized, easily replicable software transforms large numbers of Internet nodes into a highly redundant, geographically dispersed, production and distribution system. Thus when music industry lawyers tried to shut down the KaZaA peer to peer file sharing system, they found that the developers were living in the Netherlands, the programmers were in Estonia, the location of the source code was unknown, the distributor was based in Australia but incorporated in Vanuatu, and installations were scattered over 60 million Internet users in 150 countries.2 In the long run, the established music industry had about as much chance as the New England ice harvesters. PERSONALIZED PRODUCTION Traditionally, industrial production has sought scale economies. To compete effectively, industrialists built big, fast machines that turned out long runs of standard products at the lowest possible cost. (The higher the investments in this machinery, the more intensively it had to be used.) But decentralized, personal production is more concerned with personalization\u2014that is, with smaller runs of products that may be more expensive but are more precisely adapted to the specific requirements of particular contexts. It is the difference between a high speed newspaper press and your personal laser printer. You can provide for customization by equipping a production device with lots of knobs and dials. A really good manual camera, for example, is festooned with gadgets you can adjust and set, and provides a photographer with extraordinary control of the subtle qualities of images. A point and shoot camera, by contrast, efficiently produces a highly standardized product and, since it doesn\u2019t have to provide so many external control points, is usually a smaller, cleaner, and simpler looking object. As production devices have acquired embedded intelligence, a new possibility has emerged; you can control (or hack) them by sending them streams of bits. So your laser printer can produce different pages, and your MP3 player can produce different sounds, depending upon the digital input. At another level, if you have the programming skills, you can mess with the resident code that interprets such input\u2014so altering the types of products that are output. At more industrial scales, numerically controlled (NC) production machinery has gradually been taking over from older, more cumbersome, manually controlled devices. At first, NC machinery was driven by paper tape; now it is run directly by computers. The shift to NC reduces setup costs and the need for close manual control and so allows production of varied output without crippling cost penalties. Thus a numerically controlled laser cutter can efficiently produce highly varied shapes from sheet material, and a numerically controlled deposition printer can produce three dimensional solids. By the 1990s this shift was vividly being reflected in architecture; buildings like Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao were no longer constructed from the simple, repeating components that had characterized construction in the industrial era, but from complex, CAD/CAM fabricated, nonrepeating elements.3 As inexpensive, digitally controlled production devices have been networked, it has become possible to download designs from distant servers, maybe tweak and customize them as required, then produce them locally. So increasingly it makes sense to distribute designs through telecommunication networks rather than finished products through transportation networks and to produce customized physical artifacts on demand, wherever and whenever they might be needed. Fax machines provided an early, modest intimation of this new logic of decentralized, customized, production at a distance. At the transmission end they begin by harvesting text and images\u2014 the graphic design that is to be reproduced at a distance\u2014from paper sheets. They encode and send this information electronically, at high speed. At the reception end, they reinscribe it on new paper sheets. When you fax a document you don\u2019t actually perform the miracle of teleporting a sheet of printed paper, but the effect is the same. A good Platonist would know just how to describe the process. You separate an object\u2019s form from its material, transmit the dematerialized form, and eventually reembody the form with new but indistinguishable material. You dematerialize, then rematerialize. You keep the bits constant, but substitute new atoms. Even more dramatically, since laser printers have become commonplace, vast quantities of textual and graphic material are now stored on servers, downloaded anywhere there is a network connection, and printed out on demand. The distribution system for printed documents has, in effect, bifurcated; instead of printing documents at a central location then distributing information and paper bonded together, the idea is to distribute blank paper and ink as inexpensive commodities and to distribute information separately via highly efficient electronic channels. In many contexts, particularly where the numbers of copies are small or the information is frequently updated, the efficiencies of this distribution strategy far outweigh the economies of scale realized through centralized high speed printing. This has, of course, crucial implications for publishers, book retailers, and libraries. Ever since the industrial revolution gave us high speed presses, books have been produced in bulk at central factory locations, stored (at high cost) in warehouses, distributed to retailers who store them again on their shelves, and finally delivered to libraries and consumers. This system makes it expensive and difficult to keep titles in print for long periods and to distribute books effectively to remote corners of the world. Furthermore, lots of books are distributed to retailers only to remain unsold, eventually to be returned to the publishers and pulped. Now, however, it is feasible to store books in electronic form on servers rather than in print form in warehouses, to download them on demand to point of sale book machines, and to print and bind them on the spot.4 And the potential of new print technology does not end there. At MIT\u2019s Media Laboratory, Joe Jacobson and his research group have prototyped the idea of a \"desktop fab.\u201d5 The idea is to print logic chips, electronic tags, MEMS devices, and the like on inexpensive substrates such as paper or plastic using \"ink\u201d consisting of nanometer sized particles. Instead of purchasing standard electronic components that were produced in billion dollar specialized facilities, you might download and print your own\u2014much as you now download software. A NEW LOGIC OF PRODUCTION As a result of decentralized, customized, production at a distance, supply networks are destabilized and transformed, and they demand rethinking. From an economist\u2019s perspective, for example, a chain through a supply network progressively adds value to materials\u2014 going, for example, from water to ice cube, sand to a silicon chip, or electronic components to fully assembled computer. Traditionally, the sequence has been one of design, component fabrication, assembly, warehousing, retailing, and eventually disposal or recycling. Now the producer\u2019s crucial assets may be designs residing on servers rather than completed products in warehouses, and these designs may be applied to add value to materials at multiple, decentralized production points of fluid and often indeterminate location, rather than at fixed, centralized industrial sites. From a designer\u2019s perspective, the process is one of progressively binding design decisions to materials. At each stage, designers are constrained by the ways in which variables were bound at earlier stages. Thus if I assemble a design out of Lego blocks, I am constrained by the predefined geometry of my components; if I assemble an electronic system out of standard chips, I am constrained by the earlier decisions of circuit designers; and if I assemble an order for personalized sneakers online, I work within a tightly bounded range of sneaker features and their combinations.6 But we are now moving from early binding of design variables to late binding. As a designer working with a networked, digitally controlled production device, I can select the design to download and customize it to my circumstances by choosing values for parameters at the very last moment before impressing it upon materials. It matters little whether the digital master files that increasingly control decentralized production of material and acoustic artifacts are generated by processes of scanning, recording, and otherwise capturing existing physical reality, whether they are constructed directly by means of text, music, or CAD editing software, or whether they are complex hybrids. In a digitally controlled world, Nelson Goodman\u2019s hitherto telling distinction between autographic and allographic production collapses. Every artifact has a digital script, score, or plan, and every production process is an automated performance. Creation of the script, score, or plan may look like composition (taking place in meticulous, step by step fashion, using some sort of editing software) or more like recording a performance\u2014with the operations executed at high speed, using specialized instruments and interfaces. And this produces a curious new category of art objects. Under conditions of craft production, art objects are unique. We value their direct connection to the hand of the artist, and we care about provenance; they possess the quality that Walter Benjamin famously termed \"aura.\u201d7 Under conditions of mechanical reproduction, there is a distinction between an original (an oil painting by Vermeer, for example) and its copies, such as the postcards for sale in the museum store\u2014a mass audience consumes these aura challenged, industrially produced commodities. But under conditions of materialization on demand from a digital file, there need be no original; new material instances may be produced at any time, and instances may differ widely from one another\u2014for example, by being produced at different scales, at different resolutions, or with different materials. MUTABILITY, RECOMBINATION, AND NAPSTERIZATION The shift to decentralized, digitally mastered production is inexorably eroding structures of authority that had been sustained by mutually supportive strategies of productizing intellectual and artistic work, industrializing mass production, and legally controlling replication processes. The debate buzzing around this transformation has mostly been cast in terms of ownership of intellectual property, payment, copying, and reuse rights.8 It has pitted the aggressive lawyers of large entertainment and publishing companies against libraries, academics, and defenders of the public interest in the areas of fair use and unrestricted access. But maybe even more fundamentally, the debate is also about preserving the stability, identity, and closure of intellectual products versus the possibility of creative transformation and recombination. If you purchase a CD from a record store, for example, you get the set of performances that the record producer has chosen to bundle together\u2014no more, no less\u2014whether you want them all or not. But if you rip all your CDs, and store the MP3s on your hard drive, you can group and sequence performances in any way you want.9 And if you download MP3s from Napster or one of its successors, you gain even more freedom. This breaks down the unity of the CD while preserving the integrity of recorded performances, but the musical strategy of sampling takes the process a step further. The sampler employs digital editing technology to appropriate fragments of musical material from multiple sources, transform them, and recombine them to produce new works. This is an innovative and artistically vital practice but, under the usual rules of industrial era copyright, it is treading on dangerous legal ground. Artists get away with it only so long as the appropriated fragments are not copyrighted by aggressive holders, not overly large, and not too recognizable after transformation. If their compositions turn out to be profitable enough to make it worthwhile, they are likely to find themselves pursued by IP sharks. Print publishers, like record companies bundling tracks on CDs, have traditionally grouped texts into issues of magazines and journals and into bound hardback and paperback volumes. In addition to its efficiencies and pricing advantages, this provided a convenient framework for branding; it was advantageous to have your work come out under the imprint of a well regarded publisher or to have your article published in a prestigious journal in the company of the established intellectual elite. The photocopier first challenged this strategy by enabling ready reproduction of pages, articles, and chapters, and the recombination of these extracts into new, ad hoc collections such as course readers. With digital text, the logic of the database replaced that of the printed page. Publishers of online journals discovered that rigid subdivision of material into \"issues\u201d no longer made much sense. Large, searchable text databases like LexisNexis aggregated articles from numerous sources and supported retrieval by user specified category, and the World Wide Web cross connected huge structures of text with hyperlinks. For a century and a half photographers, using the silver based process, have captured complete images with definite spatial and temporal coordinates. The privileged role of the photographic image as reliable visual evidence has depended upon its wholeness and closure and the possibility of tracing it back to an unambiguous origin point. But digital cameras now decompose images into finite grids of pixels that may readily be sampled and recombined to produce seamless collages. Furthermore, digital images\u2014both captured and synthetic\u2014 may be replicated indefinitely and endlessly circulated through the Internet. Distinctions among visual facts, falsehoods, and fictions are increasingly difficult to construct and sustain.10 From the perspective of architects, Napsterization is the culmination of a long process of mobilizing and recombining design information. It began with the use of portable templates to facilitate replication of standard shapes and profiles in buildings. With the emergence of print, architects began to publish descriptions of architectural elements and rules for their combination; great classical treatises, from Palladio\u2019s Four Books to Guadet\u2019s Elements and Theory, disseminated standardized languages of architectural form.11 We are now entering an era in which descriptions of elements and rules are stored on servers as software objects, traded, varied, and recombined electronically, and eventually materialized by means of CAD/CAM production devices.12 If Palladio were alive today, he would be looking to 3D digital modeling and peer to peer distribution technology, not to woodcuts of plans and elevations. MODULARITY AND PORTABILITY You can trade and recombine MP3 files, digital images, CAD models, and the like because they are modular; that is, they are standard units in consistent format. (If an MP3 player gets a file that isn\u2019t in this format, it won\u2019t open it.) More technically, the differences among MP3 files are hidden behind a layer of abstraction that allows them to be handled in a uniform way. Over time, computing environments have evolved increasingly sophisticated layers of abstraction, providing greater modularity, easier reuse, and enhanced capacity to recombine digital fragments into new structures. In the 1960s, on the batch processing computers of the time, you could assemble Fortran programs by duplicating decks of cards encoding functions and subroutines, then shuffling them into desired sequences; rubber bands, sorting machines, duplicating machines, and cardboard boxes were important aids in this process. Similarly, data files were decks of cards terminated by punched end of file symbols. If you wanted to modify a line of code or a data record (to correct a typo, for example) you physically pulled a card and replaced it. But this was cumbersome, and furthermore, mutually incompatible compilers established strong \"trade barriers\u201d among computing subcultures centered on different machines. By the 1970s, though, things had become much easier; at the terminals of timesharing mainframe systems, you could use simple filesharing systems, online function and subroutine libraries, and text editors to assemble and run programs (maybe in Lisp) electronically. Then local area networks, the Arpanet, and the Internet further facilitated sharing, reuse, and recombination of code\u2014and provided fertile ground for development of the collaborative \"hacker\u201d culture. Meanwhile, programming languages and software engineering practices evolved to support creation of modular, portable, reusable code units rather than huge, monolithic software constructions of the past; in particular, languages like C++ enabled creation of highly modular software \"objects,\u201d development of sharable object libraries, and use of convenient mechanisms, such as inheritance, to facilitate modification and combination of existing objects to produce new objects. Eventually, as networked computing environments became standard, languages like Java combined the virtues of modularity with easy network distribution and ability to run immediately in just about any computing environment. At a technical level, there was now little to inhibit global free trade in software modules. Of course, though, you might still choose to inhibit such trade by deliberately introducing incompatibilities, or to erect security barriers against ill behaved code you wouldn\u2019t want invading your machine. Modularized, parameterized, mobilized software has enabled several competing production and distribution strategies. For example, the neo Fordist, industrial strategy\u2014as pursued by Microsoft and other large software firms\u2014emphasizes organized division of labor, accumulation of corporate intellectual property, integration of as many functions as possible into a single, standard, product, closure and protection of that product (the source code is not available to users), branding, and market domination. By contrast, the open source strategy\u2014most vividly illustrated by the development of the Linux operating system\u2014takes advantage of the creativity and enlightened self interest of user communities to create shared intellectual capital.13 In an open source production environment, source code is made freely available, users extend and modify it as appropriate to their particular needs and priorities, and contribute generally useful extensions and modifications to a common pool. Most radical of all (and, so far, of least practical impact\u2014though I would not bet against it in the long term) is the evolutionary strategy. In so called \"simulated evolution,\u201d software modules randomly mutate, they are evaluated by some specified fitness function, and according to their fitness values, they either survive in the common pool or are discarded.14 All of these strategies can work well under the right circumstances, and they can work in various combinations and flavors; the commonality is reliance on modular, malleable, mobile, electronic text as the enabling medium. These network enabled strategies of decentralized collaging, sampling, searching and exchanging, and open sourcing threaten established corporate approaches to creating, pricing, marketing, and protecting information products. Not surprisingly then, corporate interests have often resisted and even attempted to criminalize them.15 Disney, Time Warner, Microsoft, and Reed Elsevier would have it that the value of digital information derives from easy distribution and wide consumer access to completed, packaged, impregnably encrypted and copyrighted intellectual products. But far greater societal value resides in its endless capacity for fluid adaptation, transformation, and recombination, within communities of interest, to produce new and unexpected outcomes. If publishers and record companies succeed in enforcing continuation of outdated, industrial age norms and conventions into the network era, many of the advantages of free flowing, readily recombinable digital information will be lost. The cultural cost will be enormous. This applies not only to pure information products, but also to material products formed through the application of information. The binding of form to materials has been loosened. We are entering an era in which batches of material may readily inhabit different forms, and digitally specified forms may inhabit different materials. In sum, we have to rethink Manufacturing 101 and reconsider strategies for controlling the means of production. We may still be a long way from the superhero nano ring or the future wittily extrapolated in Neal Stephenson\u2019s The Diamond Age \u2014a world in which every household has \"the feed,\u201d a nanopipeline that supplies atoms to matter compilers that produce whatever goods you need on demand\u2014but conditions have fundamentally changed.16 What now matters most is not having an inventory of valuable things in your possession, nor even the machinery needed to produce such an inventory, but access to the invisible, immaterial, digital specifications. It is all very Platonic, in a way; digitally encoded ideas exist somewhere in cyberspace, and physical artifacts are their imperfect, material realizations. 9 POST SEDENTARY SPACE Antonello da Messina\u2019s famous picture of Saint Jerome in his study shows how the attachment of atoms, in the most literal way, adds inertia to information.1 It depicts the scholar surrounded and encumbered by his heavyweight personal information environment; he pores over a manuscript on the inclined desk before him, and his precious accumulation of books, papers, and writing instruments is gathered around, within the enclosure of his room. It is a tightly bounded assemblage of physical materials at a particular location. If he wants to keep it at hand, rather than rely upon fallible memory, its bulk and mass tightly tether him to that particular place. Dilbert wasn\u2019t so different. Like most office workers of the 1980s and 1990s, he occupied a cube containing a PC.2 His information environment was more digital than paper\u2014some of it residing on his local disk, and some of it on distant servers. Although he did not need physical proximity to the servers, he still had to be near the delivery point. He was as tied to his computer as Saint Jerome had been to his bookshelves. Furthermore, his telephone was physically attached to the cubicle; you could only call him when he was in. In other words, desktop computers, telephones, and wired networks provided fixed points of presence. These favored points were like oases in a digital information desert; they were powerful attractors of human presence and activity. The cubicle farms of the era were grids of such points. As networks became faster and more sophisticated, and as more and more information moved from local storage to servers, it ceased to matter which cubicle Dilbert occupied. He could log in from wherever he happened to be in the building, and he could have his calls electronically redirected. This was good for the boss, who could make more efficient use of his stock of cubicle space by shuffling cubicle dwellers around at will, but it did not help Dilbert\u2019s quality of life. He still had to be at some point of presence, and the new cube to cube mobility gave him even less opportunity to personalize his surroundings. But wireless connections and portable access devices create continuous fields of presence that may extend throughout buildings, outdoors, and into public space as well as private. This has profound implications for the locations and spatial distributions of all human activities that depend, in some way, upon access to information. FIELDS OF PRESENCE By selectively loosening place to place contiguity requirements, wired networks produced fragmentation and recombination of familiar building types and urban patterns.3 For example, the local bank or branch bank largely disappeared in the early digital era; it was replaced by more decentralized access points distributed throughout the city\u2014 that is, ATM machines and electronic home banking on desktop computers, combined with centralized back office facilities and call centers that provided economies of scale. Similarly, by selectively loosening person to place contiguity requirements, wireless networks and portable devices have created an additional degree of spatial indeterminacy; you can now electronically \"home\u201d bank from a wireless laptop, and if you can rely upon credit cards, debit cards, or some form of electronic cash, you never need to go looking for an ATM location. From the customer\u2019s perspective, banking no longer has any particular place in the city. In the short lived dot com era, Amazon and other online retailers fragmented and recombined retail functions and provided an alternative to stores and malls; you would order goods online, and they would be delivered from a warehouse to your home or office. Thus the retail store functions of advertising and enticement, browsing, and completing the sale transaction were fragmented and dispersed, while the functions of storage and dispatch of stock were highly centralized at monster box (often national) distribution centers that offered economies of scale, and back office functions\u2014supported by e commerce technology\u2014could be located just about anywhere. This turned out to work well for compact, high value items like books and electronics, but for dog food, delivery costs were a killer. Now, wireless fields of presence are beginning to provide yet another alternative\u2014one that returns advantage to highly differentiated, place based retailers. Location based advertising, maybe combined with electronic urban navigation, can tell you the nearest point of availability of some specialized thing that you want\u2014such as a funghi porcini risotto at a good Italian restaurant\u2014and guide you to it. If you think of shopping as a search for scarce or specialized (maybe unique) things that are to be found at particular locations in a city, then wirelessly delivered, dynamically updated, location specific information can greatly increase the efficiency of that search. Location based advertising can also guide you to scarce commodities available at dynamically varying locations, such as urban parking spaces and unoccupied machines in laundry rooms. This can be integrated with sensor networks; you can embed inexpensive, carsensing devices in parking stalls, and use monitors in washers and dryers. For example, eSuds has networked washers and dryers in college dorms; when machines are available, and when they have completed their cycles, they send out email and pager messages. Some activities, such as stock trading and gambling on horse races, depend upon highly time sensitive information. Before highspeed telecommunication, this meant that you had to be right at the site of production of that information\u2014the stock exchange floor or the racetrack, for example. If you were distant, you might still participate, but you would be disadvantaged by information transmission delays; conversely, as James Joyce\u2019s get rich quick, wireless aided scheme for betting on the English races illustrated, you might gain advantage by shortening those delays. With telecommunication, and electronic information and transaction services, the action began to shift to distributed points of presence; we saw the decline (and sometimes disappearance) of centralized exchanges and clusters of bookies on the rails, accompanied by the rise of electronic trading floors, day trading at PCs, and off track betting shops. Today, even those distributed sites are no longer technically necessary\u2014though they may sometimes be preserved by regulators who want to confine activities to particular locations; trading and gambling can readily shift to wireless, portable devices. Yet other activities have begun to depend upon clandestine, wirelessly distributed information and indeterminate locations. Where prostitution is legal (or at least tolerated), for example, brothels and red light districts can be at fixed, well known, maybe even advertised locations; where it is frowned upon, and telecommunication is not readily available, you get mobile streetwalkers; and where a wired telephone network is available, you get call girl operations\u2014effectively mobilizing and distributing the actual sites of service but leaving the headquarters vulnerable to raids. But where clients, pimps, and sex workers have access to pagers, cellphones, and instant messaging, locations are temporary, mobile, and indeterminate. It becomes much harder to regulate the sex industry\u2014and to protect workers. Drug dealers have also learned the advantages of continuous fields of presence. Where they can rely sufficiently upon fortification, intimidation, and paying off the cops, they can distribute from crack houses. If a neighborhood has plenty of public telephones, they can arrange more dispersed transactions through those\u2014but the authorities may stake out or simply remove telephones. When they have pagers and cellphones, though, dealers can stay highly mobile, take orders wherever they happen to be, and deliver at ad hoc locations\u2014 dropping rocks from an SUV and using foot action for ziplock baggies of weed. In response, during the 1990s many schools banned wireless electronic devices.4 Pornographers, as they always managed with new technology, have been particularly fast on their feet. Photography and print facilitated the production of pornography but generated a distribution problem; the obvious, site specific option of a porn store was vulnerable to busts and shakedowns, might embarrass the customers, and might be resisted by neighbors. Pornographers quickly turned to the smut magazine format, the mail, and plain brown wrappers, but they still had to contend with mail regulators and customs officials. (Even today, don\u2019t try smuggling skin pix into Saudi.) They swiftly took advantage of the Internet, offshore servers, encryption, and anonymous remailers, but the authorities immediately countered by raiding server locations and looking for downloaded nasties on PC hard drives. Now it is possible to create highly redundant, decentralized, peer to peer porn networks (that is, to Napsterize smut), and to distribute to wireless devices at mobile locations. As broadband wireless develops, delivery of high resolution pornographic images and videos (maybe captured live by wireless camera/transmitters) will undoubtedly be a killer app. Skeptics about wireless networks like to emphasize that wireless merely provides the last link in a telecommunication infrastructure that is, in fact, mostly wired. Furthermore, it is a relatively unreliable and inefficient link. They are right, but they completely miss the point. As these examples illustrate, for good or ill, continuous fields of presence provided by wireless networks can fundamentally alter patterns of resource availability and space use. REMOBILIZING SERVICES The simplest of transportation networks allowed itinerant poets and scholars to visit communities and doctors to make house calls. However, as educational and medical services increasingly depended upon accumulations of specialized equipment, supplies, and expertise, they were centralized at large scale, purpose built facilities\u2014particu larly modern schools, university campuses, and hospitals. Sometimes students and patients became long term inmates of these facilities, sometimes they visited them on regular schedules (school days and school hours), sometimes they went by appointment, and sometimes they made emergency visits\u2014but always they had to remove themselves from the contexts of their communities and enter particularized environments to access the services they needed. The ivory tower and the magic mountain came to symbolize this system\u2019s reliance upon separation, the invigilated exam room and the Nurse Ratchet its engagement with structures of control. Throughout the twentieth century, educational and medical complexes (sometimes combined) grew and coevolved with urban networks. Sometimes they were simply concentrations of specialized facilities within the urban fabric, as at University College London or New York University, and sometimes they were discrete, clearly bounded, even walled and gated campuses. Increasingly extensive transportation networks enabled them to serve larger populations, provided their personnel with access to housing, and encouraged them to take advantage of scale to develop specializations. They evolved into major urban elements and important nodes in transportation networks. The UCLA campus, at the edge of the Los Angeles basin, may be the mature masterpiece of the genre; there is a pretty piazza at the center, the pavilions of the arts and humanities occupy the green and hilly northern end, big footprint medical and engineering buildings cluster at the more urban southern end, and the perimeter is defined by a ring road studded with huge parking structures and card key access points. Daily commuters converge on campus from throughout the basin, the San Fernando Valley to the north, and Orange County to the south. The Arpanet\u2014which, fittingly enough, first took root at UCLA\u2014initiated a process of integrating these institutional nodes into even larger scale networks. It was initially conceived (or at least justified) as a mechanism for sharing expensive computer resources among campuses and research centers; maps of early Arpanet growth show rapid proliferation of campus to campus links. Over time, computers got cheaper, campus computer centers (powerful political entities in the 1960s and 1970s) fragmented into campus LANs such as MIT\u2019s Athena network, and the Arpanet evolved into the Internet. Long before the dot com boom of the late 1990s, the dot edu domain was linking campus offices, laboratories, and dorm rooms globally. Furthermore, the policy on many campuses was to pay interconnection costs centrally rather than to charge individual users, so the Internet seemed like a resource that could be used freely. At the macro scale, during the 1980s and 1990s, wired interconnections encouraged division of labor among campuses, increasingly ambitious and long distance campus to campus collaborations, and formation of geographically distributed professional communities. Much as designers of the Arpanet had focused on long distance sharing of computational resources, college, university, and medical center administrators became increasingly interested in the possibility of sharing specialized human resources through classrooms and lecture halls equipped for videoconferencing, telemedicine suites, and Web sites. At the micro scale, though, wired networks tied teachers and students to fixed points of presence\u2014often to the detriment of face to face community; they tended to keep faculty members (like Dilbert) in their offices and students in wired dormitory rooms. As local and distributed communities competed for mindshare, local began to lose ground; professors and medical specialists often discovered that they had more valuable and satisfying exchanges with colleagues on the far side of the world than with those just down the hall. Meanwhile, the Internet had expanded far beyond its ancestral heartland in academia\u2014making not only on campus sites, but also homes and offices generally, potential delivery points for remote education and telemedicine services. In their most elementary form, remote service sites simply pumped out information that might otherwise have been delivered through print, lectures, or face to face consultations\u2014maybe personalized according to the stored needs profiles of clients. With higher bandwidth and more sophisticated software, these sites could efficiently provide interactions that approximated face to face; you might take a test online from the comfort of your home, or if you lived in a remote community, you might get a reasonably good medical examination through videoconferencing. And with embedded, networked sensors and intelligence, remote sites might perform highly specialized functions that, traditionally, had only been available at central facilities. Homes, for example, could become sophisticated medical monitoring and data collection nodes. Finally, wireless networks superimposed continuous fields of service presence onto this pattern of major and minor points of presence. In particular, the introduction of campus wireless networks in the early 2000s, combined with portable wireless devices and the growth in electronic distribution of educational material, quickly began to break down the rigid person to place connections that had hitherto characterized campus life; students did not need to be at fixed network drops or computer clusters to download or electronically interact, they did not have to go to the library to pick up texts, they no longer required desks or carrels to write, and they did not need to show up in person for videocast lectures.5 They could form ad hoc discussion and collaboration clusters, wherever and whenever they wanted, without losing access to online resources or contact with their geographically extended communities. The classically minded recalled that the Greek philosophers did not have offices and classrooms elaborately organized into departments and schools; they strolled freely through the groves and stoas of academe\u2014but, as Plato vividly emphasized, they had to rely upon their memories. Now, while a scholar stands in line for a sandwich, she can wirelessly search the TLG for a passage from Plato to clinch an argument with her lunch companion. As wireless education serves the mind, wireless medical care attends to the body\u2014and the effects of the resulting service continuity are, potentially, even more dramatic. When monitoring and emergency summoning devices began to migrate from the hospital to the networked home, continuity of service could be increased, and separation of patients from their families and communities could be decreased. Now further migration, to wearable and implanted, wirelessly connected devices, is taking that process a step further. And more active care, through wirelessly operated implants and medication delivery devices, is an obvious possibility.6 All this is not so different from continuously monitoring the conditions and dynamically responding to the biological needs of deep sea divers or astronauts\u2014 but without the cumbersome suits and the tethers back to the ships. Marketers of goods and services can potentially make use of wireless, context aware devices to monitor customer needs continuously and respond to them appropriately, thus gaining a competitive advan tage.7 If you are in a theater, for example, your cellphone might discreetly vibrate in your pocket instead of ringing loudly and disturbing your neighbors. If you are on foot and it\u2019s raining, you might get prompted with the telephone number of the local taxi service and locations of nearby establishments selling umbrellas. Increasingly, businesses will try to be wirelessly present and responsive wherever, whenever, and however their customers need them\u2014but this will, of course, depend upon the willingness of their customers to give up some privacy in order to gain personalized, contextualized service. The advantages of wireless fields of presence are accompanied by subtle and not so subtle challenges to the regime of separation and control that has long been built into schools, campuses, and medical facilities. Schoolteachers were among the first to notice this, as kids equipped with wireless devices began to order pizzas in class, pass SMS notes, and clandestinely circulate answers to test questions. Retailers began to worry that customers in their stores might scan the barcodes on products and wirelessly search for competitors with better prices. Professors delivering lectures began to wonder if they had the undivided attention of students crouched over their wireless laptops and were surprised in seminars as their interlocutors silently downloaded salient information to interject into the discussion. The immediate authoritarian response, of course, was to try to banish personal wireless devices\u2014but this was doomed to failure. When the dust settled, few would willingly give up the benefits of continuous connection. RESTRUCTURING LIVE/WORK Before the emergence of large scale networks, dwellings and workplaces were often intermingled in fine grained spatial patterns. Shepherds slept with their flocks, peasants lived among their fields, craft specialists both lived and worked in urban professional quarters, and merchants resided above their shops. But as Engels so vividly observed in Manchester, industrial cities changed that. Factory owners provided work space, the urban proleteriat provided labor, and the workers lived outside the factory gates. The separation of noisy, polluted industrial zones from leafy garden suburbs, and their linkage by commuter transportation networks, became one of the great triumphs of enlightened urban planning. In a parallel development, telegraph and telephone networks enabled the spatial separation of management from industrial production and allowed managers and clerical workers to cluster with others of their kind in downtown central business districts. The focusing of transportation networks on these centers, and the concentration of network infrastructure there, drove up land values and encouraged high density development. Steel, concrete, glass, and electrically powered systems provided the means, and the high rise office tower emerged in response to these conditions; it became the characteristic business workplace of the twentieth century. There were numerous variations on the theme of the coarsegrained industrial city, with its separated industrial, commercial, and residential zones linked by commuter transportation networks. You might get suburban office parks with parking lots instead of high density, transit serviced cores, secondary and tertiary centers, clusters of towers at edge city locations, and vast, multicentered urban regions such as that of Los Angeles. But in major cities the principle of spatial separation into discrete zones, combined with that of commuter linkage among zones, obtained with remarkable consistency throughout the twentieth century. As the capabilities of wired telecommunication networks developed and their service areas expanded, though, there was increasing speculation that telecommunication might substitute for travel within this sort of urban structure.8 (If Dilbert was isolated in his cubicle, with his computer and his telephone, it might not much matter where that cubicle actually was.) One version of this idea was the concept of home telecommuting; the cubicle might become a study in a suburban house.9 Another was that of the electronic cottage (Landor\u2019s Cottage with email); if you no longer had to commute to work, you might move your residence out beyond suburbia to a distant recreational or scenic area. Yet another version of the idea focused upon access to rural labor markets; if your business was in an expensive urban area where prospective employees could not afford to live, you might try to recruit a telecommuter workforce from less expensive rural areas. And another, again, was motivated by urban workspace costs; employers realized that they could save on rent by relocating employees to less expensive, suburban satellite locations instead of keeping them all at expensive downtown sites, with the added advantage that employees could save on commute time and costs. But these strategies merely substituted one fixed workplace for another, and forced a tradeoff between them. As a result, they met with mixed success. There have been some interesting examples of live/work televillages in attractive locations, such as Richard Rogers\u2019s design for ParcBIT in the Balearic Islands,10 and Giancarlo De Carlo\u2019s rehabilitation of the Ligurian mountain village of Colletta di Castelbianco,11 and electronically serviced live/work has certainly played a role in the revitalization of urban areas such as Manhattan\u2019s SoHo, San Francisco\u2019s SoMa, and Singapore\u2019s China Square. Telecommuting has also proved to be crucial to rapid disaster recovery in the wake of events such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Southern California, and the September 11 attack on New York, which destroyed workplaces and disrupted commuter travel. For example, several thousand Lehman Brothers employees telecommuted in the weeks following September 11, while replacement work space was being found for them. However, by the early 2000s, it seemed clear that full time telecommuting was not going to take off on a large scale. The reason is simply that the tradeoffs don\u2019t necessarily look attractive unless there are some particularly compelling lifestyle, social, or economic motivations to consider. You might appreciate not having to commute, but you might also miss the companionship of coworkers. You might value the comforts of home, but you might also want opportunities to get out of the house. You might enjoy the view from your mountain hideaway, but you might discover that losing visibility at headquarters was a career disadvantage. You might like the flexible hours and childcare opportunities afforded by working at home, but you might realize that the home no longer served as a refuge from work. You might save on travel costs but incur the additional rent and operating costs of a home office. The workplace could fragment, and the home and the workplace could recombine\u2014reinstating a preindustrial pattern in the postindustrial era\u2014but this was not always and unambiguously to the good. By contrast, wireless networks, portable electronic devices, and online work environments now allow information workers to move freely from location to location as needs, desires, and circumstances demand. By the early 2000s, many workers (and their employers) had discovered that they just needed a cellphone and a laptop to operate effectively at their nominal workplaces, on commuter trains, in airplane seats and airport lounges, in hotel rooms, at the sites of clients and collaborators, at home, and on vacation. Anyplace was now a potential workplace. And this condition would only intensify as the technology of nomadics developed and proliferated. So the emerging, characteristic pattern of twenty first century work is not that of telecommuting, as many futurists had once confidently predicted; it is that of the mobile worker who appropriates multiple, diverse sites as workplaces.12 As architects are rapidly discovering, this breaks down rigid functional distinctions among specialized spaces, and makes provision for varied and sometimes unpredictable functions increasingly critical; a home must serve as an occasional workplace, a hotel room must also be an office, a cafe table must accommodate laptops, and a workplace must adapt to more complex and dynamic patterns of use. Special places, with particularly desirable qualities, become powerful attractors when traditional person to workplace linkages are loosened; if you have your wireless connections, a seat under a tree in spring beats an interior office cubicle. And electronically arranged, ad hoc meeting places\u2014where you can most conveniently form the human clusters you need at a particular moment, while remaining in wireless contact\u2014dominate the fixed locations and inflexible schedules that had once been necessary to enable interaction and coordination. HERTZIAN PUBLIC SPACE Public spaces have traditionally worked best at nodes in transportation networks. The central crossroad is typically the focus of rural village life, and in larger settlements this crossroad often grows into a village green, a piazza, or a town square. Still more extensive cities\u2014 among them Rome, Georgian London, Haussmann\u2019s Paris, and Cerda\u2019s Barcelona\u2014have frequently been organized around multiple public spaces embedded in networks of streets and avenues. These spaces become even more effective when they superimpose nodes of different networks. The village crossroad, for example, may not only play a role in local pedestrian circulation, it may also serve as a stop in a regional bus transportation network and the site of a public telephone box. A piazza may be activated by a well or fountain\u2014that is, a public node in a water supply network. And multiple transportation networks may converge, as at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay, where ferries, trains, buses, taxis, and urban pedestrians come together at a bustling, cafe lined interchange and meeting point. In many contexts, wired telecommunication networks have both taken advantage of the activity generated by this superimposition and added an important component to it. Central intersections and squares were natural sites for post and telegraph offices, and before private telephones were common and toll calls were inexpensive, these often expanded to provide banks of booths for long distance phone service. Similarly, in the early Internet era, before network connections had become commonplace and computers had dropped to insignificant cost relative to income levels (a shift still under way in developing countries and areas), networked computer clusters emerged as new foci of public spaces\u2014much like the traditional village well, but supplying a different type of scarce resource. At MIT, for example, Athena clusters unexpectedly developed into important meeting and socializing points. Public libraries also got connected and introduced computer clusters. Then, as the necessary infrastructure spread throughout urban areas, Internet cafes began to take root. It was not surprising that, when telecommunications infrastructure began to return to war torn Afghanistan in 2002, one of the first points of Internet availability was an Internet cafe in the basement of Kabul\u2019s Intercontinental Hotel. The hard core Internet cafe, particularly in the developing world, was nothing more than a low rent, fluorescently lit space jammed with as many computers as possible. In upscale versions, there was more space, some effort to create a pleasant ambience, and an overlay of the electronic action onto more traditional cafe functions; tables simultaneously accommodated (not always with complete success) food, drink, keyboards, and screens. Those that went for the fashionable crowd exploited the pervasive electronics to intensify the pleasures of seeing and being seen. New York\u2019s Remote Lounge, for example, provided cameras above each table to multicast to other tables\u2014and, of course, to a Web site.13 And as public screens became larger and more vivid, their role in creating outdoor spectacle grew\u2014 a gradual shift from cafe to carnival. Fields of LEDs began to take over and transform the roles of the movie poster, the theater marquee, the billboard, the cornice inscription, and even the entire urban facade. Shameless old Times Square, which had long been in the spectacle business, completed its rake\u2019s progress from a space demurely defined by traditional architectural elements, to one dominated by print and paint, then the glitter of lightbulb and neon, to programmed LED pixels; visitors encountered an retina jangling spatial collage of animated graphics, electronic stock and news tickers, television programming (with closed captions instead of sound), reflexive imagery (New Year\u2019s Eve crowds watching video images of themselves), and tourists getting their fifteen seconds of big screen fame on Broadway. Just as the social role of the village well began to fade with the introduction of domestic piped water supply, though, so did that of the public point of network presence as domestic space got wired and computers got cheaper. If you had a networked computer at home, you didn\u2019t need an Internet cafe, and the point of presence that really mattered to you was the switching node that connected your domestic line (the \"last mile\u201d of the network) to your service provider.14 Public access points hung on longer in specialized contexts\u2014where they provided significant technological advantage (in particular, faster and more reliable connection), as in India, where infrastructure is sparse and often unreliable and private connection remained beyond the reach of many, in China, where Internet cafes also served as connections to a wider world and rallying points for the intelligentsia, and in Korea,15 where PC baangs allowed kids to escape from crowded domestic space and strict parental supervision and had a particular cultural resonance in the land of consumer electronic gadgets\u2014but by the early 2000s it was clear that they would eventually shrink to niche roles at best. They would go the way of other hopeful space mutations, such as the telegraph station and the drive in movie theater, which had emerged in response to particular technological conditions and were left behind by further technological change. Meanwhile, continuous fields of network presence had begun to blanket public spaces. This began with cellular technology, which brought phones out of seclusion like bees from a hive and rapidly transformed public behavior and space use\u2014most obviously by inserting the essentially private activity of phone conversation into space governed by the conventions of public conduct. This created frictions, which had to be resolved by the development of new rules of etiquette. Miss Manners had her work cut out for her: continuous phone accessibility was part of the point, but this produced rings at inappropriate times and places. You might call from a public place to avoid being overheard at home or in the office, but you might end up annoying strangers with your chatter; you might be so engrossed in your private conversation that you lost track of your immediate surroundings and walked into someone; your phone might inconveniently ring while you were in company, forcing you to find a quick and graceful way to excuse yourself; and, if you couldn\u2019t help overhearing an embarrassing private conversation, you had to avert your eyes and compose your face. A more profound outcome was the new capacity of mobile urbanites, at unknown locations, to arrange ad hoc meeting places.16 In the past, meetings had depended upon explicit prearrangement (leaving you at a loss if, for some reason, your party didn\u2019t show up as expected), upon random encounter, and upon standard meeting places and regular schedules that increased the probability of random encounter. Italian piazzas, for example, had traditionally depended for their social efficacy upon their central locations and ingrained conventions of showing up there at established times; now, Italians simply call one another and arrange meetings on the fly. Piazzas still look the same and still work superbly as public space, but their patterns of use have become far more flexible. In dangerous urban contexts, such as the conflict ridden cities of the Middle East, continuous cellphone communication has become crucial for tracking and intelligence. Parents use cellphones to keep in contact with their mobile children, to check up on them when something happens, and to get up to date reports on current conditions. In contested contexts, as when cities experience street demonstrations, cellphones play an equally crucial coordination role; swarms of mobile, wirelessly connected and coordinated demonstrators contend with similarly equipped and coordinated squads of police. And, in less tense situations, the same sorts of strategies drive the game of cellphone coordinated celebrity spotting. With the emergence of 802.11 wireless networks in the early 2000s, a new field of functional possibility superimposed itself on public space. This hub and card technology provided convenient connectivity for wireless laptops, and enthusiasts set about creating public wireless hotspots. These first emerged in semipublic spaces\u2014such as cafes, bars, lobbies, waiting rooms, and airport lounges\u2014which suddenly became much more useful as ad hoc workplaces and online interaction points; instead of reading a newspaper, you could download your email or surf the Web. (If you wanted privacy, you learned to take the seat against the wall, and keep the back of your screen to the public.) Then hotspots migrated outdoors. Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park was one of the first outdoor public places to provide for 802.11 surfing under the trees and email from a park bench. A latter day Manet might paint laptop users on the grass. In general, as these transformations of public space illustrate, there is a strong relationship between prevailing network structure and the distribution of activities over public and private places. Where essential urban networks have relatively few access points, as with public transportation and water supply networks, the access points are often in public places, attract activity to those places, and thus strengthen their roles as meeting and interaction points. When networks become more ramified\u2014as with domestic water supply and sewer, automobile transportation, electrical, and communication net works\u2014they tend to decentralize functions and move them into private spaces\u2014the public bathhouse gives way to the private bathroom, the public theater to the private home entertainment center. And where networks go wireless, they mobilize activities that had been tied to fixed locations and open up ways of reactivating urban public space; the home entertainment center reemerges as the Walkman, the home telephone as the cellphone, and the home computer as the laptop. VIRTUAL CAMPFIRES In traditional nomadic societies, regularly rekindled campfires provided mobile focal points for social life. With urbanization, social life became more commonly focused by fixed attractions\u2014village wells, domestic hearths, and computer network drops. In the mobile wireless era, a third alternative has emerged; we can use our portable communication devices to construct meeting points and gathering places on the fly\u2014places that may only be known within particular, electronically linked groups, and which may only play such roles for fleeting moments. 10 AGAINST PROGRAM As continuous fields of presence are overlaid on architectural and urban space, the ancient distinction between settlers and nomads\u2014 long the bedrock of our thinking about cities\u2014is eroding in subtle but important ways. In the emerging wireless era, our buildings and urban environments need fewer specialized spaces built around sites of accumulation and resource availability and more versatile, hospitable, accommodating spaces that simply attract occupation and can serve diverse purposes as required. A cafe table can serve as a library reading room. A quiet place under a tree can become a design studio. A subway car can become a place for watching movies. ELECTRONOMADIC SPATIAL PRACTICES The relationships of mobile bodies to sedentary structures have loosened and destabilized; inhabitation is less about doing what some designer or manager explicitly intended in a space and more about imaginative, ad hoc appropriation for unanticipated purposes. We are becoming less like Saint Jerome, immobilized in his study among his accumulated possessions, less like Dilbert stuck at his computer in his cubicle, and more like cyborg foragers navigating through electronically mediated resource fields. We are relying less upon things (or people) being at fixed locations, or available on regular schedules, and more upon electronic tracking and navigation to locate what we want and take us to it. Our mental maps of buildings and cities are becoming less static records of fixed features and more dynamic representations of current conditions. This condition, understood in the most optimistic way, offers liberation from the rigidities and interdictions of the predefined program and the zone\u2014a release from ways of using spaces produced and enforced by dominant social orders.1 It opens up the possibility of new, as yet unimagined spatial practices, and the opportunity (in the words of Michel de Certeau) \"to rediscover, within an electroni cized and computerized megalopolis, the \u2018art\u2019 of the hunters and rural folk of earlier days.\u201d2 Or, if you don\u2019t like the pseudo primitivism of this formulation, you might imagine rediscovering Baudelaire\u2019s flanerie,3 situationist \"drift,\u201d4 or whatever it was that Deleuze and Guattari were recommending in A Thousand Plateaus.5 Conversely, for those who would exert state or corporate power, it offers anonymity and the possibility of avoiding resistance. Today, such power may flow as easily from a fluidly and ambiguously located constellation of cellphones as it traditionally has from a throne room in a palace, a boardroom in a corporate headquarters, or a courtroom in a national capital. As resistance movements have quickly realized, sites for effective confrontation of power are becoming harder to iden tify.6 How do you determine a time and locate a place for resistance? Where do you demonstrate? What do you occupy? The evolution of taxi fleets has dramatized these transformations in the use and control of space. In the past, where urban densities were too low for drivers to rely upon customers hailing them in the street, centralized wireless dispatchers fielded telephone calls and assigned jobs. Now cabbies carry cellphones as well, and rely upon their mobile, distributed, peer to peer networks for intelligence about traffic conditions and tips about concentrations of potential customers. In more advanced systems, customers make location coded cellphone calls, cabs have GPS navigation systems, and software assigns jobs based upon proximity. There is a shift from centralized coordination and control to electronically mediated swarming. While their elders were trying to figure all this out, kids\u2014 employing the short text messaging capabilities of cellphones\u2014imagi natively pioneered the new spatial tactics of ad hoc occupation and electronic appropriation. They quickly learned to fan out through city streets in fluid packs, electronically negotiating and specifying sites for assignations, raves, and street demonstrations. Those who wanted to repress these practices soon came up with the countermeasure (at least for the moment)\u2014have the cops confiscate the phones. And the kids, in response, are discovering how to immobilize opponents by unleashing worms and viruses that clog channels of communication. Control of space\u2014particularly in real time\u2014now requires control of the airwaves. In many ways, the dynamic ebbs and flows of the basketball court and the soccer field provide compelling models for these new spatial practices. The players are mobile, autonomous actors, but they are in constant visual and auditory communication with one another, and they adjust their actions in response to evolving situations. Over larger chunks of terrain, the wirelessly communicating units of a military operation act in similarly coordinated fashion. Now, spatially dispersed yet coordinated, fluid collections of wirelessly interconnecting individuals\u2014perhaps assembled, from the beginning, in cyberspace rather than at any physical location\u2014are becoming a crucial fact of urban life. They constitute a new category of human assemblage\u2014 one to add to our traditional conceptions of the gathering, the throng, the crowd, the masses, the mob, the cadre, the cell, the ensemble, the battalion, and the team.7 The connected masses also create problems of differential mobility. Traditional nomads understood these problems well and often dealt with them brutally; they left behind the aged, infirm, and otherwise immobilized. In the context of electronomadics, it is often a matter of relative reliance on bits and atoms, and the consequences tend to be economic. Scholars who can rely upon online resources are highly mobile and can work effectively on the road, but their colleagues who need access to undigitized print material or precious original manuscripts are still tied to traditional scholarly sites and practices. Telephone call centers can readily relocate and may want the flexibility to do so when it becomes economically advantageous, so they may be reluctant to invest in surrounding communities. Financial firms that had their premises destroyed in the World Trade Center attacks could instantly activate backup sites and send their employees into telecommuter mode, but restaurants and other small establishments that serviced those firms in Lower Manhattan were stuck at their sites, lost clientele, and suffered disproportionately badly. The new mobility divide may turn out to be more important than the digital divide. THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ARCHITECTURAL PROGRAM For architects, continuous fields of presence and the destabilization of person to place relationships demand some radical rethinking of the fundamentals. The standard procedure of twentieth century modernism was to start by distinguishing and separating functions\u2014the better to optimize spaces for particular functions and to announce those functions visually. (Communication engineers might think of it as space division multiplexing of activities.) At an urban scale, housing areas were to be distinguished from industrial and commercial zones. At building scale, there were to be specialized spaces, with associated equipment, for the activities that were to be accommodated. And the physical fabric of a building was to be articulated function ally\u2014for example, by separating the supporting and enclosing functions of a wall by substituting columns for support and a nonbearing curtain wall for enclosure. But this strategy makes little sense when wireless electronic devices can support many different activities at a single location or the same activity at many different locations, and when running different software can radically alter the functions provided by a device without changing its form at all. Time division multiplexing of activities is starting to look smarter than space division. The key instrument of the traditional spatial organization strategy was the written architectural program \u2014a detailed list of required spaces, specifying floor areas, technical requirements, and adjacency needs.8 Built space made the provisions of the program concrete, and construction bureaucrats compared plans to checklists just to make sure. But the architecture of the twenty first century can (if we choose to take the opportunity) be far less about responding to such rigid programs and much more about creating flexible, diverse, humane habitats for electronically supported nomadic occupation. It can be an architecture not of stable routines and spatial patterns, but, as Michael Batty has suggested, of continually reconfiguring clusters of spatial events characterized by their duration, intensity, volatility, and location.9 This architecture will pursue the benefits of loose binding. Consider these in the context of office space, for example. When office workers have cubicles filled with files and bookshelves, it is relatively difficult and expensive to move them around; churn takes time and costs money, so managers have traditionally tried to minimize it\u2014 with the result that organizations are slow to adapt to change, and workers are often left in locations that no longer serve them well. But if the personal information environments of office workers automatically and instantaneously follow them around, they can sit down and work anywhere. The cost of regrouping to meet new needs drops almost to zero. You can also look at this from a long term space management perspective. When organizations move into new buildings, they usually have carefully worked out space plans. Then, over time, they make incremental changes in response to emerging demands, with the result that the space becomes fragmented and inefficient, much as the disk space does on your computer. Defragmentation is difficult and expensive when move costs are high, but it is easy when move costs become negligible. It is just like running Norton Utilities to clean up your disk. Furthermore, physical enclosure for information security purposes now matters less, while electronic security matters more. It was once essential to ring cities with defensive walls, but that is irrelevant now. And it was once crucial to lock office doors, so that the papers and files inside could be protected against dispersal or destruction, and so that their confidentiality could be preserved. (In fact that was one of the main reasons for the very existence of private offices.) Espionage was a matter of clandestinely breaking in and stealing papers or making illicit copies. If your files are online, though, and accessible to you anywhere you log in, you do not have to work in a physically secure space. You do want to be sure that those files are regularly backed up and electronically protected against unauthorized access, and you probably want to sit so that your laptop screen is protected from prying eyes.10 In other words, information security has been deterritorialized and shifted to a domain of abstract symbol manipulation. Selectively (though certainly not universally), space to space relationships are loosening. For convenience and security, old fashioned library reading rooms had to be adjacent to book stacks, but that constraint disappears when stacks become servers and carrels become wireless reception points. To make most efficient use of an expensive resource, office staff once needed convenient access to a central copying machine, but that imperative evaporates when making a copy becomes a matter of sending a file through a network rather than carrying an original to a machine, and when inexpensive, networked laser printers are widely distributed. As connectivity matters more, in many contexts, adjacency matters less, and architectural form is less tightly determined by the need to satisfy adjacency requirements. Even established ideas of flexibility and adaptability require reconsideration. In the past, architects provided these qualities by introducing modular, demountable partitions and furniture, movable components, plug in devices, and the like. Now the focus is shifting to self configuring electronic environments\u2014enabled by electronic devices that can immediately begin to communicate wirelessly with one another when they are brought into proximity and that can work together to support whatever activities are taking place.11 Laptops are beginning to talk wirelessly to video projectors, projectors and cameras to printers, telephones to speaker systems, video cameras to monitors, PDAs to other PDAs, automobiles to gas pumps, and so on. In some ways, then, we are returning to strategies and practices of preliterate, precapitalist times. Ancient Greek philosophers, for example, did not have offices and classrooms; they strolled with their students through the groves of academe. Then the Hellenistic Library of Alexandria became a site of immobile accumulation, the fixed focus of a unique community, and a place where scholars had to be. Today, the Web is our Library of Alexandria, and mobile wireless connection allows scholars to stroll once more\u2014but without losing access to the resources they need. This does sit uneasily, of course, with some large, petrified chunks of the Western philosophical tradition. If you are a Heideggerian, you will probably fret about \"wandering\u201d versus \u201cdwelling.\u201d And, if you take the Hegelian position that surrounding oneself with tangible property is a way of imprinting your presence on the world (Jerome\u2019s books did not just serve his needs, they defined him), then you will be dispirited by digital dematerialization and networked server access. Perhaps, though, this just means that giants of thought are still creatures of their time\u2014and maybe, in these cases, too prone to generalize from the stability and clutter of the bourgeois drawing room.12 ELECTRONIC NON PLAN At a larger scale, the instrument for distinguishing and separating functions has long been land use zoning. This sometimes has a com monsense and unobjectionable function, as for example in mandating the separation of residential areas from noxious industry. But it has frequently been used to enforce far less benign forms of segregation. And there are far fewer good reasons to separate activities\u2014such as working, being entertained, and pursuing your social life\u2014when they are all supported by the same wireless, portable devices, and when, unobtrusively handled in this way, they do not interfere with the activities of others. There is, then, a new kind of opportunity to recoup the \u201cright to the city,\u201d which Henri Lefebvre powerfully characterized in terms of heterogeneity rather than monoculture, encounter rather than separation, and simultaneity instead of sequence, and which he saw as threatened by \u201cdiscriminatory and segregative organization.\u201d13 Land use planners might move toward Lefebvre\u2019s \u201cdiversification of space,\u201d in which \u201cthe (relative) importance attached to functional distinctions would disappear.\u201d The sixties Anglo American counterpart to Lefebvre\u2019s insistence on the right to the city was a provocative call for \u201cnon plan,\u201d set forth in a notorious New Society article by Reyner Banham, Paul Barker, Peter Hall, and Cedric Price.14 In it, the authors bluntly claimed that \u201cthe most rigorously planned cities\u2014like Haussmann\u2019s and Napoleon Ill\u2019s Paris\u2014have nearly always been the least democratic,\u201d and asked \u201cWhat would happen if there were no plan? What would people prefer to do, if their choice were untrammeled?\u201d This comported with contemporary architectural interest in combining serviced megastructures These proposals vividly expressed the possibility of flexibility and freedom of choice, but they mostly didn\u2019t deliver. Large scale physical reconfiguration of architectural space in response to changing needs has remained a slow, cumbersome, and expensive process. Furthermore, occupiable space is still a scarce resource, and physical reconfigurability does little to diminish problems of space allocation and coordination. But the proponents of non plan had glimpsed another possibility in what was then known as the \"cybernetic revolution.\u201d They wrote: \"The essence of the new situation is that we can master vastly greater amounts of information than was hitherto thought possible\u2014information essentially about the effect of certain defined actions upon the operation of a system.\u201d Planning had depended upon \"simple, rule of thumb value judgments\u201d that were held to have \"perpetual validity, like tablets of the law.\u201d Today, they concluded: \"Physical planning, like anything else, should consist at most of setting up frameworks for decision, within which as much objective information as possible can be fitted.\u201d In other words, information infrastructure that provides a framework for dynamic decision making is more powerful than physical megastructure. If you want adaptability, responsive software beats reconfigurable hardware. Several decades later, of course, the non plan group\u2019s faith in \"objective information\u201d and \"scientific management\u201d seems uncritically naive. (The remaining members would, no doubt, be the first to say so.) But mobile connectivity, combined with reduced reliance upon immobile resources, has heightened the need, which they so presciently identified, to replace predetermined space programs and rigid plans with swiftly and sensitively responsive, electronically implemented space management strategies. By the early 2000s, we could see the beginnings of this in the combination of electronic road pricing and electronic navigation systems for managing road real estate, the combination of electronic tracking of parking space occupancy and automatic direction to vacant spaces, and flexible assignment of office cubicles to mobile, laptop equipped workers. It is no longer the architectural programmer who controls space use, and thereby expresses power; it is now the software programmer. EXTREME ELECTRONOMADICS What if we could go all the way with shaking ourselves loose, shuck the last few atoms from our souls, and simply live on server farms somewhere? The gonzo endpoint of these trajectories of dematerialization and hypermobilization is the suggestion that mental life is just an affair of bits in the brain; you might strip them from this squishy substrate (much as one rips a CD) and download yourself onto disk. You are, on this view, just software\u2014and as device independent as a Java applet. You don\u2019t have to run on a high maintenance meat machine. You no longer have to be, as Yeats so famously lamented, \"fastened to a dying animal.\u201d Like saints and shamans in ecstasis, you loosen, to the ultimate, the binding of your persona to materiality and place. Hans Moravec has speculatively described the necessary operation: Layer after layer, the brain is simulated, then excavated. Eventually your skull is empty, and the surgeon\u2019s hand rests deep in your brainstem. Though you have not lost consciousness, or even your train of thought, your mind has been removed from the brain and transferred to a machine.19 I\u2019m not too sure about the brain science of all this; no doubt the inscription of information into organic neural networks is rather more complex that that of magnetic bits onto thinly spread iron oxide.20 And I would be surprised (to say the least) if the continuity of personal identity turned out to be such a straightforward matter, or if the mind/body distinction reduced so neatly to software/hardware.21 (Belief in this possibility is, of course, the extreme form of the digi talist dogma that \"content\u201d can always be cleanly separated from its current material embodiment.) But let us assume we can successfully read, decode, and copy all our brain files\u2014the equivalents of WORD files of memorized text, JPG files of visual memory, MP3 files of unforgettable tunes, EXE files that specify how to get things done, and so on. Let us imagine a \"postbiological future\u201d in which \"we will think of ourselves as software, not hardware.\u201d22 What then? It would put land use and transportation planners out of work; real estate requirements would now be measured in megabytes rather than square feet, mobility in terms of bits per second rather than miles per hour, and accessibility in terms of wireless network coverage. But the result is not disembodiment, in the sense of complete erasure of materiality. Nor is it reincarnation in humanoid avatar form. It is a more complex, spatially distributed, fluid, hybrid form of embodiment enacted with new hardware\u2014one in which silicon, copper, and magnetic subsystems play a vastly increased role, while carbon based subsystems play a diminished and no longer so privileged one.23 Mortality reappears as a server crash. (There are some work arounds, perhaps; you could implement reincarnation as restoration from backup, and transmigration of the soul as a hardware replacement strategy.)24 So, why bother with the messy and problematic brain operation? By other means, anyway, we are already asymptotically approaching that networked cyborg state. Why insist on taking the carbon completely to zero?25 We are at the endgame of a process that began when our distant ancestors started to clothe themselves with second skins stripped from other creatures, to extend and harden their hands with simple tools and weapons, and to record information by scratching marks on surfaces. It picked up speed when our more recent forebears began to wire up telegraph, telephone, and packet switching networks, to place calls, to log in, and to download dematerialized information to wireless portable devices. It is repeated whenever a child learns to do these things; for the cyborg, ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. It is not that we have become posthuman in the wireless network era; since Neanderthal early adopters first picked up sticks and stones, we have never been human.26 11 CYBORG AGONISTES Palma Nova, near Venice, with its famous star shaped fortifications, is a city of two tales.1 You can read complementary narratives from the plan. One tale is of enclosure. The walls, as in other ancient, medieval, and Renaissance cities, protected the concentrations of assets and sedentarized populations within from nomadic bandits and mobile armies without. In addition, as Lewis Mumford cogently argued in The Culture of Cities, the power of massed numbers in itself gave the city a superiority over thinly populated, widely scattered villages, and served as an incentive to further growth.2 Density and defended walls provided safety, economic vitality, and long term resilience. In extreme conditions, when the city was under siege, the gates were closed, the battlements were manned, and the city became self contained for the duration. If you wanted to attack it, you called upon some technology to breach the defensive perimeter, like Joshua\u2019s trumpet, Achilles\u2019 wooden horse, Francesco di Giorgio\u2019s tunnel beneath the walls of Castel Nuovo, a battering ram, or a siege engine. The second tale is of connection. The central piazza, surrounded by public buildings, is both the focus of the internal street network and the local hub of a road network that extends through the gates and out into the countryside, linking the city to others. The piazza is\u2014like the server of a local ISP\u2014a node at which nearby and larger communities are connected. When the gates are open, the city functions as a crossroads rather than a sealed enclosure, a place of interaction rather than one of exclusion. Urban history is, from one perspective, a struggle of these narratives for dominance. Eventually, the network won. Mumford associated this victory with the rise of capitalism\u2014a new constellation of economic forces that \"favored expansion and dispersal in every direction, from overseas colonization to the building up of new industries, whose technological improvements simply canceled out all medieval restrictions.\u201d For emerging modern cities, \"the demolition of their urban walls was both practical and symbolic.\u201d3 Superficially, modern Manhattan resembles a scaled up version of Palma Nova; it has a regularized street grid, is surrounded by water, and can be accessed by a limited number of bridges and tunnels. But the networks are denser and more numerous, they extend the city\u2019s connections much further out into the world, and they provide many more functions. Road, rail, water, and air transportation links connect to local, regional, and global destinations. Water supply and sewer networks extend the island\u2019s hydrological footprint over a huge area and establish vital connections to distant collection, storage, and treatment sites. Mechanical air supply networks make the interiors of large buildings, and the city\u2019s many underground spaces, inhabitable. Pipes for hydrocarbons and wires for electricity densely blanket the built fabric with delivery nodes and extend the supply network to tank farms and power stations far out in the hinterland.4 There is a wired telecommunications network that began with the telegraph, evolved into an analog telephone network, and is now transforming into a multifunctional digital system. And there are multiple forms of wireless networking\u2014particularly broadcast radio and television, microwave, cellphone, pager, and 802.11. Horizontal network links make use of terrestrial, subsurface, and aerial real estate, while vertical links run through the service cores and chases of buildings. Today, in the era of the network triumphant, the technologies of attack and defense have correspondingly transformed. You can still, of course, just obliterate a city with explosives and bulldozers, but there are now subtler means. You can bring down the networks it depends upon and just let it die. (This is not an entirely new strategy: in 537 C.e., the Goths cut the aqueducts serving Rome and forced its defenders to flee.) Even more effectively, you can hijack those networks and turn them back against their creators\u2014delivering destruction by appropriating the very transfer and distribution capabilities that motivated their construction. Furthermore, since digital networks increasingly control other networks, there is an entirely new type of threat to contend with. Not only may there be direct physical attacks against the \"real property\u201d components of critical urban networks, there may also be cyberattacks against the computers and networks that control those infrastructures. As a U.S. Congress committee reported in May 2002, a computer hack may cause \"the same damage as a strategically placed bomb.\u201d5 The same report added, \"A cyberattack can originate from any part of the globe and from any nation, group or individual. The low cost of equipment, the readily available technology and cybertools, and the otherwise modest resources needed to mount a cyberattack makes it impossible for governments, much less businesses, to identify or track all potential cyberadversaries.\u201d6 CRASHING NETWORKS The simplest way to crash a network is to block or sever a crucial link. Networks fail\u2014sometimes catastrophically\u2014when backhoes cut telephone or power cables, blood clots block arteries, or accidents jam the 405 Freeway. They are particularly vulnerable to this form of failure at points where there is no alternative route (or, at least, no efficient one) for traffic to take. That is why links such as the Khyber Pass, or San Francisco\u2019s Bay Bridge, are of such strategic importance; break them, and you disconnect large chunks of network, on either side, from each other. It is even more effective, in general, to shut down a node\u2014particularly one at which many links converge. If an earthquake destroys a freeway interchange, for example, travel in several directions is blocked at that point. And if you close a major airline hub, such as Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport, you produce a major air travel disruption. Furthermore, nodes often concentrate more crucial functionality than links. Sever a vein, and you may survive, but stop your heart and you\u2019re a goner. Yank a cable at the periphery of a LAN and most of the network continues to function, but crash the central server and the whole network goes down. If part of a network fails to perform its function, the trouble may propagate to other links and nodes\u2014particularly where the network is tightly coupled. A sewer blockage can produce a backup to your sink or toilet, and a fender bender can quickly propagate traffic jams far back through a freeway network. This becomes particularly troublesome when there are no escape mechanisms, such as pressure valves and off ramps; that\u2019s why New Yorkers dread getting stuck in the Holland Tunnel. Even worse, propagation of overload conditions can cause progressive failure of network infrastructure. In an electric power network, for example, burnout of a transformer can propagate excess loads to other parts of the network, which fail in turn, and so on. It is much the same with nuclear chain reactions, and with progressive structural failures, like that of the World Trade Towers, where floors collapsed onto lower floors, which then became overloaded and collapsed themselves, and so on with gathering force. To be protected against progressive failure, networks need devices such as fuses or circuit breakers, which sacrifice themselves to prevent further propagation of damage. In large, high speed networks, such as modern power grids and the Internet, patterns of overload propagation and progressive failure are potentially very complex, hard to predict, and frustratingly difficult to control. Once they get started, even in a small way, there is an ever present danger that they will grow explosively to produce large scale, long term damage. In 1998, for example, the power grid of Auckland, New Zealand, experienced a cascading failure that badly damaged all four of the central business district\u2019s main power arteries. The New Zealand Stock Exchange shut down until it could switch to backup power, the central business district was darkened for many weeks, air conditioners and refrigerators went out (in the Southern Hemisphere summer months), and the pubs had to serve warm beer\u2014 something the locals took particularly amiss. In addition to hardware failure, software failure can also propagate alarmingly. In January 1990, a minor mechanical malfunction in an AT&amp;T telephone switching center in Lower Manhattan caused the switch to shut down and automatically reset its control software. When the switch came up again, it notified other switches around the country that they could begin routing calls to it. Unfortunately, these notifications triggered a control software bug, which shut down the switches that received it. When these switches restarted, they further propagated the problem, and so on. Before the problem could be diagnosed and corrected, it had affected all 114 switching centers in the AT&amp;T system, severely disabled the system for nine hours, prevented 70 million of the 138 million long distance and 800 number calls placed on the system that day from getting through, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in business losses.7 And it can get even worse; since different types of networks are often functionally interdependent, failure of one type can produce failure of another. Telecommunication and electrical supply networks are particularly closely intertwined; telecommunication devices require electric power, and increasingly, power grids are managed by means of sophisticated telecommunication systems. Similarly, if the power grid goes out, the traffic lights cease to function, and the traffic network rapidly snarls up. And where pumps power water and air supply networks, power failure quickly renders many buildings uninhabitable. Even where there is no direct functional interdependency, the physical collocation of network links can propagate failures; for example, the tunnels into Manhattan provide both transportation and telecommunication conduits, so destruction would simultaneously affect both types of networks.8 And the destruction of the World Trade Center towers took out both a major subway transportation node in the basement and a concentration of wireless telecommunication nodes on the roof. One often told, dramatic tale of cross network cascading is that of a Worcester, Massachusetts, kid who hacked a telephone switch, wiping out custom settings and disabling telephone service in the area.9 The automated control tower of the local airport used the telephone network to activate runway landing lights. Thus, when an approaching plane signaled the tower to switch on the lights, the lights failed to operate, and the airport had to be closed. STRUCTURE AND VULNERABILITY Sometimes, large networks fail\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014due to general destruction of their infrastructure. When an ice storm hit Quebec in January 1998, for example, it brought down trees, poles, pylons, and tens of thousands of miles of power lines spread over a huge area. As a result, large parts of Montreal were left without power for most of a freezing month, and the emergency repair effort was enormous. But under some circumstances, highly localized failure or destruction can also produce major outages. At the very dawn of the computer network era, pioneering researchers began to realize that the capacity of a network to continue functioning after damage depended a great deal upon its structure. Paul Baran introduced his seminal paper on distributed communications networks with a diagram showing three types of networks\u2014 centralized, decentralized, and distributed.10 The centralized networks consisted of links radiating from a central node, exactly as with the radial roads of Palma Nova and other centrally planned cities. It was, as Baran noted, \"obviously vulnerable as destruction of a single central node destroys communication between the end stations.\u201d High rise towers suffer from a similar vulnerability when, as in the World Trade Center towers, their vertical access routes are concentrated in central service cores. Building codes do require multiple, separated means of escape, and this may suffice in the case of relatively small fires, but it does not suffice when catastrophic events destroy cores entirely. The decentralized network was a \"set of stars connected in the form of a larger star,\u201d much like the patterns of major streets radiating from public places in the Wren plan for London, the Haussmann plan for Paris, and the L\u2019Enfant plan for Washington. The centers of stars were still points of vulnerability, but the destruction of one such subcenter would not be a complete disaster; this would disconnect nodes directly linked to it, but the rest of the network could continue to function. Thus decentralization provided a way of scaling up and of isolating the effects of damage. The distributed network was a nonhierarchical mesh, as in the street grids of Manhattan and Chicago, though not necessarily as regular. Its redundancy provided robustness; if nodes or links were destroyed, traffic could simply route around the damage. But there was an efficiency penalty; to get from one node to another, you typically had to pass through many intermediate nodes, which were poten tial points of inefficient transfer and congestion. If you travel through a street grid, you always have many options, and you are unlikely to get stuck if there\u2019s a blockage somewhere, but you will encounter many stop signs and traffic lights. Similarly, if high rise towers were interconnected by sky bridges, they would enhance safety through the increased redundancy and wider spatial distribution of their escape networks, but they would be harder to control by means of security checkpoints at entry level elevator lobbies. In practice then, large transportation, communication, and other networks are often combinations of stars and meshes\u2014seeking a balanced combination of the advantages of both. So Palma Nova has not only its radial arteries, but also several rings of streets concentrically around the central piazza, and smaller piazzas (forming mini hubs) at the centers of its wedge shaped segments. The radial streets of Paris and Washington are superimposed upon meshes and grids of more minor streets, and the radial transportation links of many modern cities are supplemented by ring roads and ring lines. Air transportation networks are increasingly organized around major hubs but continue to include links that do not pass through the hubs. And the vast structure of the Internet has turned out to be highly hierarchical, with a dominant pattern of major hubs, but also with significant amounts of meshing in many regions.11 ACCIDENT AND ATTACK The large, decentralized networks that increasingly dominate our globalized world have turned out to be remarkably resistant to random accidents and failures. Nodes and links may go down here and there, but unless they unfortunately happen to be vital hubs or critical arteries, the effects are usually fairly brief and localized. But deliberate attack is another matter. Intelligent attackers can pick out the most attractive targets\u2014going simultaneously for several major hubs, for example, rather than wasting their ammunition on peripheral nodes. Even a structure as large and heavily meshed as the Internet is probably very vulnerable to coordinated pinpoint attacks; there are good reasons to conceal, harden, and defend major switching nodes. The attack on New York\u2019s World Trade Center towers vividly drove home these lessons about network structure. In the immediate aftermath, the surface street network, which is highly redundant, continued to function effectively. The New York subway system is much less redundant, so destruction of a major node beneath the towers did produce significant, long term transportation outages. But the attraction of the target to the terrorists was not only the concentration of human life and the powerful symbolism of the towers, but also the role of Lower Manhattan as a key node in the global financial network\u2014supported by an astonishing concentration of telecommunications infrastructure. In September 2001, there was more fiberoptic cable under the streets of Manhattan than in all of Africa, the two main telephone switches in the Financial District had more lines than many European nations, and there were more than 1,500 antenna structures on top of the World Trade Center north tower. The destruction of telecommunications infrastructure was extensive. Verizon served more than three million local phone lines from its 140 West Street central office, which was badly damaged by debris, smoke, and water. AT&amp;T had a central office in the basement of the World Trade Center; this survived the building collapse but lost electric supply and eventually went down when backup battery power gave out at 4 p.m. on September 11. It had served 20,000 T1 lines and 1,200 T3 lines to customers throughout Lower Manhattan and as far away as Long Island, so outages occurred not only locally but also in a random pattern throughout the region. At least fifteen cellular telephone base stations were lost, while many others had their landline connections knocked out by the damage to Verizon\u2019s facility. And of course the antennas on top of the north tower were all gone. This loss of infrastructure combined with a surge in demand for telephone service, with the result that the telephone network became severely overloaded. On September 11, telephone traffic in the New York area was at about double the normal levels. Cellphone networks were jammed; during the morning, fewer than five percent of calls were connected. Nationally and internationally, AT&amp;T connected 431 million calls\u2014about twenty percent more than normal. To keep outgoing lines from New York and Washington open, AT&amp;T blocked incoming calls. It required an enormous telecommunications recovery effort to get the New York Stock Exchange back in operation six days later. The Internet continued to operate much as its designers had hoped.12 There were some localized outages due to infrastructure damage and power failures, there was a surge in email traffic, and major news Web sites quickly became overloaded, but all this had little effect on the global Internet. However, the New York metropolitan area was, at that point, the Internet\u2019s largest single international bandwidth hub, and several of its major switching centers (carrier hotels) were all within close proximity on the west side of Lower Manhattan. It became apparent that a coordinated attack on the carrier hotels might have disconnected New York from the rest of the world, or the U.S. from Europe\u2014though connections from the U.S. West Coast to Asia would still have continued to operate. FEAR OF FOREIGN BODIES But it can be better strategy to exploit, rather than destroy, the networks of your enemies. When you can obtain access to a large scale network that they have obligingly constructed, you don\u2019t\u2014like Napoleon marching to Moscow\u2014have to expend a lot of effort moving your forces over large distances to reach your enemy. You don\u2019t even have to possess forces comparable to theirs. You can deliver violence and destruction, with modest means but pinpoint accuracy, by infiltrating or hijacking their networks. The AIDS epidemic provided a brutal preview of this strategy. The HIV virus, as we quickly discovered, efficiently propagates itself through the network established by human sexual contact and by blood transfer\u2014a network that has, in recent decades, been vastly extended through high speed travel and population mobility. It has infiltrated itself into this human construction and has hijacked it for its own purposes. And in doing so, it has created a distributed state of siege\u2014not the geographically focused sort, such as Palma Nova\u2019s walls were designed to withstand, but one manifested at a million condoms. Unlike the plagues of old, which required population density to flourish and could often be kept at bay by isolating and quarantining populations, AIDS depends upon the existence of connected paths\u2014maybe extending over vast distances\u2014within a global network. The SARS epidemic of 2003 was a later variant on this theme. The virus was airborne, so face masks rather than condoms became the first line of defense. International gathering places\u2014hotels, restaurants, air terminals, and airliner cabins\u2014provided entry points into the long distance air transportation network, which quickly propagated cases from the point of origin in China to Hong Kong and Singapore, then throughout the world. The more you relied on this network, the more exposed you were. Computer viruses are chunks of mobile code in digital form, rather than genetic code in bioformat, but they turn out to operate in much the same way. They are too familiar, now, to require detailed explanation, and their potential for destruction has grown with the Internet. Just a week after September 11, for example, the Nimda virus struck 85,000 servers throughout the world, producing far more Internet congestion, outage, and economic damage than the infrastructure losses resulting from the World Trade Center attack.13 Such viruses dramatically illustrate the downsides of decentralizing production and dematerializing functionality; they can be produced by even the moderately computer literate (right down to very modestly skilled script kiddies) at any of the world\u2019s millions of Internet nodes and propagated rapidly from those nodes. They can even be injected wirelessly into the Internet from mobile and transient locations. And, like the HIV virus, they generate a globally distributed state of siege\u2014this time manifested at email filters to exclude suspicious incoming messages, virus protected PCs, and corporate network firewalls. Miniaturization, biotechnology, and nanotechnology provide yet more opportunities to infiltrate networks and turn them destructively back upon themselves. If you can produce small quantities of powerful toxins, virulent bioagents, or even vicious little nanobots, you can potentially distribute them to precisely where they will do most damage, through air and water utility networks.14 Air conditioning duct networks seem as if they were designed expressly for this purpose; they provide efficient conduits from conveniently accessible intakes to all the inhabited spaces of a building, bypassing guards and locked doors. In this case, the distributed siege points (now being put in place, in some contexts, as the danger is recognized) are filters, valves, and electronic sensors designed to sniff out and divert threats. Finally, the miniaturization of destructive power has extended the possibility of infiltration to all forms of transportation networks. The Unabomber did not need B 52s or million dollar missiles to deliver heavy bombs; he could use the mail system to put sufficiently deadly quantities of explosives right into the hands of his victims. For anthrax spores, the mailed packages can be even smaller. If you are prepared to be a suicide bomber, you can just drive a car, hail a cab, or take the bus to your destination. If you can get your hands on a van or truck, you can take a fertilizer bomb to a building\u2019s loading dock or underground garage, or simply drive it at the front door\u2014 hence the rows of bollards, Jersey barriers, and other ad hoc fortifications that now deface many urban landscapes. If you can compromise shipping containers, you can probably deliver nuclear weapons into the hearts of major cities.15 And, particularly in the aftermath of the September 11 hijackings, airport check in gates have become the most vivid and obtrusive reminders of the emerging state of distributed siege. The densely, globally networked world is emphatically not (as early cyberspace utopians had sometimes imagined) inherently one of self regulating, libertarian harmony. The proliferation and geographic distribution of access points\u2014the very essence of the benefits of networks\u2014also multiplies and distributes opportunities to create threats to the safety and well being of those who have come to rely upon network capabilities. The entry barriers often aren\u2019t high; you can fashion many network friendly destructive devices without much specialized knowledge, skill, or resources, and download or order much of what you need from the Internet. (As Martin Amis wrote in the immediate aftermath of September 11, \"A score or so of Stanley knives produced two million tons of rubble.\u201d)16 High speed, efficient transfers within networks make these threats very difficult to localize and isolate, so that destructive effects may be felt far from the site of an initial security breach. And effective, inexpensive, widely deployable filters and barriers are not easy to devise.17 The characteristic fear of our times is no longer of the barbarians beyond the gates (or beyond the Cold War missile shield), but of foreign bodies networked into our midst.18 In the context of transportation networks and human movement, it manifests itself in the understandable fear of the terrorist infiltrator and the suicide bomber, and in the indefensible (sometimes overlapping) ugliness of antiimmigrant, anti refugee, and anti minority demagoguery; the associated pathologies are closed borders, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing. At another level, it is the fear that containers and vehicles\u2014from letters to airliners\u2014will be infiltrated, hijacked, or redirected to serve as carriers of explosives and toxins. Within communication networks, it is the fear of viruses, worms, hackers, and crackers. And within networks of water and air transfer, and body to body contact, it is the fear of deadly contagion. DISPERSAL AND SWARMING If you don\u2019t want to be an easy and perpetually anxious target in a world of networks and distributed siege, one of your best strategies is to decentralize. Instead of concentrating your business organization in a conspicuous downtown office tower, you might disperse it to a collection of electronically interconnected suburban locations. Instead of running your terrorist organization from a base that is subject to preemptive and retaliatory attack, you might create a network and scatter its members throughout the community. In both cases, however, there is something to lose; intercommunication becomes more difficult and less effective, scale economies may disappear, and loss of regular face to face contact may result in decline in trust and cohesion among your members. But as the effectiveness of telecommunication increases and the risks of centralization increase, the balance may shift in favor of greater dispersal. The events of September 11 drove home the lesson that centralizing an organization at one location, such as a skyscraper carrying the corporate logo, does make it terribly vulnerable. As one New York real estate manager commented in the wake of the World Trade Center attack, \"I\u2019m not sure that tall trophy office buildings will ever be popular again.\u201d19 And as William Safire proposed in his op ed column: \"We\u2019re a big, roomy country. Physically decentralized government, tied together electronically, would be the strength of our nation if DC were paralyzed.\u201d20 These responses were probably exaggerated (particularly by anti urban conservatives), but it was clear that the tradeoffs in the balance of centralization versus dispersal would henceforth be evaluated differently.21 Technically, the agglomeration economies that motivate the clustering of functions within organizations, and of businesses in industrial clusters, are offset by the risks of intense spatial concentration. Where the benefits of agglomeration remain high relative to the risks of natural disasters, localized network failures (such as power blackouts), or terrorist attacks, clusters are likely to remain. But, where the risks of agglomeration are higher relative to the benefits (and, perhaps, where these risks are reflected in insurance rates and taxes to support protective services\u2014the so called terrorism tax), and where efficient network interconnection reduces the advantages of agglomeration, organizations are more likely to spread risk through decentralization. By taking advantage of wireless connection and miniaturized, portable equipment, you can add the strategic benefits of mobility to those of dispersal. Decentralization is by no means an entirely new idea among theorists of conflict and combatants. There have long been scattered, mobile guerrillas, irregulars, and resistance groups, but inexpensive, efficient, mobile telecommunication adds a new dimension to their operations; such groups can now act in much more effectively coordinated ways. In offensive mode, they can mount simultaneous attacks on key nodes in widely dispersed networks, such as the servers and switching hubs of a computer network, or the transformer stations of a power grid. They can converge on a target, in coordinated fashion, from many directions at once. And they can swarm\u2014suddenly and unexpectedly materializing at some location in order to accomplish their goal, then rapidly dispersing to avoid containment or retaliation. Electronically coordinated street demonstrators at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle demonstrated the efficacy of swarming,22 and the Critical Mass anticar bicyclists in the San Francisco Bay Area have done even better at suddenly appearing out of nowhere to \"cork\u201d intersections and choke traffic.23 \"Swarm warfare\u201d has become a fashionable topic among security analysts.24 The same technique could extend to telecommunication infrastructure. Even where nodes are multiplied and widely distributed, as with the Internet and cellular systems, they remain fixed targets. If nodes become wireless and mobile, however, the network itself transforms into a swarm that can rapidly reconfigure, elude attack, and move into areas of damage to restore service. After the 1994 North ridge earthquake, for example, cellphone providers developed a strategy of deploying trailer mounted mobile cell sites, together with temporary, point to point microwave links to replace lost landlines and rapidly restore service in damaged zones. After September 11 in New York, this strategy was effectively used to reconstruct cellphone coverage and reweave it into the larger network. And military strategists have begun to contemplate swarms of collaborating, robotic aircraft interconnected by an \"Internet in the sky.\u201d25 REPLICATION AND REPLACEABILITY If dispersal, mobility, and elusiveness do not sufficiently reduce your vulnerability, you might turn to replication and replaceability. This is not a new idea either; generals have frequently been prepared to throw replaceable foot soldiers into the breach, automobiles have reserve tanks, and building codes require alternative fire exits in case one gets blocked. But the availability of cheap, plentiful electronic devices gives the idea a new spin. The Internet, for example, is built from relatively inexpensive channels and switches\u2014which make extensive redundancy feasible and thus enable routing around damage sites. Even better, a mobile, ad hoc network, supported by portable, disposable wireless devices, would combine the advantages of fluidity and redundancy. This would be particularly difficult for enemies to take out as nodes could be scattered quickly around, they would not have fixed locations, and a lot of them would have to be found and eliminated to disable the network. If they did succeed in destroying some nodes, new ones would just pop up anyway. Defensive strategies that rely upon redundancy work even better with software than with hardware, since software can quickly and inexpensively be replicated, and the process of replication can readily be decentralized. Thus file backup and distribution of backup copies to distant locations have become standard practice. Once, you backed up your PC by saving work to floppy disks or tapes; now, increasingly, backup is a network function. Whenever you send an email, for example, you create copies on multiple servers, and those servers are automatically backed up at regular intervals. When you work on a networked computer, it is increasingly difficult to assure, when you wish to do so, that a file you create is not getting backed up somewhere. Organizations that rely upon digital data and cannot afford downtime frequently create redundant sites with both duplicate hardware and replicated data. Financial firms, in particular, have come to depend upon backup \"hot sites\u201d\u2014with duplicate hardware, replicated software and data, and a crew of operators\u2014that are ready to take over at a moment\u2019s notice. When the Lehman Brothers Manhattan data center was destroyed in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, the chief technology officer was able to activate a backup facility in New Jersey, from his Blackberry text messenger, while escaping down the stairs. The firm was trading again the next day.26 By noon on the eleventh, all major New York banks had activated their disaster recovery plans. Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 700 employees, was trading from backup centers in New Jersey and London when the bond market reopened two days later.27 Many other affected financial firms used their disaster recovery contactors (SunGard, Comdisco, and others) to retrieve data from off site backup locations.28 But law firms, which depended more upon original documents on paper, recovered with much more difficulty. And at least one architecture firm, which did not have off site backup, had to retrieve files piecemeal from the servers of its collaborators and consultants. If instant recovery capacity is not necessary, backup sites can disperse over great distances. But where large amounts of data must be transferred to and from backup sites, and where high speed recovery is imperative, network capacity limits dispersal. Thus, for example, the ESCON protocol used by IBM mainframes to connect to remote mass storage devices is limited to about a forty kilometer radius. And the backup sites for Manhattan financial firms are mostly to be found elsewhere in Manhattan, in New Jersey, and in Brooklyn. Since September 2001, however, there has been heightened interest in putting distance into distributed computing architectures, so that computer clusters can extend beyond potential disaster footprints. This requires combination of high speed data links capable of operating over hundreds of kilometers with servers and storage systems designed to absorb increased load and to continue operating seamlessly when some of the nodes in the cluster go down. It seems likely that this sort of enterprise continuity technology will continue to develop.29 Switching to a backup site is not, of course, a possibility for the small lunch place adjacent to the large financial firm. In fact, the electronic relocation of its neighbor\u2019s center of activity may be disastrous for the lunch place, leaving it without customers. Strategies of electronic backup and redundancy are powerful, but their effects are differential. SELF REPLICATION AND MUTATION You can shift this principle to a metalevel; the process of replication and dispersal can, itself, be replicated, dispersed, and mobilized. This makes it more robust than a process centralized at a single, potentially vulnerable production facility. Parasites, bacteria, and viruses provide the model for this; under favorable conditions they are self replicating, and they can distribute themselves simultaneously through multiple channels, making them particularly difficult to stamp out. Since the operation of writing information in memory is fundamental to digital computation, the logic of replication quickly manifested itself on early computers. Programmers learned to code loops that would write the same information repeatedly into memory\u2014 rapidly filling it to overflowing. With slightly trickier logic, and abandonment of the distinction between program and data (easy in languages like Lisp), they could write chunks of code that replicated themselves. At this stage, the worst outcome of out of control replication was crashing an isolated computer\u2014and you could fix the damage by rebooting. But the interconnection of computers into networks instantly changed that. It became possible to send destructive code from computer to computer\u2014either explicitly, or more insidiously, by clandestinely attaching it to email or other transfers. Furthermore, it was quite trivial to write code that automatically replicated itself whenever it landed on a new host, then attached itself to outgoing email to propagate further. Thus in the Internet era computer viruses successfully imitated their biological predecessors. Mobile, self replicating code can be benign (like many biological viruses), and it can even provide an efficient way of performing useful functions on a large scale, but it can also wreak destruction. As Internet users have discovered to their chagrin, maliciously circulated viruses can overwrite memory, erase files, make software misbehave, display offensive messages, take over your machine to attack other machines, or simply crash your system. The varieties of damage that viruses can inflict are limited only by the imagination and technical skill (and it often doesn\u2019t take a lot) of programmers with bad intentions and network connections. By now a standard (indeed, often essential) defense against viruses is software that scans incoming mail to detect and block attached viruses and also scans disks to detect and eliminate any viruses that may have lodged there. But the difficulties are just like those encountered with defenses against biological viruses\u2014you need different remedies for different viruses, there is a continual threat of new viruses for which no defenses exist, and some viruses may replicate themselves with mutations that allow them to elude the defenses. Thus there is a problem of scale and complexity and an ongoing, escalating battle between virus and antivirus forces. Code replication not only provides the means to propagate viruses, it also provides a way to amass forces for sudden, large scale attacks from multiple directions. In distributed denial of service attacks on Internet servers, hackers surreptitiously take over many machines, then employ them simultaneously to fire streams of packets at target servers, thus overloading and bringing them down. Furthermore, denial of service attacks can be directed not just at a single server, but at multiple servers all at once, potentially providing a way to overcome the Internet\u2019s defensive redundancy. In October 2002, for example, a denial of service attack was directed against nine of the Internet\u2019s thirteen root servers scattered around the globe.30 A sustained, successful denial of service attack on all thirteen of the root servers would crash the Internet. BEYOND INTERNET VIRUSES By destroying digital resources, disabling the computers we have come to rely upon, and disrupting communications, Internet viruses can inflict immense economic damage, but they mostly aren\u2019t a direct threat to human life and safety. However, this will change as embedded networked devices proliferate, as our bodies become network nodes, and as transportation, power distribution, water, and air supply networks are increasingly intertwined with telecommunication networks. The price we will pay for integration and intelligent management of large scale networks is that of continuously and resourcefully defending them against more and more potent virus threats. Furthermore, as capacity for fabrication of physical artifacts shifts from centralized factories to small scale, networked, personal fabrication facilities, traditional monopolies on production and distribution of weapons begin to break down. Personal fabrication of printed texts, toys, or electronic components may be unambiguously a good thing, but personal fabrication of guns and bombs, from downloaded designs and apparently innocuous materials electronically ordered from scattered suppliers, certainly is not. Personal biotech nology\u2014maybe the fabrication of viruses from online genetic information and mail order supplies\u2014is even scarier. By 2002 researchers had, for example, fabricated infectious polioviruses using a publicly available genome sequence, inert chemicals, and modest laboratory equipment.31 Self replicating nanobots (which eliminate the distinction between production machinery and the products of that machinery) are not inconceivable\u2014though many scientists are skeptical. And the most apocalyptic scenario is of a world suddenly overwhelmed by runaway, self replicating gray goo. As Bill Joy has suggested, we now have the possibility \"not just of weapons of mass destruction but of knowledge enabled mass destruction (KMD), this destructiveness hugely amplified by the power of self replication.\u201d32 Where cities from Troy to Palma Nova defended their encircling walls, New York and other twenty first century cities must defend their distributed networks against accident and attack. They must protect physical network infrastructure against destruction not only locally but also to far flung extremities. They must ensure that there is sufficient redundancy in vital networks to prevent their being vulnerable to failure through destruction of a few key nodes or links. They must introduce circuit breakers, relief valves, and similar protections against failure propagation. They must find effective ways to guard against introduction of explosives, toxins, bioagents, portable code, and other destructive agents, and to guard against hijacking of vehicles, servers, and similar delivery devices. And cities must contend with both threats of physical destruction and threats to the logical integrity of networks from viruses, worms, software attack tools, and the like. Conversely, if cities can keep their networks operating in times of disaster, they can quickly mobilize regenerative resources. Transportation networks can bring in relief supplies from distant parts of the globe. Mobile wireless nodes can swiftly restore telecommunications. And, increasingly, high speed digital linkages to distant backup sites and geographically distributed enterprises can keep economic activity cranking along. Traditionally, there was safety in numbers and in surrounding walls. Now urban security and resilience are grounded in patterns of connectivity. And defensive rings have fragmented and recombined. They no longer surround entire settlements and separate them from the countryside; rather, they enclose countless, scattered network access points\u2014from airport departure gates to password protected personal computers. 12 LOGIC PRISONS According to popular lore (and numerous unfortunate jokes), Saint Peter stands guard at the pearly gates, downloads your lifetime track record when you show up looking for admission to the Heavenly City, and decides whether you get access privileges or not. Similarly, Cerberus provides the underground with security against unauthorized entry by the likes of Orpheus. Today, electronic control of movement among physical and online spaces works in much the same way. You had better be on the authorized user list if you want to get in to a secure Web site or access an ATM machine. And your profile had better not match that of the bad guys if you want to get on an airplane. Technologies of surveillance and data collection, pattern recognition and data mining, and identity management have now converged with those of access management to enable formidable new systems of social control. At the core of these systems are access control lists, and their inverse, blacklists. Such lists include and exclude, distinguish friend from adversary, and in doing so construct political identity. To create them is to exercise power, and to be on them (or not) is to be subject to power. ELECTRONIC ACCESS CONTROL The idea of an access control list first arose, in its modern, digital form, in the early days of multiuser computing.1 Users did not want others to be able to mess with their files, so operating systems were designed to keep track of the users who could read from, write to, or copy particular files. Essentially, operating systems maintained tables listing users along one axis, and files along the other, with entries specifying whether access was to be allowed or not.2 A row listed the files a particular user could access, and a column listed the users who could access a particular file. And there were caste systems; the most privileged users got access to everything, the least privileged got very little. Classification simplified this management task. If managers could formulate policies in terms of broad classes of users rather than individuals, and classes of things to be accessed, they could quickly reduce the sizes of access control tables and the complexity of associated management tables. They could establish and enforce general rules, for example, that only high level staff within an organization could access files of salary data or enter the card keyed executive dining room. As large computer networks developed, access control systems became even more crucial. Since anyone might potentially access a site from anywhere in the network (anywhere in the world, in the case of the Internet), it was imperative to define, for each particular site, precisely who was allowed to do so; if you didn\u2019t, it was like leaving your front door unlocked to the whole world. In online communities, and persistent multiuser games\u2014which might engage millions\u2014the associated caste systems often evolved into elaborate structures that expressed themselves in terms of ability to change features of the shared environment. Lowly users might dress and drive their avatars, but more privileged ones might create persistent architecture, and the most privileged might alter the very infrastructure and rules of the game. Where code is the law, access to code makes you legislator and law enforcement. Furthermore, malicious hackers have now become much more sophisticated and have figured out that that they do not need to rattle doorknobs electronically themselves; they can write code to search automatically through the Internet for vulnerable machines to crack. So access control has become not just a matter of managing human users, but also of fending off automated break in attempts. The scale and complexity of the access management problem has rapidly grown. Today, as more and more devices get embedded intelligence and IP addresses, access control lists are extending their power into the everyday physical world. They have accomplished a species jump, from cyberspace to architecture. This has been prompted, in part, by the spread of embedded intelligence. If a home appliance has a processor and an IP address, it becomes potentially hackable (a Bulgarian teenager could reset your alarm clock, lock your air conditioner at a teeth chattering temperature, turn all your audio devices up to maximum volume, and flash your living room lights on and off), so it needs access control. Thus your domestic access control lists begin to define who, physically or telepresently, is welcome in your house. The same goes for your automobile: instead of keys, future automobiles will probably have lists of authorized drivers. In general, locks on gates and doors are evolving from metal to metal mechanisms to programmable electromechanical devices. They are increasingly being networked; and they are also getting lists of authorized users. (Instead of turning a key in a hotel room door, you swipe a card.) In other words, the technologies of access control in physical space and cyberspace\u2014once very distinct\u2014are converging. And so, of course, are the possibilities of misuse and abuse. Governments might control citizen movement by instantly reprogramming physical access to public spaces or by using electronic road pricing systems to create electronic cordons that are prohibitively expensive to cross, police in pursuit of fugitives might create instant holding cells around them, management engaged in labor disputes might program electronic lockouts, merchants might automatically exclude you from their stores if your credit isn\u2019t good enough, and burglars might simply reprogram your front door. Furthermore, delivery of access control, like that of many other functions, can migrate from architectural elements to portable, wireless devices. Parolees, for example, may now be required to strap GPS enabled tracking devices to their ankles.3 Supervisors can establish exclusion and inclusion zones for each offender. According to the American Probation and Parole Association\u2019s manual on electronic offender supervision technology, \"Exclusion zones are areas the offender is not permitted to go, such as parks and schools for a pedophile, a former partner\u2019s home or place of employment for a domestic batterer, or bars for an alcoholic.... Inclusion zones are areas the offender is expected to be at various times, such as his workplace during the day and home at night.\u201d The inclusion and exclusion zones are entered on a screen displayed map, and the system transmits an alert \"any time the offender enters an exclusion zone or leaves an inclusion zone at the wrong time.\u201d These systems can be extended to monitor for alcohol and blood consumption, and it is not difficult to imagine versions that could deliver painful electric shocks (a technique already used on dogs) or immobilizing drugs whenever a location or behavioral violation is detected. But the technical details of electronic access control are not, in the end, the crucial issue; you can accomplish much the same results by putting the functionality into the architecture or attaching it to people. It is far more important to focus upon the specifics of access control policies in particular contexts\u2014and on who has the authority to implement them. IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION For good or ill, access control lists are simple and powerful, but they suffer from the obvious problem that names are not reliably unique; a glance at any large telephone directory or payroll file will confirm this. A related problem is that naming authorities may have overlapping jurisdictions and inconsistent policies. The remedy favored by armies, corporations, and some central governments is to issue everyone a unique serial number.4 (The ancillary consequence is that, if you don\u2019t have a number, you\u2019re a nonperson.) This is a straightforward technical solution, but it may invest far too much power for comfort in the issuing organization. An even more serious problem is that names may be stolen; someone seeking access may not be who he claims to be.5 Generally, then, access control systems require you to verify your identity in some way. A standard authentication strategy is to request some piece of information that a random access seeker is not likely to possess, such as your mother\u2019s maiden name, and to check this against information that you have previously supplied. A now familiar variant, where better security is required, is to request a secret password\u2014but, as most of us have discovered, it is easy to forget or confuse passwords, and it is easy to write software that will cycle through permutations of characters to find a password that works. A yet more sophisticated approach is to encrypt information and require a secret key to decrypt it. But even encryption, in the end, just shifts the problem to another level; just as you can steal a name, you can (usually, admittedly, with a bit more difficulty) steal a password or a key as well. Instead of requesting information you carry in your head, an access management system can demand some physical thing you carry in your pocket. In the pre electronic era, this might have taken the form of a letter of introduction (maybe with a wax seal), a passport, an ID card, or a metal key that you inserted into a matching lock\u2014 all of which, of course, might be lost, stolen, faked, or duplicated. Today it is likely to bear a barcode, a magnetic stripe, a memory chip that encodes digital information, or a mechanism that performs the cryptographic task of computing a one way function.6 Thus, for example, you access an ATM machine, a hotel room, or a card keyed building by swiping a plastic card. With this strategy, you can end up carrying many different cards and other physical identifiers in your pockets, and you are in deep trouble if your identification tokens are lost or stolen. Finally, an access management system might not be concerned with what people possess, but might rely on measuring what they are \u2014 for example, by automatically matching their fingerprints.7 This biometric strategy requires technology for quickly and accurately measuring biological characteristics, storing profiles that identify individuals, and matching profiles of access seekers against stored profiles. Electronic fingerprinting devices, hand geometry assayers, face recognition systems, and iris and retina scanners have all been employed for this purpose. Success so far has been mixed, but there is little reason to doubt that the technology will continue to improve. Short of having your hands chopped off or your eyeballs poked out, you cannot accidentally lose your biometric identifiers, and it is usually difficult and painful to remove them deliberately. (It\u2019s not like cutting up a credit card.) Still, you can fool biometric systems with masks, gloves, and prostheses, and a clever makeup artist might steal your face, which, unlike a credit card, you cannot have reissued. None of these basic authentication strategies solves the problem of the attacker who somehow breaches the defenses and then (like the soldiers hidden in the Trojan horse) has free reign to cause damage. So some of the most advanced security systems now check credentials electronically at frequent intervals. To stay logged into a particularly sensitive computer system, for example, you may need a pocket wireless device that continually transmits random numbers that match numbers stored in the access management system. If the transmission falters, or the numbers do not match, you instantly get disconnected. For access managers\u2014from systems operators to border guards\u2014effective combinations of these identification and authentication strategies are increasingly crucial to success. For users of buildings and systems, and citizens of cities, the capacity to electronically verify one\u2019s right to use a name\u2014in multiple contexts and over extended time periods\u2014is now essential. Without such capacity, in a digitally networked environment with electronically managed access, there can be no freedom of movement and action. IDENTITY IN MULTIPLE CONTEXTS Most of us, in our daily lives, need access to many different physical and online places. Consequently, we must carry numerous access devices and remember multiple IDs and passwords. These may need to be updated as we change employers or affiliations, and as organizations merge, move, or reorganize. And the difficulties can be complicated by the use of different names in different contexts\u2014perhaps a full, formal name as shown on your birth certificate and passport, a nickname at your local bar, a writer\u2019s pseudonym, a stage name, a vanity license plate, and different avatars and handles in different online environments. Not only is this condition a potential source of confusion and error, it also introduces annoying and wasteful delays as we are forced to reidentify and reauthenticate ourselves when moving from place to place. As our identities become more complex and multifaceted, they increasingly require sophisticated management, and software is emerging to fill the need. The Microsoft Passport system, for example, is intended for use by Microsoft customers, business partners, and affiliates. It allows you to \"use one name and password to sign in to all.NET Passport participating sites and services.\u201d8 You can sign up to \"store personal information in your.NET Passport profile and, if you choose, automatically share that information when you sign in so that participating sites can provide you with personalized services.\u201d Similarly, the Liberty Alliance Project promises to \"deliver and support a federated network identity solution for the Internet that enables single sign on for consumers as well as business users in an open, federated way.\u201d9 Unlike Microsoft Passport, it does not depend upon a single, central authority to maintain personal information. It proposes, instead, that it will enable businesses and users to manage their own data through the use of an open, interoperable standard for federated network identity. Federated spatial identity might one day be managed in much the same way\u2014emptying your pockets of multiple keys and swipe cards. Another approach, proposed by the National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, would make use of \"clustered IDs.\u201d10 This represents a different tradeoff between the efficiencies of centralization and the privacy and liberty protections of decentralization. It would encourage the development of multiple identity management systems operating across different collections of businesses, government departments, and so on, and would not require a single identifier that followed citizens everywhere. TRACKING AND PROFILING You can explicitly sign up for access to a physical or online site, you can be put on a list (maybe without your knowledge) by an access manager, or more insidiously, you can be put on a blacklist. Lists that emerge in these ways are not static; they are constructed and reconstructed over time, as access managers decide whom to include and exclude. To provide a basis for these decisions, managers collect and record data about individuals\u2014for example, the sorts of data you provide on an employment, driver\u2019s license, credit card, passport, or visa application. Subsequently, they may add information about your activities and behavior, such as traffic violations, purchases and payments, or border crossings. The technology for this developed enormously during the 1990s, as Web activity generated unprecedented quantities of behavioral data and as electronic access control became an increasingly pressing issue.11 To track your activities and behavior, and hold you accountable for them, access managers must be able to identify you and follow your identity through time; that\u2019s why bank robbers and Mardi Gras revelers wear masks\u2014to create \"time outs,\u201d during which they cannot be identified. (And that\u2019s why alibis are also important.) Conversely, electronic announcement of your identity is a form of unmasking and, as such, creates opportunities for tracking and profiling. You explicitly generate such opportunities whenever you assert and authenticate your identity by providing a password or swiping a card. And you implicitly produce them when you carry RFID devices: if cars have transponders, you can electronically check who\u2019s in your parking lot, and if students in a classroom have RFID tags, teachers can electronically take attendance. Some biometric systems, such as face recognizers, also make identity electronically observable. At the extreme, GPS equipped offender supervision systems can create continuous traces of where the wearer has been, and when. Your activities online already get tracked routinely, and in detail. Whenever you log into a site as an authorized user, the files you access and the times you access them will be recorded\u2014and system administrators will be able to trace through the log to see who you are and what you have been up to. (To facilitate this, many Web sites require you to register.) On electronic commerce sites, the record of your transactions becomes a valuable marketing tool. Even if you just use a browser to enter a publicly accessible Web site, you will deposit more information about your identity in the site\u2019s log file than you may imagine, and your activities on the site will be tracked.12 Everywhere in cyberspace, you leave electronic footprints. The point was vividly dramatized when, in April 2002, a Princeton admissions officer clandestinely entered a password protected Yale admissions decision Web site. The Yale system administrators traced back the source of the intrusion, and it was soon all over the 13 newspapers. As electronic identification is increasingly required for access to physical spaces as well as online ones, electronic tracking inexorably follows. It is often needed for billing purposes, and of course it may be put to other uses as well. Your monthly credit card bill may list the times and places at which your transponder equipped car passed through checkpoints, just as your cellphone bill lists the locations of calls. Similarly, a workplace that is subdivided into card key accessed rooms can keep detailed track of when employees show up and leave, and where and when employees spend their time at work\u2014and it had better not be too much in the lunchroom or the washroom! In this respect physical space increasingly resembles cyberspace. DATA WAREHOUSES It might logically seem that all these electronic activity records would remain associated with the sites and organizations that collect them, to be used only in those particular contexts. This has traditionally been the case; employers, retailers, educational institutions, credit agencies, license issuers, and immigration authorities have all maintained their separate databases, and it has not been easy to consolidate them. This provides a natural privacy safeguard; if you don\u2019t want your activities at some physical or online site to be logged, you can simply avoid it\u2014 much as celebrities try to protect their privacy by avoiding being seen in public places. Another possibility is that databases will increasingly be consolidated in data warehouses\u2014thus creating more comprehensive logs of user activities and reducing the likelihood that users can escape the net. (Advocates like to use the jargon of eliminating data \u201cstovepipes\u201d\u2014implying that it is just about business efficiency.) Nationwide identity cards and numbers greatly facilitate warehousing. Such consolidation has generally been opposed by privacy advocates, and centralized, consolidated databases would provide attractive targets for break in attempts and denial of service attacks. However, nationwide identification systems and large scale data warehousing have had more advocates since September 2001\u2014particularly in the United States.14 It is also possible that databases will not be formally consolidated, but that resourceful programmers who gain access to multiple sites (either legally or illegally) will be able to link an individual\u2019s disparate records to construct a single record. The more common elements (such as names, addresses, and ID numbers) there are in different databases, the easier this ad hoc correlation becomes. It seems most likely that personal data management will eventually evolve into a complex, distributed function in which some data are collected and managed at the physical and online sites you visit, some are maintained personally (much as you may now maintain resumes and personal Web pages), and some are maintained by trusted third parties who are in the business of guaranteeing completeness and accuracy. There will be associated, potentially regulated practices of transferring data among repositories, and correlating and crosschecking data from different sources. One way or another, though, as an inhabitant of an electronically networked world, you not only have a verifiable name, you have extensive records of your background and past actions associated with that name. Your reputation depends upon these records, you may be held accountable for them in various ways, and you may end up negotiating the conditions under which these records are constructed, accessed, and interrelated. Large scale database consolidation is not just a matter of technical efficiency; it fundamentally changes the conditions of urban life. Until recently, personal privacy depended heavily upon scale effects; small, traditional villages mostly provided very little of it, but large, modern cities allowed the possibility of disappearing into the anonymous masses. It also depended upon the localization of knowledge; if you wanted to leave your sordid small town past behind, you could run off to join the French Foreign Legion, or just move to L.A. Now, in the global village, electronic data collection, storage, correlation and analysis technologies, combined with high speed electronic transfer of information, have radically shifted the natural balance of power in favor of snoopers and list makers. Unless rigorously enforced privacy policies intervene, computer power overcomes scale, and networks defeat distance. Once access managers have databases resulting from surveillance or tracking, they can implement software that looks for matches to things that interest them.15 If they capture facial images of passengers passing through an airport security checkpoint, for example, they can check for close matches to photographs of suspected terrorists. Algorithms that perform this task are statistically based, so it is necessary to set a threshold of similarity. If this threshold is too high, they can expect relatively few positive matches, and there is a high likelihood that actual terrorists will slip through unrecognized. If it is too low, they will get a large number of false alarms, and, like the boy who cried wolf, the system will lose credibility. More abstractly, access managers can look for digital signatures in data about personal characteristics and behavior. This is like searching for a few unusually shaped straws in a large haystack, but sophisticated analysis techniques combined with massive computing power make it increasingly feasible. For example, the U.S. Transportation Security Agency has pursued development of a passenger profiling system known as CAPPS II.16 Credit card companies have long analyzed patterns of card use in order to detect fraud. And financial institutions have begun to monitor and correlate customer activity and to report suspicious patterns to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.17 Of course, it all depends upon the definitions of target signatures\u2014on what particular access managers might mean by \"dangerous\u201d or \"suspicious.\u201d It is not always necessary to predefine patterns of interest. For decades, numerical taxonomists and cluster analysts have computed measures of similarity among digital descriptions of things (such as customer activity profiles) and have used these measures to construct similarity classes. Online retailers, in particular, have learned to sort customers into groups with similar buying habits and to use this information for pinpoint marketing\u2014recommending books and CDs when you log on to a retail site, for example. This is harmless enough when you find yourself clustered with purchasers of, say, English romantic poetry, but you may attract unwelcome attention if you get grouped with purchasers of bomb making manuals and extremist political tracts. It is also possible to extract pertinent facts from a behavioral profile, add rules, and apply an inference engine to derive potentially telling conclusions. For example, a system might infer that a car was speeding from the time intervals between charges at turnpike toll booths. Or it might infer that someone had made a plane journey from the short time intervals between cellphone calls from widely separated cities. Precrime does not require mutants floating in vats, as in Minority Report \u2014just a database, rules and profiles, inference engines, and data mining algorithms. And, if the conclusions they draw are not one hundred percent accurate, then that can always be dismissed as collateral damage\u2014unfortunate, but justified by the end result. SCIENTIA EST POTENTIA In the past, defenders of places and populations could mostly depend upon more traditional strategies for distinguishing between friends and adversaries. The matter could often be settled, very simply, by relationship to physical boundaries; if you were inside the city walls, the default assumption was that you were one of us, but if you were outside, you were presumed to be one of them. Sometimes, as well, it could be determined by ethnic or gender markers, or by military uni forms\u2014blue versus gray, red coats, red shirts, brown shirts, and black shirts. But in a networked world, foes are sometimes shadowy, spatially dispersed, and mobile.18 You cannot look down at them from the ramparts, they don\u2019t have evident concentrations of fixed assets, and there aren\u2019t obvious targets to bomb. So governments that need to protect their citizens from them must first construct their identities: it doesn\u2019t help to declare war on an abstract noun such as \u201cterrorism\u201d unless there is some algorithm\u2014increasingly likely to be one that is applied to electronic traces of activities\u2014for enumerating and locating members of the class of terrorists. Otherwise, the Onions famous 9/11 story, \u201cU.S. Vows to Defeat Whoever It Is We\u2019re at War With,\u201d becomes all too prescient.19 And governments are quickly getting it\u2014though not necessarily getting it right. After September 11, 2001, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) set up an Information Awareness Office headed by the scary spook John Poindexter.20 The IAO\u2019s publicly announced plans were to build a vast warehouse of personal data about individuals and to apply data mining and pattern recognition techniques to sniff out suspicious patterns of activity and electronically identify enemies.21 Somebody at the agency got carried away with Photoshop: the Web site shows a variant on the great seal of the United States (as depicted on dollar bills), with an eye peeking out of a pyramid to scan the entire globe\u2014a panoptic diagram that would have left Jeremy Bentham gobsmacked and Michel Foucault grabbing for his deconstructor. Around it is inscribed the motto Scientia est Potentia \u2014knowledge is power.22 Indeed. But without vigorous, critical scrutiny of such power, there will be no clear boundary between protective and repressive uses of electronic surveillance and access control technologies. Communication networks are meant to be liberating, but they can also be used to construct personalized logic prisons for all of us. Logic prisons define zones of inclusion and exclusion in both cyberspace and physical space. They are built not from stones and bars, but from access management lists, software, and electronic gadgets ranging from RFID tags and GPS anklets to card key access locks. The guards aren\u2019t in watchtowers. They rely upon networked surveillance and tracking systems, data warehouses, and pattern recognition and data mining systems. And they exert their power through denial of access, apprehension at electronically managed checkpoints, and, where necessary, electronic fingering for arrest, immobilization, or elimination. Next time you want to go somewhere, think of your friendly access manager. He\u2019s making a list, and checking it twice\u2014gonna find out who\u2019s naughty and nice. Unless we are prepared to resist it, the logic prison is coming to town. EPILOGUE As early explorers of the southern oceans approached wild, dark shores, they were sometimes startled by the sight of campfires beyond the breakers. In 1520 Ferdinand Magellan named Tierra del Fuego (land of fire) for the numerous blazes that he observed there. And in 1773, for similar reasons, Tobias Furneaux named the Bay of Fires on the northern coast of Tasmania. If you walk the shores of the Bay of Fires today, you can still see the hints and traces of a tragically vanished nomadic people. There are ancient shell middens among the cliffs. At the freshwater lagoons behind the dunes, near to the feeding grounds of wallabies and kangaroos, the now silent campsites remain inviting. The fires and smoke plumes that impressed Furneaux were, for the brief moments that they flared into warmth and light, the centers of mobile communities\u2014 places where people gathered, talked, cooked, slept, and cared for one another. For such nomads, the most basic and obvious ethical principle\u2014 and one crucial to social cohesion\u2014must have been that of reciprocity: take responsibility for the welfare of others in the group because you expect them to do the same for you.1 The sense of collective enterprise and mutual obligation tempered self interest. But application of the principle of reciprocity was strictly geographically bounded: it would be hard to argue that the moral obligations of group members extended far beyond the circle of warmth\u2014to include, say, the citizens of London, or even the inhabitants of the Australian mainland on the far side of the strait to the north. The Tasmanian aborigines had been completely isolated for thousands of years. There was literally no connection to the outside world.2 The inhabitants of the Bay of Fires did not know of these distant people and could take no actions that affected them. NETWORKS OF RECIPROCITY The navigators saw the world differently. They were engaged in constructing a network of sea transportation routes that was to blanket the globe and form increasingly important linkages among remotely situated people. And these linkages, as those who took the trouble to reflect upon the question began to realize, affected the extension of reciprocity. The expanding circle of contact, trade, and capacity to do good and harm might have suggested that mere distance no longer made a moral difference, and indeed the seafaring eighteenth century was that of the first declarations of universal human rights. But the Victorian moral philosopher Henry Sidgwick was to give an answer more typical of the emerging colonial era, as follows: We should all agree that each of us is bound to show kindness to his parents and spouse and children, and to other kinsmen in a less degree: and to those who have rendered services to him, and any others whom he may have admitted to his intimacy and called friends: and to neighbors and to fellow countrymen more than others: and perhaps we may say to those of our own race more than to black or yellow men, and generally to human beings in proportion to their affinity to ourselves.3 Implicit in Sidgwick\u2019s argument is the idea that moral obligation to one\u2019s fellow human beings rapidly diminishes with distance. In Sidgwick\u2019s world, parents, spouse, and children were likely to be very close at hand\u2014probably in the same house. Other relatives, neighbors, and friends formed a wider geographic circle\u2014mostly in the same town. Fellow countrymen constituted a wider circle still, and those of other countries were very distant: the black people of Tasmania were a voyage of many months away. Casual racism aside, Sidgwick\u2019s analysis made considerable practical sense. Social groups and communities were largely place based, and webs of mutual aid attenuated as they spread out from their centers, so it was reasonable enough to argue that obligation did as well. You had many obligations to those with whom you interacted intensely, over extended periods, but fewer to those with whom your interactions were limited or blocked by the impedance (some would say the tyranny) of distance. But the racism that Sidgwick embraced turned out, of course, to be far from harmless. The ever extending network of sea routes had, by then, brought Europeans and Tasmanians into close contact. And the argument that native Tasmanians had \"little affinity to ourselves\u201d was being used by European settlers to justify their extermination. Change the material basis of ethical principles\u2014in particular, technologies of interconnection and networking\u2014and the consequences may be momentous. SCALING COMMUNITY It is easy to see how networks of mutual obligation work in small bands and settlements, where people recognize one another. You can tell your friends from your enemies, grudges and favors matter, and it is important to protect your reputation. But what happens when villages grow into large cities? Both Plato and Aristotle argued that the social glue breaks down at the point where citizens become strangers to one another, so communities should not scale up beyond that. In his Laws, Plato suggested that the population of an ideal city state should not exceed about 5,000 citizen farmers, plus their families and slaves, and a few resident aliens.4 And, in his Politics, Aristotle remarked: \"In order to give decisions on matters of justice, and for the purpose of distributing offices of merit, it is necessary that the citizens should know each other and know what kind of people they are.\u201d5 After pointing out that excessive population also made it \"easy for foreigners and aliens resident in the country to become possessed of citizenship,\u201d he summarized: \"Here then we have ready to hand the best limits of a state: it must have the largest population consistent with catering for the needs of a self sufficient life, but not so large that it cannot be easily surveyed.\u201d In other words, it had to be possible to know your fellow citizens through face to face contact, and to build up webs of mutual aid and obligation through that contact. The central agora, which provided a place for all the citizens to meet, was the material, architectural expression of this idea. Ferdinand Tonnies, pioneering German sociologist and contemporary of Sidgwick, provided a more nuanced suggestion\u2014that the principle of reciprocity began to operate in different ways as settlements grew. Gemeinschaft (community), in his memorable formulation, was characterized by \"intimate, private and exclusive living together\u201d in families, kinship and friendship groups, villages and neighborhoods. Gesellschaft (society), on the other hand, was the \"artificial construction of an aggregate of human beings\u201d\u2014the big, impersonal city.6 It is certainly possible to quarrel with some of the details and subtleties of this distinction, and subsequent sociologists and social theorists have hardly been hesitant to do so, but it seems to me that Tonnies got it roughly right. Gemeinschaft doesn\u2019t scale, but other mechanisms take over. Cities are not just larger than villages: they are materially, socially, and ethically different. Through the close proximities they establish, through shared use of public space, through common dependence upon complex and vulnerable infrastructure, and through joint access to vital networks of limited capacity, the world\u2019s great cities have become zones of dense, inescapable interdependencies among their citizens\u2014most of whom know very little of one another.7 They therefore depend upon sufficient levels of communication, cooperation, and trust among strangers; if this breaks down, cities cease to function. As the beating victim Rodney King famously pleaded in 1992, with Los Angeles exploding in riot and flames around him, \"Can\u2019t we all just get along?\u201d It is not that cities are domains free of difference and conflict: rather, they rely upon the capacities of their highly evolved cultures and institutions\u2014of ballot boxes, legal systems, markets, civil society, critical discourse, and political activism\u2014to domesticate hostility, to constructively manage differences and conflicts, and indeed to generate creative energy from them. In other words, they are not just physical constructions, nor simply facilitators of economic, social, and cultural activity: they are also, crucially if imperfectly, systems of ethically guided interaction contrived according to the Rodney King principle\u2014to allow large numbers of people, who do not necessarily know one another, to get along. ELECTRONICALLY EXPANDING CIRCLES As astronauts orbit the earth today, concentrations of humanity appear to them as glowing hotspots of light, heat, and radio frequency emission\u2014much like campfires on the shore, but many orders of magnitude larger, and extending over a wider band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Within these zones of our Planet of Fires, supported by miniaturized electronics, the new spatial, social, and cultural practices that I have described in these pages are rapidly taking hold. This third millennium pattern is the culmination of a centuries long process of weaving, superimposing, and integrating different types of transportation, energy, and communication networks. Subjects, extended bodies, settlements, economies, and cultures can no longer effectively be separated by skins, walls, and frontiers. They have all become inextricably embedded in dense, large scale webs of interdependence. The child in Boston is socially and culturally linked to his grandmother in Melbourne, the server farm in Palo Alto is economically coupled to the cubicle farm in Bangalore, the cave in Afghanistan threatens the skyscraper in New York. If an outbreak of SARS is not controlled in Hong Kong, the consequences are immediately felt in Toronto. Mobility and interconnectivity on massive scales scramble the neat units and hierarchies described by Henry Sidgwick. Our circles of interaction and mutual obligation cannot be limited to our campsites, immediate neighborhoods, cities, nationstates, or even networks of international trading partners; they are truly and inescapably global. Just as a city is not simply a sprawling village, the networked Planet of Fires is not a global village. Nor is it a virtual city or an extended nation state. Physically, spatially, and morally it is a thing of a new kind\u2014differing as profoundly from the civic arrangements we have known as Gesellschaft does from Gemeinschaft. In principle, we could try to return to a simpler era by limiting the scope of our interactions or by denying that they create moral obligations. Those are the strategies, at different scales and in different ways, of the survivalist, the xenophobe, the isolationist, and the unilateralist. But, as Marx repeatedly argued, humankind never, in the end, rejects more effective means to satisfy its material needs. Few of us will choose to give up our instruments of liberation from what he might have called (had he lived to see it) the idiocy of unconnected life\u2014the narrowly constrained existence imposed by limits of locality, time, memory, and processing power.8 We cannot withdraw to unambiguous home territories behind sealed borders because, in the world we have now made, there are none. And, under this condition of ubiquitous, high speed, unbounded interconnectivity, we surely have no remaining grounds to argue that the principle of reciprocity is extinguished by distance. We are all tied together by our networks\u2014both materially and morally\u2014like climbers on a rope. If we are to reap the benefits of our electronically expanded social, economic, and cultural circles without succumbing to their dangers, we must recognize that they actualize our common humanity. GLIMPSING THE GLOBAL POLIS For the privileged and powerful, this densely and inextricably interconnected world can be a dangerous and frightening place. It must be controlled through total surveillance, comprehensive access management, preemptive arrests and strikes, and electronically administered high tech violence. If you are not with the global superpower in this, then you are against it. For the marginalized and alienated, by contrast, it can provide opportunities to turn networks against their makers through infiltration, subversion, hijacking, and terrorism. For yet others, this world can\u2014and must\u2014provide new opportunities to scale up networks of cooperation and mutual obligation, build borderless communities, and find common cause. The worldwide antiwar demonstrations of 15 February 2003 provided a tantalizing glimpse of this emerging possibility. As far as I can tell, the idea of the demonstrations crystallized at a series of international meetings. Activists discussed it at the European Social Forum in Florence in November 2002, at a follow up meeting in Copenhagen on 15 December, and at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in January 2003. (The World Social Forum, in contrast to the World Economic Forum in Davos, takes a bottom up rather than a top down perspective on responding to globalization.) Of course, all these meetings had associated Web sites, and these published globally accessible calls to action. It was the cyberspace equivalent of nailing a declaration to the cathedral door. Before long, other Web sites throughout the world were publishing details of local demonstrations, and portal sites like stopwar.org.uk were providing hyperlinked directories. Some newspaper sites, such as Guardian Unlimited, quickly got into the act. And the sites began spontaneously cross linking to one another. This tenuous cyberspace construction soon exploded into a huge, densely linked, self organized network. If you entered at any point, you could, within seconds, find details of planned demonstrations at any city that might interest you. And the web of cross linkages provided a strong sense of global solidarity. The capacity for bottom up, uncoordinated growth that had been built into the Internet and the World Wide Web, and that had made them so effective, had been harnessed for new political purposes. On the ground, the demonstrations began in Melbourne, on 14 February, then moved west with the sun. Sydney and other Australian cities followed on 15 February. Many time zones later, the wave hit Europe\u2014Istanbul, Rome, Berlin, Paris, and London kicking off in succession. It reached New York on a bitterly cold Saturday afternoon, then crossed the continent to Los Angeles and San Francisco. There was nothing virtual, immaterial, or dispersed about the events themselves. Their point was to achieve as much mass and density as possible, and to occupy the most prominent public spaces. Generally, they succeeded; in many cities, the crowds were the largest in memory. People put their bodies directly on the line, just as the ancient Greeks had done in the agora. It was face to face, physical, and sweaty. But these crowds were not blind masses, limited as in the past by line of sight; they were electronically coordinated swarms. Cellphones were everywhere. There was constant electronic interchange about evolving conditions and developments, so that the flows through the streets could shift and adapt in response. As the tsunami of assemblies rolled on, and as if to celebrate the centenary of Marconi\u2019s first intercontinental transmission, longdistance electronic telecommunication helped it gather energy. Television reports and news Web sites carried vivid pictures of the events that had already unfolded in earlier time zones, so that those starting out in the next city knew that they were part of a huge global drama. It has long been obvious that market blips can propagate rapidly around the world through electronic networks, producing local consequences at each place they reach. So, it turns out, can political momentum. When the demonstrations of the fifteenth were over, the invisible but powerful infrastructure of Web sites and cross linkages remained. Furthermore, it had been invested, through the physical engagement of millions of people, with a credibility and emotional intensity that it had not attained before. And it was instantly pressed into service for the next phase of the burgeoning campaign; just surf in, and you could find your local point to demonstrate when the bombing began. Or, in a switch to the cyberspace side, you could join the 26 February virtual march on Washington\u2014a Web coordinated blitz of phone calls, faxes, and emails to every Senate office in the country. The New York Times, which had largely ignored the emerging voices of dissent, commented in a front page article that \"there may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion.\u201d9 ETHICAL INTERCONNECTIVITY The \"death of distance\u201d that prophets of telecommunication have repeatedly promised10 does not, as it turns out, destroy the power of place: local cultures and advantages still matter. Nor does it reduce to the extension of consumer service areas\u2014to the convenience of calling your mother from a foreign city, watching CNN from any hotel room, getting cash from any ATM, or surfing the Web from an isolated mountaintop. It means, instead, that zones of networked interdependence are now growing in rapid, unbounded fashion. As they inexorably fuse into a single global system, they confront us with the challenge of imagining and forming extended social aggregates that ",

        "PROLOGUE To honor an approaching centenary, I embarked on an electronic pilgrimage.",
        "Like Ulysses setting sail for Ithaca, I looked to the heavens for guidance.1 I entered \"Marconi Station, Wellfleet, Massachusetts\u201d into my automobile navigation system.",
        "GPS satellites located me, software computed the quickest route, and synthetic voice commands conducted me to a sandy cliff on the shores of Cape Cod.",
        "The motorists whizzing past on Route 6, listening to their radios and casually chatting on their cellphones, didn\u2019t give it a thought, but it was on this windy site (most of which has now fallen into the ocean) that the wireless world began.2 Here, Guglielmo Marconi built four 210 foot towers, spun a spiderweb of wires in the sky, cranked up a kerosene engine to drive a 20,000 volt power supply, and ran a spark gap rotor that could be heard for miles.",
        "On 18 January 1903 (the year in which the Wright brothers were to introduce the world to powered flight), he transmitted a wireless telegraph message across the Atlantic.",
        "Suddenly the continents were connected in a new way.",
        "A century later, global wireless systems brought me to the spot and kept me effortlessly in touch as I stood there.",
        "In my hand I held an inexpensive transmitter and receiver that was immeasurably more sophisticated than Marconi\u2019s immense construction, and could instantly connect me to any one of hundreds of millions of similar devices scattered around the world.",
        "Furthermore, it could link me to the countless servers of the Internet and the Web.",
        "I pulled off the cover (no doubt voiding the warranty) to reveal a palm sized, precisely made architectural model; the powerhouse had shrunk to a matchbook scaled battery, the transmission house now resided on a chip, and the antenna tower was just a couple of inches long.",
        "It seemed that Brobdingnag had been rebooted as Lilliput\u2014producing a dramatic inversion.",
        "Where Marconi\u2019s human operators had been appendages to a motionless machine, the device that I now grasped was a liberating extension of my mobile body.",
        "SCALE The two parts of Marconi\u2019s system had evolved in opposite directions.",
        "The network had scaled up.",
        "The single wireless link had exploded into a dense, global web of wireless infrastructure; if you counted all of its terrestrial, satellite, and spacecraft linkages, it was now humankind\u2019s most extensive single construction.",
        "Simultaneously, though, the transmission and reception apparatus had dramatically scaled down; it had reduced from landscape element to fashion accessory.",
        "And this two sided transformation, I reflected, was not just a technological wonder; it had changed the way we lived.",
        "Over the course of a hundred years\u2014and particularly in the last couple of decades\u2014the convergence of increasingly capable wireless technology with expanding network infrastructure, miniaturized electronics, and proliferating digital information had radically refashioned the relationships of individuals to their constructed environments and to one another.",
        "I thought of the cellphone conversations that had continued until the very moment the World Trade Center towers collapsed, of the desperate calls from the cabins of hijacked airliners hurtling toward their targets, and of the pagers that had carried on transmitting from beneath the rubble.3 We had become inseparable from our increasingly capable electronic organs; our very limbs had become fleshy antenna supports; our interconnections had ramified and intensified to an almost incomprehensible degree.",
        "From prenatal imaging and heartbeat monitoring to posthumous persistence of our digital addresses and traces, our bodies now existed in a state of continuous electronic engagement with their surroundings.",
        "Thing to thing relationships had similarly mutated.",
        "Digital networks had begun as collections of large, expensive boxes connected by cheap wires.",
        "But over time the boxes got smaller, cheaper, and more numerous, while the wires remained much the same.",
        "Increasingly, then, it was the wiring of networks, not the boxes, that consumed space and cost money.",
        "With the extension of networks, telecommunications providers worried about the \"last mile\u201d of cable to homes and businesses, architects struggled to jam cable trays and wiring closets into buildings, cables snaggled across floors in unseemly tangles, and many things that might benefit from network connections never got them because it was just too difficult to run the wires.",
        "By the dawn of the twenty first century, though, inexpensive, ubiquitous wireless connections were linking whole new classes of things into networks\u2014 very tiny things, very numerous things, very isolated things, highly mobile things, things deeply embedded in other things, and things that were jammed into tight and inaccessible places.",
        "Most dramatically, wireless transponders that could identify physical objects had shrunk to the size of a pinhead and the cost of a few cents, and billions of them were being produced and deployed.",
        "Now, nothing need be without processing power, and nothing need be left unlinked.",
        "The distinction between computer hardware and more traditional sorts of hardware was rapidly fading.",
        "MATERIALITY The trial separation of bits and atoms is now over.",

And, maybe, the ultimate network will operate by the quantum magical means of quantum entanglement and teleportation of quantum states from one site to another.18 So we have gone from local habitation and mechanical subdivision of time to a far more dynamic, electronically based, network mediated, global system of sequencing and coordination.",

        "The first roads were a primitive form of network infrastructure.",
        "Wheels were devices operating upon that infrastructure, and each was precisely adapted to the requirements of the other.",

        "At first, machine power could be transmitted only over short distances, by means of mechanical linkages such as the drive trains of automobiles and the belt systems of early mills, but the combination of electrical generators, transmission systems, and motors allowed cities to equip themselves with extensive, efficient power distribution networks.2 And as power grids have extended and linked with one another, power sources have increasingly distanced themselves from sites of consumption; Hoover Dam (near Las Vegas) exports most of its hydroelectric power output to southern California, and Hydro Quebec supplies much of eastern North America.",

        "Since then, the growth of cellular systems has been explosive; by 1990 there were about eleven million cellular users worldwide, by 1995 the number of new mobile phone subscribers each year was beginning to exceed the number of new fixed telephone subscribers, and by the early 2000s the number of users was heading into the billions.12 Early cellular systems employed analog signals and were intended primarily to handle voice communications.",
        "By the early 2000s, systems were going digital and increasingly shifting their emphasis from providing continuous, person to person voice connections to handling bursts of chip to chip data.",
        "This generated interest in broadband wireless systems that could deliver data not just at rates of kilobits per second, but at megabits, or even hundreds of megabits per second\u2014as required, for example, by sophisticated multimedia.13 Eventually, the differences between voice and data wireless systems began, messily and haltingly, to disappear.14 We entered a world of GSM and G3 cellphone service, IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b15 local area networks (the \"wireless Internet\u201d), Bluetooth16 networks to replace the serial and USB cables that had interconnected adjacent electronic devices, and high speed UWB17 networks.",

        "The goal of a wireless transmitter is to provide satisfactory reception to suitable devices (either fixed or mobile) within some target area.",
        "This is essentially a matter of transmission antenna type and placement, signal strength, signal frequency, receiver design, the need to make efficient use of available spectrum, the requirement for sufficient spatial or temporal separation of signals that occupy the same parts of the spectrum, and policy governing spectrum use.18 It turns out that there is a complex logic of wireless coverage, and that this logic has motivated the construction of wireless infrastructure \"shells\u201d encircling the earth at successively greater altitudes, like the layers of a rather messy and incomplete onion.",

        "The smallest, lowest powered, shortest range systems communicate over distances of centimeters or meters.",
        "There is little need to regulate their use of spectrum, since they are not likely to create interference with other systems.",
        "They obviously aren\u2019t useful for person to person voice communication (your unaided voice probably carries further), but they provide a convenient, flexible way to interconnect tiny computing devices without physical networking\u2014an idea that has been explored in the MIT Media Laboratory\u2019s \"pushpin\u201d and \"paintable\u201d computer projects.",
        "And they can be organized to provide multihop connections over longer distances\u2014much as packets are routed from node to node through the Internet.",
        "At a slightly larger scale, Bluetooth enabled devices (which contain special microchips) can interconnect wirelessly on desktops or within rooms\u2014over distances up to about ten meters.",
        "Bluetooth was originally developed in the mid 1990s to link laptop computers to mobile phones.",
        "But it also now serves to interconnect numerous other types of consumer devices, such as MP3 players, digital cameras, printers, and video projectors, and to link portable devices to stationary network access points.",
        "Most interestingly, a Bluetooth device can establish instant connection to any other Bluetooth device that comes within range\u2014thus enabling, for example, ad hoc networking among laptops in a conference room or classroom.",
        "Essentially, Bluetooth and similar systems provide freedom of movement and flexibility of spatial arrangement within room sized socio technical systems.",
        "Bluetooth is not the only wireless technology suitable for this role, and it is likely that better alternatives will supplant it, but it has at least served to introduce short range wireless connectivity.",
        "At the next scale up, Wi Fi (802.11) and similar wireless base stations typically have ranges of 100 meters or so, but their signals are easily blocked by walls and other obstructions.19 Thus they are well suited to providing mobile coverage within private homes, businesses, cafes, gardens and parks, and so on.",
        "As these systems are deployed, our built environment is being populated, increasingly densely, with wireless points of presence that link low powered, miniaturized, portable devices to high speed, long distance networks.",
        "Base stations and portable devices provide personal mobility, while wiring in the walls provides indefinitely expandable capacity.20 Since these base station systems provide coverage at room and building scale, they tend to strengthen interconnections within established occupant communities.",
        "If they are open to visitors, they also extend a new form of hospitality.",
        "By providing free Internet access, they can add a new dimension to public space; Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park was one of the first public places to offer this amenity.",
        "And since the technology is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and uses unlicensed spectrum (in most places, anyway), it encourages grassroots neighborhood networking.21 With more powerful base stations, it is also well suited for municipal efforts by small towns and villages, electronically updating the communal role of the central church bell tower or the minaret; in 2002 the small Georgia town of Ellaville (population 1,700) pioneered this strategy by installing a broadband base station on its water tower, together with rooftop antennas, to provide Internet connectivity within a kilometer radius.",
        "The New Zealand city of Auckland deployed a larger scale, demonstration network throughout its central business district.",
        "However, there is a price to pay for this electronic conviviality; since signals do not stop precisely at walls, there are also dangers of overlap and interference between coverage areas, of unauthorized appropriation of base station capacity by neighbors or passersby, and of electronic eavesdropping.",
        "Outdoors, at city block and urban neighborhood scales, cellular infrastructure, which makes use of licensed spectrum and centralized switching, typically begins to take over.",
        "The infrastructure (particularly for advanced digital service) is costly, so it is typically deployed and controlled by telecommunications companies rather than by grassroots groups.",
        "Each base station in the system comprises a transmitter, a receiver, and a control unit, and is located roughly at the center of a cell.",
        "Coverage areas consist of mosaics of such cells.",
        "Cells may be about ten kilometers across, but they will be subdivided into smaller cells (with correspondingly lower powered transmitters) in areas of high usage.",
        "The base stations for the smallest microcells are found on lamp posts and other street furniture, those for larger cells are often mounted on small buildings and special towers, while those for the largest cells move to the tops of hills and skyscrapers.",
        "Since suitable base station locations are in limited supply, and since there are often competing cellular systems, there tends to be increasingly intense contention for cellular infrastructure sites.",
        "Although the infrastructure of cellular grids has traditionally been deployed at fixed locations, mobile \"cells on wheels\u201d may be used for rapid disaster recovery (these were much in evidence in Lower Manhattan in the days following the World Trade Center attacks), and there has been growing interest in the possibility of ad hoc, towerless cellular networks that are carried by mobile handsets\u2014and thus automatically follow users around and adjust for density.",
        "Naturally enough, cellular providers have tended to concentrate their infrastructure in high density urban areas, and along highly traveled transportation routes, where the payoff is greatest.",
        "In the developing world, and in sparsely populated areas, this has produced a pattern of urban wireless \"islands\u201d connected by long distance links.",
        "Occasionally, as with GrameenPhone\u2019s GSM cellular system in Bangladesh, an explicit commitment to the welfare of the rural poor has generated more even coverage.22 The next scale of wireless infrastructure is that of high powered, tower based, licensed transmitters providing coverage over distances of tens, hundreds, or even thousands of kilometers.",
        "This type of infrastructure began to emerge very early, with the first wireless telegraph towers\u2014which were thought of, for a while, as \"electromagnetic lighthouses.\u201d These were followed by the towers of early mobile radio telephone systems, such as those used by taxis and police cars.",
        "And chains of microwave transmitter/receiver towers have sometimes been employed (particularly in difficult terrain) as an alternative to long distance telecommunication cables.",
        "Socially and politically, though, a more interesting use of high powered, tower based infrastructure is for radio and television broadcasting to urban, regional, national, and even global audiences.",
        "Where the industrial era combination of machine powered presses with rapid transportation had created urban mass audiences that were reachable within hours, this type of infrastructure provides synchronous access to such audiences at very low cost.",
        "Since electromagnetic spectrum is a finite resource, there can only be a limited number of broadcasters in a given geographic area without interference, so this type of infrastructure tends to hegemony\u2014concentrating political power and cultural influence in the hands of those who control the towers.23 Consequently, governments have generally sought either to retain direct control of the transmission towers themselves or to license control to a few broadcasters.24 In general, the taller the transmission tower you control, and the more powerful its signal, the wider your broadcast coverage; thus the prominent towers that rise proudly from the tops of the tallest skyscrapers in cities like New York are not only instruments of broadcast dominance, they are visible announcements of it.",
        "When a high powered system is used for two way communications within some group that is scattered across a wide geographic area, different speakers take turns occupying the limited number of available channels (often just a single channel).",
        "Shared, structured use of a common resource in this way provides cohesion to communities as diverse as those of the shortwave School of the Air in the Australian outback, truckers chatting on their CB radios, taxi drivers and patrolling police officers going about their business, and Afghan fighters exchanging taunts via their walkie talkies.",
        "The commonly available spectrum acts as a social focus, much like the well in a traditional village.",
        "When Sputnik began to transmit signals back to earth in 1957, the possibility emerged of extremely high altitude transmission points, with correspondingly large \"footprints.\u201d By 1960 NASA had launched Echo 1\u2014a Mylar balloon satellite that could reflect signals back to earth.",
        "(This was a variant on the older idea of bouncing signals off the moon.) In July 1962, Telstar, the first active communication satellite, went aloft and carried the first live, transatlantic television transmission.",
        "Passage of the Communications Satellite Act by the U.S.",
        "Congress quickly followed, and COMSAT (Communications Satellite Corporation) was formed.",
        "Not coincidentally, Marshall McLuhan\u2019s phrase \"the global village\u201d began to resonate with the popular imagination.",
        "In the succeeding decades, the skies were gradually blanketed with satellites.",
        "Not far beyond the Earth\u2019s ionosphere, in orbit at distances between 500 and 2,000 kilometers, there are now low earth orbit (LEO) telecommunication satellite systems.",
        "Satellites in a LEO system contain transponders that receive uplinks from transmitters on the ground, converting them into downlinks to receivers on the ground or handing them off to other satellites.",
        "(A transponder is a device that receives a signal and transmits some sort of signal back.) The Iridium and Globalstar LEO systems were first put in place with great fanfare (maybe a bit prematurely) in the 1990s to extend the idea of a cellular network to the skies and to provide wireless voice and data systems with global coverage.",
        "So called Little LEO systems, such as Orbcomm, are designed for paging, tracking, and similar applications of small bursts of data.",
        "Big LEO systems, such as Globalstar, work at higher frequencies, support higher data rates, and can support voice and positioning services.",
        "In order to provide service at desired locations on the earth\u2019s surface, LEO systems must extend coverage to the entire earth\u2019s surface.",
        "Thus they are particularly important to isolated and sparsely populated areas that are not readily served by other types of infrastructure.",
        "Furthermore, there is likely to be considerable excess capacity in these areas\u2014capacity that might, at least in principle, be devoted to education and to supporting economic development.",
        "Further out, orbiting at 5,000 to 12,000 kilometers, are medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite systems, such as ICO.",
        "These operate much like LEO systems, but find a different balance of technical tradeoffs.",
        "They require fewer handoffs but higher powered signals, and they introduce longer delays due to the greater distances involved.",
        "Furthest out, at about 35,000 kilometers, are the geostationary telecommunications satellites.",
        "Unlike LEO and MEO satellites, they are stationary relative to the earth\u2014much like very tall transmission towers.",
        "They provide footprints covering very large areas of the earth\u2019s surface, which is very effective for television broadcasting but wasteful of spectrum (and therefore expensive) for point to point communications.",
        "They also introduce delays that are very noticeable in synchronous voice and video communication.",
        "Proposed by Arthur C.",
        "Clarke in 1945, the first of them (Intelsat 1) was launched in April 1965, and they have proliferated enormously since.",
        "They now cluster densely over the more populated parts of the earth, providing services such as voice communication, digital video (for example, via the DBS system), and Internet access through services such as DirectPC and Starband.",
        "Obviously there is competition among the various different types of satellite systems, and between satellite systems and terrestrial wireless systems.25 When a GEO satellite is in position, it provides instant coverage over a very wide area, with significant performance and capacity limitations.",
        "LEO satellite systems have very high initial costs, and take more time to deploy, but promise technical advantages.",
        "Terrestrial systems are relatively inexpensive and can be extended incrementally; if this happens rapidly while new satellite systems are being planned and deployed (as the planners of Iridium discovered, to their cost), much of the potential market for satellite service is lost.",
        "In the long run, satellite systems seem likely to occupy some important niches in wireless service (such as GPS, global paging, and service to sparsely populated rural areas), but not to provide a universal solution.",
        "From centimeter range micro wirelesses to broad coverage geostationary satellites, the wireless world is weaving around itself an increasingly dense, multilayered cocoon of antennas, network access points, relay points, and channels.",
        "Different types of physical channels are increasingly being integrated, through telecommunication standards and protocols, into vast, seamless systems of bewildering complexity.",
        "Every point on the surface of the earth is now part of the Hertzian landscape\u2014the product of innumerable transmissions and of the reflections and obstructions of those transmissions.",
        "The electromagnetic terrain that we have constructed, and continue to elaborate, consists of hotspots and deadspots, exposed areas and shielded areas, cells that get you through and overloaded cells that don\u2019t, signals (encoded in many different ways) that interfere with one another and signals that are cleverly multiplexed so that they don\u2019t interfere, jammed zones and Faraday cages, and the endless buzzes and bursts of electromagnetic noise.26 It is an intricate, invisible landscape\u2014 one that is hinted at by the presence of antennas (sometimes, as well, by symbols warchalked in the street to indicate hotspots),27 and can be made manifest by wardriving or warstrolling with a wireless laptop.",
        "This landscape frames a complex geopolitics and political economy of wireless coverage.",
        "Within it, at every scale, there is competition for access to communities, for antenna sites, for timeslots, and for channel capacity.28 Just as the kingdoms and empires of old struggled for control of terrestrial territory, those who seek power today increasingly contend for control of the airwaves.",
        "One geopolitical strategy, with its roots in earlier traditions of telephone and broadcast communications, is to treat spectrum like frontier land.",
        "Governments chop it up and sell it\u2014as in the spectrum auctions in many parts of the world that preceded introduction of G3 cellphone service.",
        "This facilitates comprehensive, top down planning.",
        "However, it concentrates responsibility for providing coverage in the hands of a few license holders, and it encourages the development of centralized networks in which everything must flow through a few major switching centers, which become increasingly overloaded as the numbers of users grow.",
        "And it often slows down the extension of service, since spectrum auctions saddle license holders with huge debts.",
        "A competing strategy, which draws upon the lessons of the Internet, is to think of spectrum as a communal resource, like the old village commons, or the land available to a squatter community.",
        "Anyone can use it, as long as they follow a few rules.",
        "This depends upon availability of unlicensed spectrum, and use of short range, maybe multihop wireless technologies.",
        "It is messier, makes provision of adequate security harder, and risks overexploitation by a few at the expense of the many, but it has some important attractions.",
        "It allows the decentralized, bottom up construction and interconnection of networks\u2014much as packet switching and TCP/IP enabled the explosive, bottom up formation of a global wired network.",
        "And it encourages a redundantly linked, decentralized network structure\u2014which means that the addition of channels can enhance capacity without overloading central nodes.",
        "There is, however, an additional twist.",
        "Since wireless spectrum is an immaterial, electronically managed resource, it can potentially (unlike land) be reallocated swiftly and automatically to meet changing demands.",
        "This opens up the possibility of dense wireless networks in which nodes cooperate dynamically to use available spectrum with maximum efficiency.29 It seems likely that this will be the key to future expansion of wireless networks in densely populated areas.",
        "At the extreme, deployment of wireless infrastructure can become a runaway, viral process.",
        "With very inexpensive wireless nodes, and a common standard such as 802.11, individuals can add nodes at will.",
        "With multihop technology, mobile and ad hoc wireless nodes can spontaneously form chains back to fixed infrastructure.",
        "And positive network externalities, supported by appropriate network architectures, can vigorously drive the expansion process; every node added to a network increases the value of existing nodes.",
        "There is a close parallel, in all this, with strategies for real estate development.",
        "Governments can allocate land in a few large chunks for master planned communities, or they can establish some general rules for land subdivision and development and encourage numerous smaller, independently initiated and controlled projects.",
        "Most often, in practice, urban form emerges from a complex combination of the two\u2014and that is likely to be the future of the Hertzian landscape as well.",
        "ELECTRONIC NOMADICITY Gradually emerging from the messy but irresistible extension of wireless coverage is the possibility of a radically reimagined, reconstructed, electronic form of nomadicity\u2014a form that is grounded not just in the terrain that nature gives us, but in sophisticated, well integrated wireless infrastructure, combined with other networks, and deployed on a global scale.",
        "Leonard Kleinrock (one of the pioneers of the Internet) has defined this infrastructure as \"the system support needed to provide a rich set of computing and communication capabilities and services to nomads as they move from place to place in a way that is transparent, integrated, convenient, and adaptive.\u201d30 This requires, as Kleinrock notes, \"independence of location, motion, computing platform, communication device, and communication bandwidth, along with general availability of access to remote files, systems, and services.\u201d The technical challenges of achieving this are significant, but they will gradually be worked out, and as they do, the social and cultural implications of electronic nomadicity will become increasingly evident.31 Other types of networks\u2014transportation, energy supply, water supply and waste disposal\u2014cannot operate wirelessly (or pipelessly), of course.",
        "But by providing efficient summoning and locating capabilities, wireless connectivity links our mobile bodies much more effectively to these more traditional resource systems.",
        "If you want transportation, for example, you can call a taxi or ambulance with your cellphone.",
        "If you want to know when the next bus is coming, you can look at a bus stop display that wirelessly tracks the vehicles in the system.",
        "If you want to find a nearby vacant parking space, a drinking fountain, or a public toilet that\u2019s open and salubrious, you will increasingly be able to do so with your portable wireless devices.",

        "Furthermore, wireless interconnectivity mobilizes things as well as people.",
        "In wired networks, things such as desktop telephones and computers need to be physically plugged in to operate; they have relatively fixed and stable locations.",
        "But in wirelessly interconnected systems, components just need to be within range.",
        "If you add miniaturization and self configuration capability (just stick a component anywhere, and it works) to wireless interconnectivity, networked systems become fluid and amorphous.32 They are less like rigid things on boards or in boxes, less like buildings or cities, and more like the camps of nomads\u2014ready to move around and reconfigure, at a moment\u2019s notice, as required.",
        "The cumulative effect of these transformations is profound, and will become more so as wireless technology continues to develop and proliferate.33 Wireless connections of fixed infrastructure to wearable and portable electronic devices, and among miniaturized wireless devices, are now completing the long project of seamlessly integrating our mobile biological bodies with globally extended systems of nodes and linkages.",
        "As a result, functions that were once served by architecture, furniture, and fixed equipment are now shifting to implanted, wearable, and portable devices.",
        "And activities that once depended upon close proximity to sites of accumulation\u2014of water, food, raw materials, bank vaults, library books, or files of business information\u2014now rely increasingly upon mobile connectivity to geographically extended delivery networks.",

        "I am inscribed not within a single Vitruvian circle, but within radiating electromagnetic wavefronts.",
        "ACCESS RULES This new form of nomadicity is, of course, very different from that of ancient hunter gatherer bands, which were forced by the sparse distribution of food, water, and other resources to range over wide areas.",

        "They were limited by what they could carry around with them.",
        "The very possibility of further economic, social, and cultural development depended upon sedentarization, the accumulation and protection of food surpluses, the consequent ability to support nonfood producing specialists at sites of accumulation, and increasingly specialized division of labor within densely populated cities.34 Today, large scale networks support division of labor and specialization on a global rather than a merely urban scale, the possibility of non food producing specialization depends upon network access, and that access is\u2014increasingly\u2014available ubiquitously and continuously.",
        "You can get whatever advantages you may seek from mobility\u2014wider intellectual and cultural horizons, global business opportunities, access to unique talents and resources, collaboration among geographically distributed specialists, the stimulus of diversity\u2014with far fewer of the traditional costs.",
        "Under these post sedentary conditions, access capabilities and privileges are more important than traditional forms of ownership and control of property.35 If you are sufficiently wealthy and privileged, for example, you can now travel very lightly\u2014with credit card and passport, some portable electronic equipment, and a carry on bag; you can take full advantage of the world\u2019s highly developed network infrastructure to access whatever you want, wherever you may need it.",
        "If you are a knowledge worker, a personal library of books accumulated in your study may now be less useful than mobile network access and acquisition of intellectual property rights to online information.",

        "With further miniaturization, RFID devices shrink to tags that are tiny enough to carry on key chains, to be sewn into clothing, or even to be implanted under the skin; wireless nomads can become continuously, automatically self identifying.36 You don\u2019t even have to stop to identify yourself; electronic devices can suck the RFID bits from your body or your vehicle as you pass by.",
        "From the viewpoint of service consumers, ubiquitous access capabilities and privileges assure you of getting what you want when and where you want it.",

        "In other words, the post sedentary world represents the ultimate abstraction and mobilization of exchange capability\u2014and therefore, of wealth and power.37 In simple barter economies, wealth does you little good unless you have your accumulated goods nearby and can physically hand them over in exchange for other things you may want.",

        "These vessels were valuable, so the women stood in line with them, for hours, at the spring.",

        "Kapuscinski comments: \"What a relief this is for the exhausted African woman!...",
        "How much more time she now has for herself, for her household!\u201d1 Ironically, the affluent now also get their water in lightweight plastic containers\u2014with labels like Evian.",
        "In this case, lightening the container helps the distributor to bypass local water supply systems and to deliver a branded product from a great distance.",
        "From the consumer\u2019s viewpoint, lightness has a different value; it provides the product with portability, therefore adding to its appeal to travelers and recreationists.",

        "Tiny, dense arrays allowed optical systems to shrink and completely eliminated the film transport mechanism.",
        "More subtly, substitution of electronic circuits for optical and mechanical means (particularly in the viewfinder system) changed the required connections and spatial relationships among camera parts and allowed them to be repackaged in denser and more compact ways.",

        "As the technology has advanced, the minimum dimensions of elements in these structures have shrunk from tens of micrometers to tens of nanometers.",
        "This progression will reach its limit when elements get down to a couple of nanometers\u2014the size of an atom\u2014but this is not the end of the technological line for microfabrication.3 As the race to this limit nears its end, emphasis is shifting to invention of new types of microscale structures and systems.",
        "Already, microfabrication techniques have been extended and generalized from electronic circuits to microfluidic systems with tiny channels, reservoirs, valves, and nozzles to replace the glass tubes and beakers of traditional chemistry laboratories, and thus allow analysis of much smaller samples.",
        "They have also been employed to produce waveguides for optical and radio signals.",
        "The name for such structures, microelectromechanical systems, is bigger than they are\u2014so it has mercifully been shortened to MEMS.4 More surprisingly, MEMS can have moving parts such as switches and valves, vibrating cantilevers, and tiny gears and mechanical linkages.",

        "They can, for example, serve as pressure sensors, microphones, accelerometers, and angular rate sensors.",

        "Even smaller versions snuggled into pockets and handbags, like cigar cases, hip flasks, and makeup compacts.",
        "Next, as components became tinier, and as designers realized that parts could be interconnected flexibly rather than packed into rigid plastic or metal boxes, computers became conformable to the contours of the body.",
        "They had evolved from heavy machinery into close fitting wearables; you could begin to imagine wiggling into them like gloves, folding them into pockets like handkerchiefs, or sporting them like neckties.",
        "Ultimately, you might think of them as smart, barely visible particles.",
        "Once, designers separated their domains by scales and associated functional categories; circuit designers and nanotechnologists operated in the nanometer to millimeter range, product designers went from millimeters to meters, architects typically dealt with details at millimeter scale and overall building dimensions of tens or hundreds of meters, while urban designers and civil engineers might work on infrastructure and land use systems extending over many kilometers.",
        "Today, such scale chauvinism makes little sense.",
        "The solution to a given design problem might be found at any scale or combination of scales\u2014 and an increasing amount of functionality that once resided in large, immobile structures and machines is now squeezed into portable, wearable, and even molecular devices.",
        "It makes even less sense to draw sharp distinctions between nonliving and living systems.",
        "As biology, materials science, mechanical engineering, and electronics all get down to the molecular scale, they deal with the same types and sizes of structures, and there is a growing crossover of interests and goals.",
        "As biologists engage ideas of modular recombination, splicing, and cloning, they begin to think like designers.",

        "MULTIFUNCTIONALITY Growing reliance upon small scale systems\u2014particularly miniaturized, portable electronics\u2014has also produced rampant hybridization of devices.",
        "Not so long ago, for example, telephones were desktop or pocket devices for audio communication, cameras were optical/ mechanical/chemical devices for picture taking, and GPS navigation systems were bulky items of equipment for boats and airplanes.",
        "By about 2002, though, all of these devices could be squeezed into the same portable, electronic box\u2014and their combination opened up a surprisingly useful new possibility; you could take a picture and instantly transmit it, along with a map of the place where the picture was taken.20 Servers could begin to accumulate image databases\u2014with automatic indexing by time and date, location, and author\u2014from multiple, mobile, remote sources.",
        "Similarly, cellphones and PDAs, which had arrived upon the scene as separate boxes, began to fuse into one.21 This convergence was prompted, in part, by the competition for pocket and handbag space; why carry around two boxes when you can get what you need from one? And it was also motivated by the search for economies; why double up on power supplies, processors, display screens, and keyboards? But its most important consequence was the convenient integration of functions that had hitherto been separate; why keep your address book and your dial up device in separate, disconnected boxes? There is, however, a crucial space time tradeoff to consider.",
        "When a device such as a Swiss Army knife or a PDA provides access to many different functions, you can only make use of one of these functions at a time, and you have to switch from mode to mode\u2014 from the knife blade to the corkscrew, for example, or from the address book to the calendar.",
        "Conversely, a spatial array of single purpose knives, corkscrews, and so on takes up more space, but there is no time wasting and potentially confusing mode switching, and you can store each special device in its context of use\u2014the corkscrew near the wine rack, and so on.",
        "Where space is scarce and there is little or no fixed infrastructure to rely upon, as in a hiker\u2019s backpack, multifunctionality and form factor minimization tend to win.",
        "Where space is fairly tight, as in a tiny city apartment, multimodal devices such as sofa beds may still make sense.",
        "But where there is plenty of room and a lot of fixed infrastructure, as in a large suburban house, it is far more convenient to provide special purpose devices in their contexts of use\u2014beds in bedrooms, sofas in living rooms, corkscrews at bars, and knives in kitchens.",
        "It makes a difference if you can switch modes easily; unfolding a sofa bed for sleeping is aggravating and time consuming, but picking a function from a menu on a PDA is not so bad.",
        "Context sensitivity, if it can be reliably achieved, is even better; a really smart portable device might know where you are and what you need to do there, and adjust its current mode accordingly.",
        "Miniaturized, mobile devices sometimes allow us to save time by performing tasks while we are in motion.",
        "Most of us, for example, have no difficulty listening to the radio while jogging or driving.",
        "But our capacity to pay attention is limited, so driving while talking on a cellphone is riskier.",
        "When you need to use keyboards and view video screens, it is wise to stop, sit down, and give them your undivided attention.",
        "As broadband wireless connections deliver fatter streams of bits to the mobile body, attention management will become an increasingly crucial design issue.",
        "The mechanisms may be very simple, as when voicemail or TiVo allow you to defer attention to data streams until you are ready.",
        "Or they might depend upon sophisticated context sensitivity\u2014enabling a cellphone or automobile navigation system to interrupt you only when it is safe to do so, but to be bolder when the message is really urgent.",
        "As devices become smaller, as software takes over more functions from hardware, and as space time tradeoffs are critically reevaluated, traditional functional categories may no longer hold.",
        "Electronic devices may readily be assembled into unprecedented combinations that provide hitherto unavailable functional mixes.",
        "These assemblies may be stuffed into compact packages, or they may be constructed through dispersed network connections.",
        "Through wireless interconnections, these functions may be divided, in whatever ways turn out to be most convenient, between smaller, wearable devices and larger elements of immobile infrastructure.",
        "And, by virtue of their embedded electronics, objects that have long performed traditional functions\u2014 from items of clothing to sheets of wallboard\u2014will acquire increasingly important ancillary functions.",
        "Where efficiency matters, as in the layout of a chip, form follows function in rigorous fashion; sophisticated optimization techniques are used to minimize the distances that electrons must move through surfaces, to pack components as densely as possible onto scarce chip real estate, and to assure that heat is effectively dispersed.",
        "Conversely, at scales and speeds where the lengths of the wired or wireless linkages among standard electronic components have trivial effect upon performance, designers have enormous freedom to shape electronic assemblies into arbitrary sculptural forms, to mold them to the contours of the body, to conceal them within other objects, and so on.",
        "During the 1980s, the Department of Industrial Design at London\u2019s Royal College of Art championed this freedom, and many innovative designs for electronic products emerged\u2014most notably, perhaps, Daniel Weil\u2019s designs for transistor radios.",
        "More recently, designers of electronic toys have exploited it in increasingly imaginative ways\u2014dolls converse electronically, toy vehicles acquire sophisticated electronic functionality, electronic dogs and other pets learn from their environments and respond to care; Lego puts electronics into modular building blocks, and Tod Machover\u2019s Toy Symphony blurs the line between electronic play and performance.",
        "BACK TO THE BODY All this has intensified interest in the scarce real estate of skin surface and its immediate surroundings.",
        "When timepieces resided in clock towers, they competed for central urban sites, but when they shrank to watches, they began to compete for wrist space\u2014scarcer (at least by convention) on female wrists than on male ones.",
        "When Marconi set out to build his Atlantic radio telegraph station, he first had to find an industrial scale chunk of real estate on Cape Cod, but when we decide to carry cellphones, we have to find space in our limited pocket, belt, or handbag real estate.",
        "Topography established the context for Marconi\u2019s design; anatomy does so for a cellphone design.",
        "Where architects have traditionally responded to human needs by allocating square footage for mechanical and electrical systems, furniture, and equipment within the rigid, large scale fabric of buildings, cyborg couturiers are now doing so by locating miniaturized devices within the smaller scale, more flexible fabric that clothes us.22 The microterrain immediately surrounding our bodies is providing habitats (mostly with very limited carrying capacities) for new, electronic species, which may be classified according to their sizes and shapes (known in the trade as their form factors), their modes of attachment to the body, their degrees of conformability to the body, and their degrees of visibility.",
        "You can think of these species as electronic parasites that both depend upon their hosts and provide benefits to them.",
        "And these parasites are evolving rapidly as they compete for the available niches within this up close and personal terrain.",
        "Traditionally, these niches and species have been explored most rigorously by designers of gear for foot soldiers\u2014who need to be as effectively equipped as possible, but who cannot be expected to lug too much weight.",

        "Not surprisingly, then, the U.S.",
        "Army has been quick to establish an Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology, focusing on \"threat detection, threat neutralization (such as bullet proof clothing), concealment, enhanced human performance, real time automated medical treatment, and reduced logistical footprint.\u201d23 According to the director: \"This will be achieved by creating, then scaling up to commercial level, revolutionary materials and devices composed of particles or components so tiny that hundreds could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.\u201d Reversing their usual tendency, weapons systems planners are beginning to think small.",
        "ELECTRONIC PARASITE NICHES Some emerging, miniature electronic species find their niches\u2014at least initially\u2014in the strap on, backpack systems such as the packs of hikers and foot soldiers, and the wearable equipment of scuba divers.",
        "These systems typically consist of fairly large, rigid elements linked by flexible fabric, leather, or hinges so that they can conform reasonably closely to the contours of the back.",
        "The more loosely strapped, shoulder hung variants can accommodate smaller objects, such as cameras.",
        "This part of the terrain has a lot of carrying capacity, but it produces cumbersome, clumsy appendages (which are particularly irksome indoors and in confined spaces), so it is best avoided whenever greater miniaturization provides the opportunity.",
        "The possibility of gripping large objects of arbitrary shape in the hand provides another attractive parasite niche.",
        "Historically, it has been occupied by the luggage of travelers, by large weapons\u2014from spears to shotguns\u2014or by specialized mechanical devices like portable typewriters.",
        "Generally you can only carry one or two things, so competition for this niche is intense.",
        "In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the winner was often the gentleman\u2019s walking cane, which therefore acquired an astonishing range of specialized secondary func tions\u2014weapon cane, tippling cane, pooper scooper cane, forked cane for trapping snakes, bicycle pump cane, seat cane, gun rest cane, cigarette case cane, gas lighter cane, watch cane, spyglass cane, zither cane, flashlight cane, cologne cane, and many more.24 Today the victor in this niche is commonly a laptop computer with a handle or carrying case\u2014a device of high functionality that cannot easily move into smaller scale habitats because of the need for large screens and convenient keyboards.",
        "Like the cane, it can accommodate numerous secondary functions\u2014now provided by plug in peripheral devices, such as DVD drives for playing movies.",
        "The principle is the same, though the form factor (driven by the primary function) is different.",
        "But the laptop\u2019s victory is a tenuous one; handheld objects are always in danger of being put down for something else.",
        "The traditions of clothing design have established an important niche for electronic parasites that can be slipped into pockets or hung in pouches and holsters on belts.",
        "Since bulging pockets are uncomfortable, and tend not to be regarded as a fashion plus, this niche imposes severe restrictions on the length, width, and thickness of objects.",
        "And, since pockets are flexible containers that may be subject to stresses as the body moves, it is an advantage for objects compet ing for pocket space to be flexible, conformable, and resilient.",
        "So far, the most successful electronic invaders of pocket space have been cellphones, PDAs, and electronic cards of various kinds.",
        "Devices that can squeeze into this niche can become almost as inseparable from us as our underwear.",
        "As miniaturization reduces more electronic devices to pocket size, and as new polymer based technologies enable flexible batteries and circuits, the competition for pocket space is likely to intensify.",
        "Still smaller electronic parasites may be sewn to clothing like buttons, pinned on like badges, strapped on like watches, or directly attached (with or without body piercing) like finger rings, navel jewelry, and ear studs.",
        "Cameos and lockets may run video loops instead of displaying static images, and sparkle may be provided electronically rather than by the cut of a gem.",
        "At this scale, conformability and flexibility matter less; jewel like devices can, without producing discomfort or inconvenience, be rigid and quite freely shaped.",
        "Furthermore, systems of rigid, jewel sized elements can be connected flexibly (like strings of beads) to make much larger, conformable constructions.",
        "Let\u2019s not forget teeth.",

        "And finally, of course, electronic parasites are increasingly capable of getting under your skin.",
        "Although they have been framed culturally in very different ways, the practices of body piercing and subdermal implantation are not far apart technologically.",
        "You can, for example, have a rice grain sized RFID chip injected by syringe to provide purchasing power and location tracking capability.25 Deeper within the body, we will increasingly find cochlear implants, internal defibrillators, and miniature devices incorporating sensors and transponders capable of measuring blood pressure and other conditions transmitting data wirelessly to external receivers.",
        "These devices are more permanently attached than external wearables, and you do not have to remove them to take a shower.",
        "Some of these proliferating parasites can attach themselves wherever there is room, but others require particular anatomical contexts.",
        "Thus there are growing, highly specialized genres of miniaturized eyepieces, earpieces, mouthpieces, and even nosepieces\u2014all of which may, on occasion, be integrated into specialized masks or helmets.",

        "SMART THREADS Since the accommodation available at any point in intradermal and near extradermal terrain is limited, and since there are efficiencies to be gained by centralizing rather than duplicating common functions, there is a growing need for network linkages among the electronic devices distributed around and within the body.",
        "It may make practical sense, for example, to centralize power supply instead of equipping each device with its own batteries or generators.",
        "Or there may be multiple, parasitic power generators\u2014sucking in kinetic, thermal, light, and radio frequency energy at various bodily locations\u2014to create a miniature power supply grid.",
        "This, then, introduces the need to drape the body with power cords, or\u2014perhaps more elegantly\u2014to weave power distribution circuitry (maybe composed of conductive polymers) into clothing.",
        "For data networking there are more options.",
        "The links may be wired, as with the connections between pocket telephones or music players and earphones\u2014the wires loosely draped or running elegantly through seams or zippers.",
        "Or links may be wireless, allowing anatomical logic rather than contiguity requirements to dictate disposition of functional elements around the body\u2014relatively bulky power supplies and processors in pockets, audio output in the ears, video displays in handhelds, on wrists, or integrated with spectacles, sensors wherever they are needed, and so on.",
        "They may even be run (harmlessly) through the body itself.",
        "Being smartly turned out will take on a whole new meaning as clothing fibers and fabrics acquire more active functionality and become increasingly programmable.27 They might, for example, expand to keep you warmer in cold weather, open up to provide more ventilation in hot weather, tighten and decrease porosity to become waterproof, change color on command, and stiffen to provide protection in the event of accident or attack.",
        "By incorporating microcapsules of phase change material, fabrics might absorb energy to cool you down when you\u2019re sweaty and expel heat to warm you when you\u2019re chilly.",

        "What might you now put in your pockets, wear on your belt, or carry in a backpack? What sorts of functions can you fit into jewelry, and how should jewelry express these? How might underwear and implants work together? What can be fitted, and what must hang more loosely? How much useful electronics can you jam into your shoes or your hat? What should be implanted semipermanently, what should go into inner garments, and what is best accommodated in easily shed outer layers? How can electronic earpieces, eyepieces, and mouthpieces be assimilated to traditions of facial adornment? Can you make use of rings or gloves to sense finger gestures\u2014maybe replacing keyboards? How should wearable devices respond to bodily movement, changes in surrounding conditions, and emergencies? Might programmable, animated tattoos and makeup serve your display needs? What has to be waterproof? Where should we run the bodynets, and what should we run through them?

        "Today, through email, instant messaging, and the Web, text mostly comes to you in completely dematerialized form.",
        "You can see the effects of all this in the varying forms that libraries have taken, and the social and intellectual roles that they have played.",
        "Before texts were mobilized, large concentrations of manuscripts functioned as powerful magnets for scholars and centers of scholarly communities.2 The great Library of Alexandria, for example, attracted scholars from all over the Hellenistic world.",
        "The more extensive and renowned its collection of hundreds of thousands of scrolls became, the more scholars needed to be there.",
        "The surrounding community became increasingly rich in intellectual talent, and the daily interactions among members of that community multiplied the benefit\u2014often yielding new manuscripts that ended up back in the library.",
        "This was, of course, the beginning of the modern idea of the university.",
        "Millennia later, the mechanism was still working just fine; when the more scholarly protagonists of Ulysses got together after lunch in the National Library at the Heart of the Hibernian Metropolis, the books brought them there and the intellectual interchange followed.",
        "Well into the age of print, it remained slow, expensive, and difficult to build large book collections, so locations fortunate enough to have them sustained a comparative advantage.",
        "The buildings that housed them and celebrated their importance were often conceived as central landmarks\u2014the library at the very heart of Venice, the great rotunda and dome at the focus of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s University of Virginia, the proud book towers at Cambridge and Yale.",
        "Within these landmarks, card catalogues near the entrances provided compact, central representations of the collections that could be surfed for guidance before venturing into the vast book stacks beyond.",
        "But as books became cheaper and more numerous, and distribution systems improved, this traditional comparative advantage began to erode.",
        "Even small, isolated communities could now have respectable local libraries; these could not compare to the great central collections, but they sufficed to launch many a scholarly career.",
        "Local schools, colleges, and universities could develop their own collections.",
        "And individuals could stock their private bookshelves.",
        "The system for providing access to accumulated texts devolved into an increasingly multinodal, decentralized network of local storage and redistribution points.",
        "As accumulations grew within this system, so did pressure on storage and transportation systems.3 One response was to improve the engineering of bookshelves and bookstacks.",
        "Another was to make books smaller and lighter; the pocket book and the paperback emerged.",
        "Yet another was to compress more radically by transferring text from paper to microfilm.4 By the mid twentieth century, Vannevar Bush could see where this drive toward miniaturization and dematerialization was leading.",
        "In his remarkable vision of the \u201cMemex,\u201d he imagined individual microfilm libraries, stored within desk sized storage and access devices, which would provide individual scholars with inexpensive, immediate, local access to the resources of major col lections.5 And implicitly, he raised questions that were to reverberate, with ever increasing urgency, in the coming decades.",
        "To what extent should we treat bound books as valuable objects in themselves, justifying the allocation of space, time, and money for their preservation? And to what extent should we just strip out their information content, transfer it to more compact and mobile media, and toss away the carcasses? It turned out that microfilm was not really up to the task, but the CD ROM and the personal computer were.",
        "In 1972, on the Irvine campus of the University of California, the Library of Alexandria was reborn in digital form.",
        "The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae ( TLG ) project began, with the ambitious goal of producing a database containing all ancient Greek literature.6 By 2001, the database contained virtually everything surviving from the period between Homer (eighth century b.c.e.) and 600 c.e., plus numerous additional texts from the Byzantine and post Byzantine periods.",
        "David Packard\u2019s Ibycus system, and other software, provided sophisticated search and retrieval capabilities.",
        "It added up to more than 80 million words, and it was all available to scholars on CD\u2014an astonishing feat of comprehensive accumulation, compression, and distribution that has transformed the daily practices of classical scholarship throughout the world.",
        "The TLG, in its initial form, was highly miniaturized but still not completely dematerialized; the plastic disk of the CD remained and required physical transportation to sites of use.",
        "But packet switching, the Internet, and eventually the World Wide Web, allowed the remaining atoms to be scraped off.7 Today, if you have a PC, a network connection, and a license, you can get the TLG online.",

        "Finally, Alexandria comes to you.",
        "Encyclopedias have, with astonishing rapidity, followed a parallel developmental trajectory.",
        "Until the PC came along, the Encyclopedia Britannica was a bulky, heavy, expensive set of printed volumes.",
        "Then the Encarta encyclopedia shrunk itself onto a CD.",
        "Now the Britannica has dumped those high priced atoms (for which there is no longer a market) and has gone online\u2014supporting itself through advertising and ancillary service revenues.",
        "And in specialized professional fields, subscription supported online databases, such as LexisNexis for lawyers and MEDLINE for medical practitioners and researchers, have made successful businesses out of providing comprehensive access to published articles and papers.",
        "Similarly, the Los Alamos e print arXivhas successfully shucked the atoms from physics and mathematics papers\u2014making them instantly available, via the Web, almost anywhere.8 Initiated in 1991 by Paul Ginsparg, it quickly became indispensable to physics researchers throughout the world.",
        "Ten years later it was attracting more than 30,000 electronic paper submissions each year.",
        "Many researchers had formed the habit of consulting it each morning for the latest postings in their areas of research.",
        "It had dramatically quickened the rhythms of communication and collaboration within the international physics and mathematics communities and had gone a long way toward accomplishing its founder\u2019s goal of providing \"a level playing field for researchers at different academic levels and different geographic locations.\u201d9 You no longer had to be at an established, recognized center like MIT or Princeton to be an active, effective intellectual participant.",

        "Two more recent online scholarly communities, CogNet(for cognitive scientists)10 and ArchNet (for architects throughout the developing world),11 have gone even further.",
        "As with arXiv, large online archives are their central attractions.",
        "But, like ancient Alexandria, they also provide housing and public spaces for the scholars they attract\u2014 not in bricks and mortar form, of course, but in the forms of online private workspaces, member profiles, forums, news pages, calendars, job listings, and collaborative workspaces.",
        "And as such augmented archives have grown in importance, they have increasingly been viewed as crucial, long term community resources.12 By the year 2000, the writing was on the virtual wall.",
        "A National Academies report on the Library of Congress bluntly asserted that digital information was \"at the center of contemporary discourse.\u201d It continued: \"That role is a simple fact, unrelated to whatever e zealots or bibliophiles might wish to be the case.\u201d13 As evidence, they could point out that popular Web search engines like Google were, by that point, indexing more than a billion online pages.14 Most of what you needed was just one search away, and most of the rest was at two or three degrees of separation.",
        "And with a wireless laptop, you could potentially download any of it anywhere.",
        "FOOTLOOSE CODE Speech acts (that is, commands, promises, requests, and other utterances with consequences) have also operated in new ways as text has dematerialized and mobilized.",
        "Before mobile, written text, speech acts were local verbal events; you might yell a battlefield command or execute an agreement with a word and a handshake, and these sorts of face to face acts still carry a great deal of social and legal force.",
        "With paper came written instructions from remote commanders, contracts in the mail for signature, formal requests and demands, and the distinction between barristers and solicitors.",

        "In the 1960s punch cards were a standard storage and input medium for computer software; a program and its data might consist of several thousand pieces of perforated cardboard.",
        "Their information density was extraordinarily low\u2014much less that that of a printed page.",
        "They were handled by means of large, noisy, unreliable mechanical devices: keypunches, sorters, and readers.",

        "When you threw them out (as you did frequently) you generated a significant quantity of trash.",
        "If you were a programmer, you probably spent a lot of time in the keypunch room of a computer center, when you were not walking back and forth to the job submission window with boxes and printouts under your arm.",
        "As magnetic media became cheaper and denser, they gradually took over the role of program and data storage.",
        "Reel to reel tapes, tape cartridges of various kinds, and floppy disks gradually made code lighter, less bulky, and more portable.",
        "When the personal computer arrived in the 1980s, PC software was distributed in shrinkwrapped boxes, and sneakernet (walking with a floppy in your hand) served for transfer among machines.",
        "Some early personal computers had no hard drives and only became useful when you stuck in a disk.",
        "Then inexpensive, capacious hard disks, combined with increasingly efficient networking, precipitated a move to online software distribution.",
        "Instead of purchasing software from a retail store and lugging it home in a cardboard box, you could now simply download it over the Internet.",
        "(This proved particularly convenient for software updates.) The need for floppy disks and CDs greatly diminished, and readers for removable media were no longer essential components of desktop and laptop computers.",
        "Responding to its new environment, code itself evolved.",
        "Early programming languages, such as Fortran, had been designed with punch cards explicitly in mind; cards had eighty columns, so Fortran code used lengthy sequences of statements comprising eighty or fewer characters.",
        "But network era languages, such as C+ +, provided much greater formatting flexibility and allowed programmers to organize code into modular, reusable units known as objects.",
        "Then Java fully mobilized code by making it easy to download and execute such units on any networked device\u2014a process that quickly became familiar to browser users, who increasingly found themselves downloading Java applets to run on screen animations and perform specialized tasks.",
        "Today, code moves fluidly around networks\u2014both wired and wireless\u2014and may take up residence wherever there is available memory.",
        "Once resident on a device, it takes control of that device\u2019s actions\u2014usefully, in the case of the software that runs your MP3 player, cellphone, or automobile, but destructively in the case of the virus that attaches itself to an incoming email message, takes over your PC, displays a mocking message, then wipes out your hard disk.",
        "Function is fungible; you download the reader with the file, the TV set with the television signal.",
        "Dematerialized and radically mobilized code has become allied with the memory and computation capability now embedded in gadgets and machines of all kinds and with the increasingly comprehensive networking of these devices.",
        "Together they create a powerful, ubiquitous, rapidly growing structure of commands, conventions, and controls.",
        "Increasingly, we live out our daily lives within its invisible boundaries.",
        "As the Y2K scare and related efforts to track down and fix errant code revealed, its grip has quickly become global and inescapable.16 Code is mobile.",

        "The earliest extant examples are daubed on the walls of caves, and they are inseparable from the sites of their creation.",
        "But, like texts, pictures have lost weight and mobilized themselves in more recent times.",
        "The first move was to the walls of buildings.",
        "These provided more convenient working surfaces and allowed the development of sophisticated, precisely controllable graphic techniques\u2014that of fresco painting, for example.",
        "The permanent presence of a picture often determined space use.",
        "An altarpiece in a church, for example, oriented worship; today it might provide churches an opportunity to charge tourists for admission.",
        "Application of drawing and painting skills to smaller, lighter, more portable surfaces\u2014wooden panels, stretched canvases, sheets of paper, and the like\u2014was an obvious next step.",
        "In nomadic and partially nomadic cultures, such as that of the Mughuls, the process of lightening was carried to its logical extreme, and the form of the highly portable miniature emerged.",
        "All this had surprisingly far reaching consequences.",
        "It shifted picture production from construction sites to specialized painters\u2019 studios, and it greatly facilitated the buying and selling, transfer, collection and accumulation of pictures.",
        "And pictures became temporary installations in spaces (particularly galleries) rather than permanent features\u2014allowing for reprogramming of spaces by changing the stuff on the walls.",
        "Portability also allowed topographic views to be made on the spot, often in the open air, then carried away to serve as visual evidence of distant places.",
        "During the great ages of exploration, in particular, expeditions were rarely without their skilled artists.",
        "The idea of eyewitness visual reportage emerged, and the construction of a vast, continually expanding visual record of the world began.",
        "The trouble with this record, of course, was its vulnerability to inaccuracy, error, and falsehood.",
        "But technology soon came to the rescue.",
        "Development of perspective projection techniques helped artists (when they wanted to) to achieve higher levels of optical accuracy.",
        "Automated projection devices, such as the camera obscura, were even more effective; it seems likely that Vermeer, for one, relied heavily upon them.18 Fox Talbot took the crucial step of mounting a small sheet of photosensitive material, within a light tight box, behind a lens.",
        "This provided a fast, precise, automatic way of attaching shaded perspective images to silver atoms smeared on glass or paper.",
        "The technological history of photography, from that point on, is a chronicle of miniaturization, acceleration, and increasingly efficient distribution.",
        "Emulsions became finer grained and faster, exposures became effectively instantaneous, large format glass plates gave way to 35 mm film, tripods mostly disappeared, and cameras became smaller, lighter, and more portable.",
        "Photographs accumulated in albums and archives.",
        "Through halftoning, photography was combined with printing, and illustrated books, magazines, and newspapers began to flood the world.",
        "Photographers, photojournalists, and photo editors increasingly took over creation of the rapidly expanding visual record\u2014a record that gained authority not only from its verisimilitude, but also from the fact that rectangles of emulsion coated material had, potentially verifiably, been exposed at particular moments in particular places.",
        "The photographer, unlike the muralist or studio bound painter, could claim, \"I was there.\u201d The era of photography\u2014of relatively lightweight, easily produced, inexpensive, efficiently reproduced and distributed, optically accurate, verifiable images\u2014lasted for about a century and a half.",
        "Then in the 1990s, attached atoms got the coup de grace.",
        "CCD arrays began to replace photographic film on the picture planes of cameras, images were captured and stored as completely dematerialized digital files, and digital photography rapidly became commonplace.",
        "Image processing software running on personal computers replaced developing tanks and enlargers and shifted the sites of image crafting from darkrooms to desktops.",
        "Digital cameras were combined with cellphones, so that digital images became part of synchronous discourse.",
        "Simultaneously, the explosively growing World Wide Web provided a way to distribute digital images with unprecedented speed, cost effectiveness, and geographic coverage.",
        "Pornographers were, of course, among the first to discover that graphic Web sites beat the printed page.",
        "FILMLESS MOVIES Moving images were almost weightless from the beginning.",
        "Some early display devices featured photographs attached to revolving disks or drums, but these were hopelessly cumbersome and only good for a few seconds of flickering motion.",
        "Before long, sprocketed transparent film had become the standard\u2014allowing splicing, editing, and movie narratives of unlimited length, the results being projected up to mural size.",
        "But unlike murals, of course, these projected images were not attached to the underlying surfaces; they were ephemeral, completely immaterial overlays\u2014repeatable versions of the moving images that had been projected by the camera obscura.",
        "Electronics eventually eliminated even the residual materiality of the projected image.",
        "Video cameras encoded moving images as electromagnetic signals, which could be broadcast through the air, carried through a wire, or recorded on magnetic tape, then displayed (for as long as the signal lasted) on a phosphor coated screen.",
        "In the digital era, CCD arrays were quickly incorporated in video cameras, and digital signals, recording media, and displays replaced their analog predecessors.",
        "In microcosm, the technology of classroom and business presentations has recapitulated this chronicle of progressive dematerialization.",
        "First there were slates, blackboards, and whiteboards, which presented text and images as thin, removable layers of atoms on flat surfaces.",
        "Then came slide and transparency projectors, which shrunk these layers, and displaced them from the display surface to a plane near the light source.",
        "And finally, there were PCs, Powerpoint, MPG clips, and video projectors.",
        "By now, cyberspace contains the largest and most mobile accumulation of still and motion pictures the world has ever known\u2014far more extensive than the greatest picture gallery, photo or film archive, or library of illustrated books.",
        "Some of it resides in organized image archives, such as Corbis\u2014a direct successor to the stock photo archives of earlier days, but much of it is simply scattered across the Web\u2019s innumerable pages and reveals itself piecemeal as we surf.",
        "As a result, the average weight of the images we encounter each day is asymptotically approaching zero.",
        "INVISIBLE MONEY Coins are a fascinating special case of text and images with atoms attached\u2014lots of them.",
        "Originally, the value of a coin was that of its constituent metal; minting merely served to standardize the weight and therefore the value.",
        "So the forger\u2019s only option was to substitute some less precious atoms.19 The process of abstraction, miniaturization, and dematerialization of money began when coins became metonyms\u2014fragments representing larger stocks of precious metal or other valuable items stored in some safe place, and available to pay debts if necessary.",
        "Size and weight were no longer direct indicators of value; these properties became graphic design decisions.",
        "You needed to know who was backing up the value with their treasury, so (following Alexander the Great) the embossed head of the sovereign usually appeared.",
        "This allowed currency units to be smaller, lighter, and easier to carry.",
        "And, to support geographically extended systems of exchange, they could be moved around at stagecoach or railroad speed.",
        "It was then a short step from metal to paper\u2014that is, to bills of exchange, checks, and banknotes.",
        "Paper was lighter still, and particularly convenient for large denominations, which would otherwise require burdensome quantities of coinage.",
        "(Smugglers and money launderers are particularly fond of high value banknotes, like the 500 Euro, since their great value to weight ratio allows easy concealment for transfer through checkpoints.) And paper was essentially valueless in itself, so forgers turned their attention from adulterating the material to creating convincing facsimiles of the printed text and images.",
        "Once metallurgists, they now became graphic artists.",
        "Paper money further loosened the connection between material content and value, so that value now became an abstract policy variable.",
        "By issuing more paper, and postponing redemption, governments could pay for things.",
        "Until 1973, the Bretton Woods system attempted to stabilize currency values by defining them in terms of gold, but that practice has now been almost universally abandoned.",
        "These days, paper money primarily provides convenience, and serves to reduce transaction costs in the everyday exchanges that drive market economies.",
        "Meanwhile, the telegraph introduced the possibility of wiring money, and created a profitable business for Western Union.",
        "By this point, financial transfers no longer required the exchange of metal or paper, but could be accomplished simply by rewriting numbers from column to column in the ledgers of financial institutions.",
        "And this rewriting could be triggered by suitable electronic messages.",
        "This increased the speed and further reduced the cost of transactions at a distance.",
        "The modalities of theft correspondingly multiplied; you could stick up banks or armored cars to get your hands on physical tokens, you could forge those tokens, you could take the white collar option of fiddling the ledgers to your advantage, or you could subvert the telecommunications system to commit wire fraud.",
        "With computers and digital telecommunications, the ledgers became online databases, software began to manage electronic trans fers, and money acquired a complex, hybrid representation.20 Heavy, durable coins still have a residual function; people carry them in small quantities, and use them to feed parking meters, Coke machines, subway turnstiles, and other electromechanical devices.",
        "Banknotes are folded in wallets and are employed for larger purchases.",
        "Light plastic credit cards and debit cards are also carried in wallets; these carry electronic identification and can be inserted into reading devices that will trigger electronic transfers or disgorge banknotes.",
        "Transponder equipped smart cards and keychain devices (such as Speedpass and SmarTrip) transmit billing information to gas pumps, subway turnstiles, vending machines, and other payment points.21 Online, you don\u2019t even need the plastic; the credit card number suffices to initiate a transaction.",
        "Some pioneering dot coms, like PayPal, have gone further, demonstrating the possibility of emailing money or even beaming it from one portable, wireless device to another.",
        "In larger quantities, completely abstracted and dematerialized money now flows from institution to institution at breathtaking speed through electronic trading systems and funds transfer networks.22 Encrypted electronic transfer can cut transaction costs to the point where micropayments become imaginable.",
        "Potentially, this radically reduces the granularity of transactions.",
        "Instead of purchasing a complete book, you might make a micropayment each time you access a page online.",
        "Similarly, you might make a micropayment whenever you download and replay a recorded musical performance.",
        "Conversely, you can make huge payments\u2014the equivalents of truckloads of banknotes\u2014in an instant.",
        "Electronics releases us from traditional constraints on transfer scale and granularity.",
        "Furthermore, financial transactions need not be restricted to the direct digital equivalents of coins and banknotes; they can involve complex abstractions, such as derivatives\u2014entities that could not exist anyplace other than cyberspace.",
        "And transactions may no longer be under direct human control\u2014the electronic equivalents of handing over cash; they may become highly automated, as with programmed stock trading.",
        "Architecture has reflected money\u2019s evolving abstraction, dematerialization, and retreat from visibility.",
        "Banks used to be built around their fortified vaults\u2014the places where wealth accumulated in the most literal sense.",
        "They were serviced by highly visible armored vehicles and located prominently within communities to facilitate deposits and withdrawals of coins and notes.",
        "Later, automated teller machines combined electronic transfer capabilities with miniature, automatically operated vaults to provide more effective geographic coverage and 24 hour service.",
        "At around the same time, retail stores and restaurants installed unobtrusive electronic card readers at points of sale in place of grand mechanical cash registers.",
        "Then networked personal computers allowed financial transactions to be performed online, just about anywhere.",
        "As money has emancipated itself from the last vestiges of materiality, sites of accumulation and transfer\u2014once prominent, architecturally celebrated urban elements\u2014have waned into commodified electronic boxes, anonymous server farms, and out ofsight back offices.",
        "MOBILIZED MUSIC To mobilize music, you need to detach it not only from the site of its initial performance but also from the moment.",

        "Musical themes and ideas diffused through face to face contact at performance times.",
        "Maybe you improvised together\u2014much as jazz musicians still do.",
        "You had to be there.",
        "From the ninth century in Europe, musical notation has provided a way to externalize the musician\u2019s memory\u2014to write down and preserve specifications for performances of a work.",
        "The first music books then functioned, as Nelson Goodman put it in a famous definition, as \"the authoritative identification of a work from performance to performance.\u201d This served, among other things, to establish a uniform liturgical practice dictated by the church authorities, and to limit the scope for improvisation.",
        "The practice of writing down musical scores distinguished logically between composers and performers (though, of course, one person might sometimes perform both roles), and separated music, in subtle but profound ways, from art forms such as painting.",
        "Painters do not normally set out to comply with scripts or scores; their works are the unique products of particular authors, working at particular times, in particular places.",
        "In Goodman\u2019s terminology, they are autographic.",
        "But scored or scripted works may have indefinite numbers of performances, at different moments and locations; they are allographic.23 Allographic works may be performed not only by human artists, but also by mechanical devices equipped with the capacity to follow appropriately encoded scores.",
        "At the end of the nineteenth century, Edwin S.",
        "Votey\u2019s pianola vividly demonstrated this possibility.",
        "In its earliest form, it consisted of a large wooden cabinet that stood in front of a standard piano.",
        "Felt covered wooden levers, protruding from the rear, were aligned with the piano keyboard.",
        "Sequences of notes were encoded as perforations on paper rolls, which controlled the operation of these mechanical fingers.",
        "Pianola rolls could be recorded at a keyboard, or more usually, perforated by a technician working directly from a score.",
        "In the decades that followed, more sophisticated player pianos and reproducing pianos emerged, and supported two distinct streams of practice.",
        "Frequently, player piano technology was employed to capture and reproduce keyboard performances by famous artists\u2014producing, for example, an important legacy of jazz and ragtime from that era.",
        "At other times, composers used the technology as a way to transcend the limitations of the human hand.",
        "In the 1930s, the era of the player piano was brought to an end by the depression and increasing competition from the less expensive, more compact and versatile gramophone.",
        "The gramophone, like its immediate ancestor, the phonograph, dealt directly in vibrations.",
        "In 1877 Thomas Edison had successfully demonstrated a \"tinfoil phonograph\u201d based upon a foil wrapped cylindrical drum mounted on a threaded axle.",
        "A diaphragm connected to a stylus picked up acoustic vibrations and etched corresponding wave patterns on the rotating foil.",
        "For playback, a pickup stylus retraced the wave patterns and transmitted the vibrations to the more sensitive diaphragm of the \"reproducer.\u201d Edison recited, \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\u201d into the mouthpiece and replayed the mechanical, tinny sounding echo.",
        "There was a compelling symmetry to the Edison process, and Edison saw his device as a personal recorder\u2014much like later tape recorders.",
        "But by the 1890s a commercial recording industry was developing.",
        "Musicians recorded performances, then record companies mass produced and distributed them as closed, branded items of intellectual property.",
        "Eventually there emerged a commercial and legal regime under which consumers could do little more than replay recordings in private; their rights to public replay, to re recording, and to incorporation of recorded material in new works were severely restricted.",
        "Recording interests deployed a criminalizing rhetoric of \"theft\u201d and \"piracy\u201d to protect their position.",
        "As the popularity of radio broadcasting rose rapidly in the 1920s, the recording and broadcasting industries converged both technologically and commercially.",
        "The emergence of RCA Victor\u2014formed after the Radio Corporation of America\u2019s acquisition of the Victor Talking Machine Company\u2014was a decisive moment.",
        "Electric microphones and amplifiers replaced the phonograph\u2019s mechanical systems.",
        "Recording and broadcast were both centrally concerned with capturing, recording, and distributing electrical audio signals.",
        "Sound quality improved, artists could have individual microphones instead of clustering around shared recording horns, and recordings could be edited and recombined.",
        "From the birth of the phonograph to the dawn of the digital era, competing recording media proliferated\u2014evolving in the direction of greater fidelity, reduced cost, and reduction in bulk and weight.",
        "Phonograph cylinders were manufactured from tinfoil, then wax coated cardboard, then solid wax.",
        "Gramophone disks, which first emerged in the 1890s, were made from hard rubber, shellac, vinyl, and even, as a curiosity, from chocolate, with various diameters, and speeds of 78rpm, 331/3rpm, or 45rpm.",
        "Wire recorders enjoyed brief popularity.",
        "Magnetic tape was packaged in reel to reel and cassette formats, in varying widths, and with differing numbers of tracks.",
        "It was an extended effort to minimize the attachment of atoms to music.",
        "By 1979, with the introduction of Sony\u2019s Walkman, records and players had shrunk to wearable size.",
        "The inevitable move from analog to digital recording formats began in the 1980s, with the introduction of compact disks (CDs) and digital audio tapes (DATs).",
        "But the personal computer and the Internet introduced a far more revolutionary possibility\u2014that of capturing, editing, and replaying audio files at any computer, storing them online, and distributing them throughout the world, at high speed, in dematerialized form.",
        "Standards to support this new practice began to emerge, and eventually MP3 took hold globally.24 To the consternation of the Recording Industry Association of America, there was soon software to rip MP3 files from CDs and the digital equivalents of the Walkman (notably the Rio MP3 player) for storing and replaying them.",
        "Furthermore, an infrastructure to support online music distri bution\u2014particularly directories of available files, search engines, download managers, and software MP3 players\u2014quickly followed.",
        "Napster, which appeared in 1999, was the most radically and visibly challenging to the established distribution systems.",
        "The key idea of Napster was to coordinate a highly decentralized, peer to peer, Web based distribution system.25 It maintained a central, online directory of available MP3 files but did not store the files themselves on its servers.",
        "Instead, Napster users stored files locally and made them available for sharing.",
        "When users wanted files they did not have, Napster\u2019s search engine located these files and downloaded them.",
        "As the new century dawned, Napster\u2019s intellectual (if not commercial) success could be measured by the way that it was clogging networks and attracting lawsuits from the established recording industry.",
        "It had completed the job of dematerial izing and radically mobilizing recorded music.26 GRANARIES TO SERVER FARMS In the b.d.",
        "(Before Dematerialization) era, settlements were built around fixed, central sites of material accumulation\u2014typically of excess, storable agricultural produce such as grain.",
        "Consider Palladio\u2019s villas in the Veneto, from about the fourth century b.d., for example.",
        "They were surrounded by grain fields, vineyards, orchards, and housing for barnyard animals.",
        "The harvested grain was stored in the attic (where it also provided insulation), the wine and cheese were stored in the basement (where they remained at an appropriate temperature), and the consumers lived on the grand piano nobile sandwiched in between.",
        "Since transportation relied upon muscle power, it mattered a great deal that distances from the fields to the storage areas were short, and that those from storage to consumption were even shorter.",
        "There was a clear spatial logic and a wonderful visual clarity to it all; you could take it in at a glance.",
        "Then, as increasingly efficient transportation technologies emerged, large cities were organized around extensive distribution networks that incorporated diverse, specialized production, accumulation, and consumption sites.",
        "Since transportation costs remained fairly high relative to the value of the things transported, and since transportation over long distances took significant amounts of time, the locations of these sites were largely determined by accessibility considerations; warehouses, for example, needed to be sufficiently accessible both to the factories that supplied them and to the customers they served.",
        "Thus, the great industrial cities of the second century b.d., such as Chicago, were shaped by their rail networks.",
        "And those of the first century b.d., like Los Angeles, were given form by their freeways.",
        "To an observer on the ground, these extended systems made little sense, but from high in the air you could immediately see how they worked.",
        "At the dawn of the a.d.",
        "(After Dematerialization) era\u2014around Y2K in the older calendar system\u2014yet another pattern emerged.",
        "Servers and server farms embedded in high speed telecommunication networks became the crucial, characteristic accumulation sites of new urban formations.",
        "Unlike their predecessors, such as granaries, warehouses, bank vaults, and library book stacks, these sites stored dema terialized assets\u2014that is, texts, images, video, music, computer code, and money\u2014in digital format.",
        "They were notably inconspicuous, since they consumed relatively little space, were kept discreetly anonymous for security purposes, and offered little opportunity for architectural celebration.",
        "Furthermore, they were spatially ambiguous; the common practices of creating backup copies at multiple locations, caching copies at locations near to likely users, distributing databases over numerous different servers, and continually migrating material to new storage hardware made it difficult to specify exactly where particular items were located.",
        "(A Web document is not, for example, like a valuable manuscript, such as the Book of Kells, which is perma nently stored at a well known, specific location in Trinity College, Dublin.) And as networks became increasingly pervasive and efficient, the costs of transporting digital items to and from servers were reduced to insignificance relative to the value of the goods; centrality of location no longer mattered much, and important servers could operate effectively in out of the way locations.",
        "Finally, with the development of inexpensive, miniaturized electronics, the production and consumption sites related to these servers increasingly dispersed, mobilized, and began to associate themselves with footloose individuals rather than fixed architectural settings.",
        "Today, you can download to your portable wireless devices, you can upload from them, and it is of little importance where the servers you access happen to be.",
        "Mostly, you don\u2019t know or care.",

        "There was no simple way to know that the \u201cexplosions\u201d were special effects.",
        "If you were too far away to be a potential eyewitness yourself (it was clever of Welles to set ground zero on an isolated farm in New Jersey) and too uneducated to catch the scientific howlers (Welles deployed a \u201cgreat astronomer\u201d and other scientific authority figures to deflect critical scrutiny of the details), it was impossible to distinguish fact from falsehood.",
        "Electronic signals had demonstrated that they could construct the most outlandish of beliefs and provoke people to act instantly on those beliefs.",
        "It was the power of the electronic present continuous voice\u2014the presumed direct connection to simultaneously unfolding, distant events\u2014that caused the trouble.",
        "The damage had been done long before Welles got to his final (retrospective voice) disclaimer: This is Orson Welles, ladies and gentlemen, out of character to assure you that The War of the Worlds has no further significance than the holiday offering it was intended to be\u2014the Mercury Theater\u2019s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying \u201cBoo!\u201d Starting now, we couldn\u2019t soap all your windows and steal all your garden gates by tomorrow night\u2014so we did the best next thing.",

        "When the hijacked jetliners hit the World Trade Center towers, around nine o\u2019clock in the morning on Tuesday, September 11, 2001, the unfolding events were narrated in thousands of phone calls and instant messages; it was a desperately improvised, scaled up replay of War of the Worlds \u2014but with nobody to step reassuringly out of character at the end.",
        "In cities today, electronically propagated narratives flow constantly and increasingly densely.",
        "These narratives\u2014superimposed, as they are, on real space in real time\u2014act as feedback loops recursively transforming the very situations that produce them.",

        "In Hugh Kenner\u2019s well known reading, Ulysses is the voice of a cybernetic mechanism\u2014 \u201ca huge and intricate machine, clanking and whirring for eighteen hours\u201d;8 now narrative has rebounded from the pages where novelists had consigned it and has itself become the city\u2019s cybernetic machinery.",
        "In the late 1920s (not long before the publication of Ulysses), Dziga Vertov, in Man with the Movie Camera, constructed a closely comparable, day long urban portrait\u2014this time of a Soviet city.9 Like the novel, the film begins with the protagonists awakening in the morning and carries the narrative through the day\u2019s activities to the late evening, intercutting multiple strands of action as it goes.",
        "It selfconsciously introduces, on camera, the camera itself, the cameraman, the film, the projector, the projectionist, the theater, the audience, the orchestra, and the flickering screen.",
        "And, every now and again, it tweaks us into sudden awareness of the paradoxical nature of its enterprise\u2014for example, by pulling back to reveal that what we took to be a direct view of the city is actually a filmed view, being projected at a later moment before the theater audience.",
        "It reminds us that the movie camera and theater represent a dismemberment of the old camera obscura\u2014shifting the glowing projection screen to a different darkened box from the camera lens and temporally displacing the beam of light that enters the system from that which exits.",
        "Vertov\u2019s ribbon of spliced celluloid also foregrounds the central, inescapable contradiction of all recorded narrative\u2014the bafflement that, for example, animates Tristram Shandy, in which Tristram\u2019s Uncle Toby starts an autobiography that is slower paced than the events it describes and falls more and more hopelessly behind as life inexorably goes on.",
        "You simply cannot sync recorded narratives with the events they describe.",
        "That\u2019s what you need tense for.",
        "You can set your narrative in the past, so that it continuously recedes into the distance.",

        "Or you can try the eyewitness present continuous voice\u2014 but you had better be quicker than Uncle Toby.",
        "In any case, the spans of time occupied by the actual events unfolding, the writer writing about them, and the reader reading, will generally be different.",
        "But link a video camera to the Web, and these distinctions collapse; Uncle Toby\u2019s paradox suddenly dissolves.",
        "You now get Ulysses II, unfolding second by second, in real time.",
        "Today you can surf into the Web site of the Irish Times, from anywhere in the world, at any time, to get live Webcam views of the O\u2019Connell Bridge and the Liffey.",
        "Or you can click to the Dublin Corporation\u2019s numerous traffic cameras for views of the streets\u2014now car choked\u2014that Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Buck Mulligan strode.",
        "And I\u2019m not even counting the private surveillance cameras scattered discreetly around Temple Bar.",
        "It\u2019s not just Dublin, of course.",
        "A century after Buck Mulligan roused himself to peer down the stairs, the multiple narrative perspectives of the characters in Ulysses have become endlessly proliferating, live video feeds from the world\u2019s cities.",
        "In the emerging Webcam era, the city\u2019s cybernetic loops are not only audio and text narratives, but video streams as well.",
        "As cities electronically reflect back on themselves, telling is now joined by showing.",
        "Like Joyce in far off Trieste, distant Web surfers can construct minutely detailed accounts of the day\u2019s doings in places that may interest them\u2014not by a novelist\u2019s occupation of the minds of his characters, nor by a filmmaker\u2019s shooting and editing, but by following hyperlinks to switch among available video viewpoints.",
        "And as to the mode of consciousness induced by this strategy, it is precisely that detected by Hugh Kenner in Ulysses \u2014the mode of a \"sardonic, impersonal recorder, that constantly glints its photoelectric eyes from behind the chronicle of Bloomsday.\u201d10 MANN WITH THE VIDEO CAM Joyce disclosed Dublin by mobilizing his characters, and film or video makers do so by mobilizing their cameras.",
        "Thus the agility of the available cameras matters.",
        "Indeed, much of the now standard language of film derives directly from the bulk and clumsiness of early movie cameras.",
        "Vertov\u2019s camera, as the film itself reveals, was a large, hand cranked box on a tripod.",
        "(Uncle Toby would have appreciated that, the faster the cameraman cranked, the slower the eventual projected scene unfolded.) Consequently, many of the shots in Man with the Movie Camera are framed statically; there are a few pans, and only an occasional, daring take from the back of a moving truck.",
        "The film\u2019s sense of frantic movement through the city is mostly achieved through skillful construction of fast paced montages.",
        "Hollywood has long attempted to overcome the limitations of the camera, and to achieve greater fluidity, by introducing sophisticated motion machinery.",
        "For example, the famous extended tracking shot through a Mexican border town, at the beginning of Orson Welles\u2019s Touch of Evil, was a tour de force of the mechanized camera crane.",
        "And, more recently, robotically controlled cameras have been increasingly used for precisely choreographed special effects work.",
        "The miniaturization of film and video technology has also loosened things up.",
        "In particular, the development of light, handheld film and video cameras has enabled a first person, body based style; the camera operator\u2019s mobile eye seems to become the viewer\u2019s eye, and the voiceover commentary seems a whisper in the viewer\u2019s ear.",
        "This is characteristic of home videos, and it has been common in documentaries.",
        "It has also been used to great effect in a few theatrical films, such as The Blair Witch Project.",
        "It was a short technological step from this to the wearable, head mounted video camera\u2014a possibility I first saw instantiated, in the early 1990s, when a talented Media Lab student named Steve Mann walked into my MIT office with video rolling.11 If you have enough wireless bandwidth, you can connect a handheld or head mounted video camera to a transmitter.",
        "You can (as Mann did) transmit sequences of images to a Web site for later viewing.",
        "Or, as the rollout of G3 cellphone technology demonstrated in 2001, you can transmit live video through a wireless telephone.",
        "Thus the \"cinema eye\u201d and the \"radio ear\u201d\u2014technologies that Vertov had seen as alternative ways of reaching the masses\u2014are combined and mobilized.",
        "The ultimate in camera miniaturization and mobilization is the \"virtual camera\u201d of three dimensional computer graphics, which shrinks to a weightless point.",
        "The effect of this was vividly evident in the early Disney computer animation Tron, in which the \"camera\u201d performs high speed gymnastics that would be unthinkable with a physical device.",
        "Now, such effects are commonplace in videogames, and in the exploration of online \"virtual cities,\u201d such as Virtual Helsinki.",
        "If model based video eventually replaces today\u2019s image based systems, as some researchers expect, the dimensionless, infinitely mobile camera will become the norm; instead of watching a sporting event through the medium of a few physical cameras and the shots selected by a director, a viewer might \"fly\u201d at will through a live three dimensional model of the stadium.",
        "Through miniaturization and mobilization of video cameras, wireless connection, and model based video, the stiff, distant images provided by fixed Webcams will soon be supplanted by fluid, eyewitness perspectives.",

        "There is simply an unmarked tense drift.",
        "When the hijacked airliners hit the World Trade Center towers on September 11, the moment was captured on video.",
        "For hours afterward, in a kind of pornography of explosive violence, the clips were replayed over and over again.",
        "On screen, it was hard to tell the difference between the identical towers, and tense drift added another layer of nightmarish ambiguity.",
        "As growing numbers of people, around the world, tuned in to these images on their television and computer screens, it often wasn\u2019t clear to them whether they were watching events in real time or replays.",
        "As the broadcasts cut back and forth between live and recorded images of the same unfolding scene, this tragedy drifted away from the classical unities.",

        "In the darkened Postmasters Gallery, Wolfgang Staehle\u2019s live feed video projection of the Lower Manhattan skyline (which had opened on September 6) sliced the unfolding chaos into a sequence of eerily silent, luminous landscape stills.12 And, in a suddenly sinister way, Staehle\u2019s successive stills recalled a Photoshop demo; duplicate, erase, paint in some sky effects, eventually substitute something else.",
        "Today, a fundamentally new urban condition is emerging\u2014one that was anticipated by Joyce\u2019s repeated, sardonic reference to Dublin as Doublin\u2019, a city marinated in narrative, and inescapably bound up with narrative\u2019s capacity both for reflection and for duplicity.",
        "Multiplying thousands of electronic eyes and ears continuously capture the city\u2019s unfolding, interwoven narrative threads, and spin them out into cyberspace.",
        "Some of these threads are ephemeral, and disappear instantly.",

        "If you want to send a message that is spatially specific but temporally indefinite, you can inscribe it on a wall, and if you want to send one that is specific to a portable object, you can affix a label.",
        "Conversely, if you have a sports score or race result that is of instant interest over a wide area, you can broadcast it.",
        "If the message is location specific but varies with time, as with the flight information posted at an airline departure gate, you can use a LED display.",
        "If it is spatially and temporally universal, as with a mathematical or scientific result, you might publish it in multiple copies for wide distribution and consultation at indeterminate future dates.",
        "If the intended recipient is within sight and earshot, as when you yell to a running child, you do not require any additional technology to assist in achieving spatial and temporal specificity.",
        "But if the recipient is out of immediate sensory range\u2014as when an air traffic controller gives instructions to a pilot\u2014some sort of location awareness technology is necessary; specifically, the controller watches the aircraft on a radarscope.",
        "In our wirelessly interconnected world, electronic location awareness is becoming commonplace.2 Wireless signals, like sounds, encode information about their sources.",
        "By various means, it is possible to discover their directions of origin, and deduce their likely distances.",
        "Consequently, the coordinates of portable wireless devices, and of the objects and bodies that bear them, can be tracked.3 Unlike the world of the ancient nomad, the world of the wireless cyborg is inherently one of traceable positions and trajectories.",
        "This provides an increasingly crucial new way to weave together cities, their inhabitants, and digital information.",
        "You can tag information according to its geographic origin, you can keep track of rela tionships between places and bits, and you wirelessly deliver bits to exactly where they are needed and make sense.",
        "Instead of being part of the city\u2019s fixed infrastructure, for example, a stop sign might automatically appear on your dashboard, in response to current traffic conditions, as you drove up to an intersection.4 LOCATION TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES One approach to extracting spatial coordinates is simply to measure the strength and direction of a received signal to get an indication of the transmitter\u2019s distance from you.",
        "This is particularly useful if you are searching for a transmitter, since the signal gets stronger as you move toward it.",
        "Thus, in a common application, small transmitters in automobiles allow them to be tracked and located when they are stolen.",
        "If you are using a cellular system, the cellular operator can keep track of the base stations to which you link as you move around.",
        "Measurements of signal strength are used to control switching between base stations.",
        "When a call is made or received, the system detects the nearest base station and logs a phone location code in a database.",
        "In urban areas with high densities of base stations, this typically establishes location to within a few hundred feet, and also allows approximate motion tracking as mobile callers move from cell to cell.",
        "As cellular systems move to higher bandwidths and carry heavier traffic, cells will get smaller and this sort of tracking will become more precise.",
        "Another way to get more precise location codes it to measure signal strength at three base stations.",
        "This provides sufficient information to compute a location code by triangulation.",
        "This will probably be done increasingly as phone location codes are put to more and more practical uses.",
        "Phone location codes are, of course, a decidedly mixed blessing.",
        "They provide telecommunications companies with billing information and traffic statistics.",
        "If available to governments, they can be used for the most chilling kind of comprehensive citizen surveillance, and if available to telemarketers they can be used to direct pinpoint junk mail right to your phone.5 They can also be used by the police and the military for real time tracking of targets; terrorists have learned that cellphone calls may be answered by missiles.",
        "More benignly, they allow 911, roadside emergency, and taxi calls to be tagged automatically with caller coordinates.",
        "In today\u2019s Dublin, you wouldn\u2019t need a novelist\u2019s omniscience to follow Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Buck Mulligan around the city; you could just track their cellphone usage.",
        "And if Leopold could get access to the logs, he could figure out precisely what Molly was up to.",
        "Yet another approach is to set up special radio beacons at known locations; wireless equipped travelers can then measure the time taken for signals to reach them from different beacons, convert those times to distances, and thus calculate their current positions by triangulation.",
        "This is, of course, a translation of ancient surveying and navigational techniques into wireless processes, and there are many variations on the idea.",
        "Loran navigation systems, for example, employ high powered radio beacons at fixed locations.",
        "At a smaller scale, some three dimensional digitizers and location trackers make use of ultrasonic beepers and strip microphones.",
        "And ultra wideband localizers can now make use of radio frequency (RF) transceivers distributed in the environment to provide centimeter accuracy over kilometer distances.6 THE GPS SYSTEM The most comprehensive and sophisticated infrastructure for wireless location and navigation is provided by the global positioning system (GPS), which was completed, in its original form, by the U.S.",
        "Department of Defense in 1994.7 This system derives distances (and hence locations) from the amounts of time taken by radio signals to travel from satellite transmitters to ground based receivers.8 The GPS system is based upon twenty four satellites that circle the earth in a pattern that allows at least five to be seen from any location at any time.",
        "Each satellite contains a very precise clock, and the exact position of each satellite is known at any moment.",
        "The satellites transmit signals specifying their clock times and locations, and the times taken by these signals to reach a receiver establish the distances of the satellites from the receiver.",
        "Four of these signals provide enough information to compute the three dimensional location of the receiver.",
        "Remarkably, the system (when it isn\u2019t deliberately made less precise) is accurate to within a few meters\u2014good enough to navigate city streets.",
        "It was designed initially for military guidance systems but was soon extended to civilian ships and aircraft as well.",
        "By the year 2000, GPS systems were becoming routine equipment in automobiles, and inexpensive pocket sized models were popular equipment for hikers.",
        "They were getting built into cellphones to provide more accurate location based 911 capabilities.9 And they were even being incorporated into digital cameras, so that images could be stamped not only with the time of exposure, but also the place.",
        "By 2002, single chip GPS systems had been announced\u2014making it possible to integrate GPS capability into devices as small as wristwatches.",
        "INDOOR TRACKING Unfortunately, architectural features block GPS signals, so GPS tracking does not work indoors.",
        "Beacons located throughout a building can provide similar location tracking capabilities, but the task is complicated by the fact that buildings typically contain metal and other materials that affect the propagation of radio signals, producing interference and dead spots.",
        "The Cricket system, developed at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, deals with the difficulty by employing beacons that emit both radio and ultrasonic pulses.10 Since these travel at different speeds, the difference in their arrival time at a receiver can be used to compute distance\u2014much as you can compute the distance of a lightning flash by counting the seconds before you hear the sound of the thunder.",
        "By discovering the nearest beacon in this fashion, a location sensitive device can determine which room it is in.",
        "In the future, dense grids of inexpensive location beacons will become standard architectural features.",
        "These will enable indoor pedestrian navigation in much the same way that GPS supports automobile navigation, and they will allow spaces to advertise the facilities and services that they provide.",
        "The experiences of exploring a museum, searching for a product in a department store, or finding your car in a large parking garage will be transformed.",
        "RADAR, TRANSPONDERS, AND RF TAGS Radar and sonar tracking stations work in still another way\u2014by bouncing directional signals off moving planes, ships, thunderclouds, and other objects of interest.",
        "Conversely, mobile radar and sonar systems in land, sea, and air vehicles bounce signals off the surrounding topography to provide navigational information.",
        "The principle may be generalized; anything that propagates a signal into its surrounding environment, from a chirping bat to an 802.11 base station, can potentially employ the reflections of that signal to construct some sort of picture of its environment.",
        "Paul Virilio, ever alert to such things, has noted the panoptic potential of ubiquitous broadcasting; he imagines the world\u2019s television and FM radio transmitters organized into a gigantic surveillance engine that \"detects any activity, any movement, legitimate or otherwise.\u201d11 If you embed a transponder in an object, you can go further, and interrogate the object by directing a radio signal at it.",
        "Ground stations interrogate transponders in approaching aircraft to determine whether they are friendly or not, and electronic tollbooths interrogate transponders in automobiles to charge tolls.",
        "By broadcasting location queries to transponders in GPS equipped vehicles, you can keep constant track of where they are and how fast they are traveling\u2014 a capability of obvious interest to managers of delivery fleets, rental car operators, transportation planners who want traffic flow data, traffic police who want to keep speeding in check, and three letter agencies.12 Early transponders were bulky and expensive, but it is now possible to produce tiny, inexpensive ones on microchips and even to dispense with batteries or external power sources by harnessing the power of the incoming signal.",
        "RF tags, based upon this principle, are increasingly being sewn into clothing, embedded in electronic devices, and implanted in both animals and humans.13 We are rapidly approaching the point where anything might respond instantly to a wireless query about its identity, current location, or some other property.",
        "A transponder or RF tag might reply with something as simple as an identification number, much like the barcodes that are read by optical scanners.",
        "It might directly provide detailed information about its host object, as would a printed label.",
        "Less directly, it might provide the URL of a Web site that contained detailed information on its host.",
        "And if it is connected to sensors, it can provide current information about its host\u2019s condition; for example, the California Air Resources Board has proposed to equip vehicles with transponders connected to their emissions monitoring systems, so that malfunctioning vehicles automatically identify themselves\u2014the electronic equivalent of a scarlet A on your forehead.14 The most enthusiastic proponents of RFID project a world in which pretty much everything has a smart tag with a unique, 96 bit electronic product code (EPC) that can be read by a simple radio device and used instantly to connect it to the Internet and access an online database that contains the object\u2019s specifications and history\u2014its detailed digital shadow.15 Unlike printed labels, the electronic shadow is of unlimited size and can be dynamically updated.",
        "And by contrast with barcodes and readers, RFID is unobtrusive, scanning can be conducted at a distance, and the technology combines gracefully with wireless delivery of information from the Internet.",
        "Point a wireless device at an object with an EPC, and you can instantly learn all about it.",
        "RFID scanners might also be embedded in warehouse and store shelves for stock control, supermarket and library lanes for automated checkout, and your refrigerator for automated reordering of commodities.",

        "Instead of sticking something into a door to open it, you might just walk up, let the door interrogate your implanted RFID tag and check an authorization database, and have it automatically open.",
        "But it is also vividly obvious that transponders and tags, combined with location tracking, could open the way to unwanted surveillance\u2014of unprecedented precision, detail, and thoroughness.",
        "Since it is unlikely that they will just go away, they create an urgent need for sophisticated identity management systems that allow you to control exactly what you want to reveal about yourself, when you reveal it, and where you do so.16 URBAN INFORMATION OVERLAYS The most profound effect of electronic tracking, inscription, and interrogation techniques is, in combination and on a large scale, to change the fundamental mechanics of reference\u2014the ways in which we establish meaning, construct knowledge, and make sense of our surroundings by associating items of information with one another and with physical objects.17 The simplest way to associate information with physical objects is, of course, to inscribe text or images directly, and more or less permanently, onto their actual surfaces.",
        "This is the straightforward strategy of a manufacturer who puts a label on a soup can, a conference organizer who provides nametags, or a monumental mason who erects an inscribed headstone over a grave.",

        "He illustrated the point with the tale of the poet Simonides, who remembered exactly where guests had been sitting at a banquet when the roof of the hall collapsed, mangling them all beyond recognition.",
        "Cicero went on: He inferred that persons desiring to train this faculty (of memory) must select places and form mental images of the things they wish to remember and store those images in the places, so that the order of the places will preserve the order of the things, and the images of the things will denote the things themselves, and we shall employ the places and images respectively as a wax writing tablet and the letters written on it.32 This was the mythic origin of mnemotechnics\u2014the art of memory\u2014by means of which ancient orators could deliver long speeches from memory.",
        "Frances Yates has summarized the procedure, as described in detail by Quintilian: In order to form a series of places in memory, he says, a building is to be remembered, as spacious and varied a one as possible, the forecourt, the living room, the bedrooms, and parlors, not omitting statues and other ornaments with which the rooms are decorated.",
        "The images by which the speech is to be remembered\u2014as an example of these Quintilian says one may use an anchor or a weapon\u2014are then placed in imagination on the places which have been memorized in the building.",
        "This done, as soon as the memory of the facts requires to be revived, all these places are visited in turn and the various deposits demanded of their custodians.",
        "We have to think of the ancient orator as moving in imagination through his memory building whilst he is making his speech, drawing from the memorized places the images he has placed on them.33 In today\u2019s emerging electronic mnemotechnics, information is stored in digital devices rather than heads, it is associated with physical places through geocoding, it may be retrieved by actually moving from place to place, and it may be presented in multimedia format on devices such as see through video displays and audio earpieces.34 In this fashion, a whole city becomes a vast, collectively constructed memory palace that divulges its contents to inhabitants as they circulate through it.",
        "BITS COME HOME Long ago (somewhere around 1995), as today\u2019s digitally networked world was big banging into existence, it sometimes seemed that cyberspace might imitate, improve upon, and ultimately supplant physical space as the place to be.",

        "When you bake a cake in your kitchen, for example, you follow a recipe that may have arrived through the mail, you apply thermal energy that was most likely supplied in the form of piped gas, and you combine ingredients transported from around the world through a variety of transportation networks.",
        "When you laser print a piece of artwork in your office, the design arrives over a computer network, the electricity to activate the print mechanism is supplied by the grid, and the paper and toner cartridges (the weak link in this web) probably arrived by truck.",

        "Most are in fact put together from other artifacts; in other words, they emerge, through multistep processes, from supply networks.",
        "The nodes of these networks are sites at which materials are organized, according to some design, through the controlled application of energy.",
        "Today\u2014notably, for example, in the fabrication and assembly of electronic components\u2014these networks may extend globally, and production usually requires careful timing and coordination of parallel activities at multiple sites.",
        "In the era of craft production, multiple fabrication and assembly tasks were performed sequentially, at one location, in the craftsman\u2019s shop\u2014a strategy celebrated, for example, by William Morris.",

        "In today\u2019s network era, enhanced transportation and telecommunication capabilities allow greater spatial division of labor and, in effect, the expansion of assembly lines from factory to global scale.",
        "If you are a twenty first century producer, you don\u2019t just manage plants, you manage complex supply networks.",
        "DECENTRALIZED PRODUCTION When the machines that bring designs, energy, and materials together at nodes in supply networks are bulky, heavy, and expensive (as with high speed printing presses and CD burners), there are few of them, and their locations tend to be fixed.",
        "They are potential bottlenecks in the flow of production.",
        "Furthermore, as robber baron capitalists and Marxist revolutionaries knew equally well, they provide opportunities to acquire political power by grabbing the means of production.",
        "But when miniaturization allows the development and proliferation of small, inexpensive production devices (such as laser printers), redundancy can be introduced into supply networks.",
        "Production can often be decentralized and even mobilized.",
        "Under these conditions, political power can be distributed (and centralized power can be subverted) by producing such devices in quantity and spreading them around.",
        "Consider, for example, the evolution of the supply networks through which the humble ice cube cometh.",
        "The frozen water trade began, on a large scale, with the harvesting of big blocks of ice from New England lakes and rivers by means of ice plows.1 Increasingly efficient long distance bulk transportation networks made this possible.",
        "Blocks were stored in huge icehouses near the rural harvest points, transported by sailing ship to cities as distant as Calcutta, stored again in urban icehouses, and eventually distributed by ice cart to domestic iceboxes.",
        "By the 1880s large, steam driven artificial ice plants were becoming competitive\u2014particularly in warm locations far from the sources of natural ice; these depended upon water supply, energy supply, and local delivery networks, and they were a first step in decentralization of ice production.",
        "Then came electric supply networks, small electric motors, the invention of sealed container refrigeration, and mass produced domestic refrigerators.",
        "Ice production had been a centralized industrial activity, but by the 1950s it had fragmented and recombined with domestic space.",
        "Today small, automated ice makers are nodes in domestic electrical and plumbing networks, and bitesized ice cubes pop out of your refrigerator door; the distance from production point to your glass has shortened from thousands of kilometers to a few centimeters.",
        "Limits on network capacity, costs of transporting things through networks, and the losses incurred in transportation also play roles in establishing the relative advantages of centralized and decentralized production.",
        "Steelworks are often concentrated near sources of iron ore and coal, for example, since it is more expensive to transport these commodities over long distances than to transport the less bulky finished products.",
        "Ice plants were located near ice markets, since ice gradually melted during transportation.",
        "And the mills of the early industrial era were clustered around sites of water or steam power, since production machines had to be within range of the belts and other mechanical means that were used for transmitting power.",
        "But when the crucial networks become ubiquitous and efficient, as with modern electrical grids and the Internet, the importance of distance correspondingly diminishes; it hardly matters where you plug in a PC to download and print a document from a Web server.",
        "These effects are most pronounced, and perhaps most threatening to established industries, when mobilized, easily replicable software transforms large numbers of Internet nodes into a highly redundant, geographically dispersed, production and distribution system.",
        "Thus when music industry lawyers tried to shut down the KaZaA peer to peer file sharing system, they found that the developers were living in the Netherlands, the programmers were in Estonia, the location of the source code was unknown, the distributor was based in Australia but incorporated in Vanuatu, and installations were scattered over 60 million Internet users in 150 countries.2 In the long run, the established music industry had about as much chance as the New England ice harvesters.",
        "PERSONALIZED PRODUCTION Traditionally, industrial production has sought scale economies.",
        "To compete effectively, industrialists built big, fast machines that turned out long runs of standard products at the lowest possible cost.",
        "(The higher the investments in this machinery, the more intensively it had to be used.) But decentralized, personal production is more concerned with personalization\u2014that is, with smaller runs of products that may be more expensive but are more precisely adapted to the specific requirements of particular contexts.",
        "It is the difference between a high speed newspaper press and your personal laser printer.",
        "You can provide for customization by equipping a production device with lots of knobs and dials.",
        "A really good manual camera, for example, is festooned with gadgets you can adjust and set, and provides a photographer with extraordinary control of the subtle qualities of images.",
        "A point and shoot camera, by contrast, efficiently produces a highly standardized product and, since it doesn\u2019t have to provide so many external control points, is usually a smaller, cleaner, and simpler looking object.",
        "As production devices have acquired embedded intelligence, a new possibility has emerged; you can control (or hack) them by sending them streams of bits.",
        "So your laser printer can produce different pages, and your MP3 player can produce different sounds, depending upon the digital input.",
        "At another level, if you have the programming skills, you can mess with the resident code that interprets such input\u2014so altering the types of products that are output.",
        "At more industrial scales, numerically controlled (NC) production machinery has gradually been taking over from older, more cumbersome, manually controlled devices.",
        "At first, NC machinery was driven by paper tape; now it is run directly by computers.",
        "The shift to NC reduces setup costs and the need for close manual control and so allows production of varied output without crippling cost penalties.",
        "Thus a numerically controlled laser cutter can efficiently produce highly varied shapes from sheet material, and a numerically controlled deposition printer can produce three dimensional solids.",
        "By the 1990s this shift was vividly being reflected in architecture; buildings like Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao were no longer constructed from the simple, repeating components that had characterized construction in the industrial era, but from complex, CAD/CAM fabricated, nonrepeating elements.3 As inexpensive, digitally controlled production devices have been networked, it has become possible to download designs from distant servers, maybe tweak and customize them as required, then produce them locally.",
        "So increasingly it makes sense to distribute designs through telecommunication networks rather than finished products through transportation networks and to produce customized physical artifacts on demand, wherever and whenever they might be needed.",
        "Fax machines provided an early, modest intimation of this new logic of decentralized, customized, production at a distance.",
        "At the transmission end they begin by harvesting text and images\u2014 the graphic design that is to be reproduced at a distance\u2014from paper sheets.",
        "They encode and send this information electronically, at high speed.",
        "At the reception end, they reinscribe it on new paper sheets.",
        "When you fax a document you don\u2019t actually perform the miracle of teleporting a sheet of printed paper, but the effect is the same.",
        "A good Platonist would know just how to describe the process.",
        "You separate an object\u2019s form from its material, transmit the dematerialized form, and eventually reembody the form with new but indistinguishable material.",
        "You dematerialize, then rematerialize.",
        "You keep the bits constant, but substitute new atoms.",
        "Even more dramatically, since laser printers have become commonplace, vast quantities of textual and graphic material are now stored on servers, downloaded anywhere there is a network connection, and printed out on demand.",
        "The distribution system for printed documents has, in effect, bifurcated; instead of printing documents at a central location then distributing information and paper bonded together, the idea is to distribute blank paper and ink as inexpensive commodities and to distribute information separately via highly efficient electronic channels.",
        "In many contexts, particularly where the numbers of copies are small or the information is frequently updated, the efficiencies of this distribution strategy far outweigh the economies of scale realized through centralized high speed printing.",
        "This has, of course, crucial implications for publishers, book retailers, and libraries.",
        "Ever since the industrial revolution gave us high speed presses, books have been produced in bulk at central factory locations, stored (at high cost) in warehouses, distributed to retailers who store them again on their shelves, and finally delivered to libraries and consumers.",
        "This system makes it expensive and difficult to keep titles in print for long periods and to distribute books effectively to remote corners of the world.",
        "Furthermore, lots of books are distributed to retailers only to remain unsold, eventually to be returned to the publishers and pulped.",
        "Now, however, it is feasible to store books in electronic form on servers rather than in print form in warehouses, to download them on demand to point of sale book machines, and to print and bind them on the spot.4 And the potential of new print technology does not end there.",
        "At MIT\u2019s Media Laboratory, Joe Jacobson and his research group have prototyped the idea of a \"desktop fab.\u201d5 The idea is to print logic chips, electronic tags, MEMS devices, and the like on inexpensive substrates such as paper or plastic using \"ink\u201d consisting of nanometer sized particles.",
        "Instead of purchasing standard electronic components that were produced in billion dollar specialized facilities, you might download and print your own\u2014much as you now download software.",
        "A NEW LOGIC OF PRODUCTION As a result of decentralized, customized, production at a distance, supply networks are destabilized and transformed, and they demand rethinking.",
        "From an economist\u2019s perspective, for example, a chain through a supply network progressively adds value to materials\u2014 going, for example, from water to ice cube, sand to a silicon chip, or electronic components to fully assembled computer.",
        "Traditionally, the sequence has been one of design, component fabrication, assembly, warehousing, retailing, and eventually disposal or recycling.",
        "Now the producer\u2019s crucial assets may be designs residing on servers rather than completed products in warehouses, and these designs may be applied to add value to materials at multiple, decentralized production points of fluid and often indeterminate location, rather than at fixed, centralized industrial sites.",
        "From a designer\u2019s perspective, the process is one of progressively binding design decisions to materials.",
        "At each stage, designers are constrained by the ways in which variables were bound at earlier stages.",
        "Thus if I assemble a design out of Lego blocks, I am constrained by the predefined geometry of my components; if I assemble an electronic system out of standard chips, I am constrained by the earlier decisions of circuit designers; and if I assemble an order for personalized sneakers online, I work within a tightly bounded range of sneaker features and their combinations.6 But we are now moving from early binding of design variables to late binding.",
        "As a designer working with a networked, digitally controlled production device, I can select the design to download and customize it to my circumstances by choosing values for parameters at the very last moment before impressing it upon materials.",
        "It matters little whether the digital master files that increasingly control decentralized production of material and acoustic artifacts are generated by processes of scanning, recording, and otherwise capturing existing physical reality, whether they are constructed directly by means of text, music, or CAD editing software, or whether they are complex hybrids.",
        "In a digitally controlled world, Nelson Goodman\u2019s hitherto telling distinction between autographic and allographic production collapses.",
        "Every artifact has a digital script, score, or plan, and every production process is an automated performance.",
        "Creation of the script, score, or plan may look like composition (taking place in meticulous, step by step fashion, using some sort of editing software) or more like recording a performance\u2014with the operations executed at high speed, using specialized instruments and interfaces.",
        "And this produces a curious new category of art objects.",
        "Under conditions of craft production, art objects are unique.",
        "We value their direct connection to the hand of the artist, and we care about provenance; they possess the quality that Walter Benjamin famously termed \"aura.\u201d7 Under conditions of mechanical reproduction, there is a distinction between an original (an oil painting by Vermeer, for example) and its copies, such as the postcards for sale in the museum store\u2014a mass audience consumes these aura challenged, industrially produced commodities.",
        "But under conditions of materialization on demand from a digital file, there need be no original; new material instances may be produced at any time, and instances may differ widely from one another\u2014for example, by being produced at different scales, at different resolutions, or with different materials.",
        "MUTABILITY, RECOMBINATION, AND NAPSTERIZATION The shift to decentralized, digitally mastered production is inexorably eroding structures of authority that had been sustained by mutually supportive strategies of productizing intellectual and artistic work, industrializing mass production, and legally controlling replication processes.",
        "The debate buzzing around this transformation has mostly been cast in terms of ownership of intellectual property, payment, copying, and reuse rights.8 It has pitted the aggressive lawyers of large entertainment and publishing companies against libraries, academics, and defenders of the public interest in the areas of fair use and unrestricted access.",
        "But maybe even more fundamentally, the debate is also about preserving the stability, identity, and closure of intellectual products versus the possibility of creative transformation and recombination.",
        "If you purchase a CD from a record store, for example, you get the set of performances that the record producer has chosen to bundle together\u2014no more, no less\u2014whether you want them all or not.",
        "But if you rip all your CDs, and store the MP3s on your hard drive, you can group and sequence performances in any way you want.9 And if you download MP3s from Napster or one of its successors, you gain even more freedom.",
        "This breaks down the unity of the CD while preserving the integrity of recorded performances, but the musical strategy of sampling takes the process a step further.",
        "The sampler employs digital editing technology to appropriate fragments of musical material from multiple sources, transform them, and recombine them to produce new works.",
        "This is an innovative and artistically vital practice but, under the usual rules of industrial era copyright, it is treading on dangerous legal ground.",
        "Artists get away with it only so long as the appropriated fragments are not copyrighted by aggressive holders, not overly large, and not too recognizable after transformation.",
        "If their compositions turn out to be profitable enough to make it worthwhile, they are likely to find themselves pursued by IP sharks.",
        "Print publishers, like record companies bundling tracks on CDs, have traditionally grouped texts into issues of magazines and journals and into bound hardback and paperback volumes.",
        "In addition to its efficiencies and pricing advantages, this provided a convenient framework for branding; it was advantageous to have your work come out under the imprint of a well regarded publisher or to have your article published in a prestigious journal in the company of the established intellectual elite.",
        "The photocopier first challenged this strategy by enabling ready reproduction of pages, articles, and chapters, and the recombination of these extracts into new, ad hoc collections such as course readers.",
        "With digital text, the logic of the database replaced that of the printed page.",
        "Publishers of online journals discovered that rigid subdivision of material into \"issues\u201d no longer made much sense.",
        "Large, searchable text databases like LexisNexis aggregated articles from numerous sources and supported retrieval by user specified category, and the World Wide Web cross connected huge structures of text with hyperlinks.",
        "For a century and a half photographers, using the silver based process, have captured complete images with definite spatial and temporal coordinates.",
        "The privileged role of the photographic image as reliable visual evidence has depended upon its wholeness and closure and the possibility of tracing it back to an unambiguous origin point.",
        "But digital cameras now decompose images into finite grids of pixels that may readily be sampled and recombined to produce seamless collages.",
        "Furthermore, digital images\u2014both captured and synthetic\u2014 may be replicated indefinitely and endlessly circulated through the Internet.",
        "Distinctions among visual facts, falsehoods, and fictions are increasingly difficult to construct and sustain.10 From the perspective of architects, Napsterization is the culmination of a long process of mobilizing and recombining design information.",
        "It began with the use of portable templates to facilitate replication of standard shapes and profiles in buildings.",
        "With the emergence of print, architects began to publish descriptions of architectural elements and rules for their combination; great classical treatises, from Palladio\u2019s Four Books to Guadet\u2019s Elements and Theory, disseminated standardized languages of architectural form.11 We are now entering an era in which descriptions of elements and rules are stored on servers as software objects, traded, varied, and recombined electronically, and eventually materialized by means of CAD/CAM production devices.12 If Palladio were alive today, he would be looking to 3D digital modeling and peer to peer distribution technology, not to woodcuts of plans and elevations.",
        "MODULARITY AND PORTABILITY You can trade and recombine MP3 files, digital images, CAD models, and the like because they are modular; that is, they are standard units in consistent format.",
        "(If an MP3 player gets a file that isn\u2019t in this format, it won\u2019t open it.) More technically, the differences among MP3 files are hidden behind a layer of abstraction that allows them to be handled in a uniform way.",
        "Over time, computing environments have evolved increasingly sophisticated layers of abstraction, providing greater modularity, easier reuse, and enhanced capacity to recombine digital fragments into new structures.",
        "In the 1960s, on the batch processing computers of the time, you could assemble Fortran programs by duplicating decks of cards encoding functions and subroutines, then shuffling them into desired sequences; rubber bands, sorting machines, duplicating machines, and cardboard boxes were important aids in this process.",
        "Similarly, data files were decks of cards terminated by punched end of file symbols.",
        "If you wanted to modify a line of code or a data record (to correct a typo, for example) you physically pulled a card and replaced it.",
        "But this was cumbersome, and furthermore, mutually incompatible compilers established strong \"trade barriers\u201d among computing subcultures centered on different machines.",
        "By the 1970s, though, things had become much easier; at the terminals of timesharing mainframe systems, you could use simple filesharing systems, online function and subroutine libraries, and text editors to assemble and run programs (maybe in Lisp) electronically.",
        "Then local area networks, the Arpanet, and the Internet further facilitated sharing, reuse, and recombination of code\u2014and provided fertile ground for development of the collaborative \"hacker\u201d culture.",
        "Meanwhile, programming languages and software engineering practices evolved to support creation of modular, portable, reusable code units rather than huge, monolithic software constructions of the past; in particular, languages like C++ enabled creation of highly modular software \"objects,\u201d development of sharable object libraries, and use of convenient mechanisms, such as inheritance, to facilitate modification and combination of existing objects to produce new objects.",
        "Eventually, as networked computing environments became standard, languages like Java combined the virtues of modularity with easy network distribution and ability to run immediately in just about any computing environment.",
        "At a technical level, there was now little to inhibit global free trade in software modules.",
        "Of course, though, you might still choose to inhibit such trade by deliberately introducing incompatibilities, or to erect security barriers against ill behaved code you wouldn\u2019t want invading your machine.",
        "Modularized, parameterized, mobilized software has enabled several competing production and distribution strategies.",
        "For example, the neo Fordist, industrial strategy\u2014as pursued by Microsoft and other large software firms\u2014emphasizes organized division of labor, accumulation of corporate intellectual property, integration of as many functions as possible into a single, standard, product, closure and protection of that product (the source code is not available to users), branding, and market domination.",
        "By contrast, the open source strategy\u2014most vividly illustrated by the development of the Linux operating system\u2014takes advantage of the creativity and enlightened self interest of user communities to create shared intellectual capital.13 In an open source production environment, source code is made freely available, users extend and modify it as appropriate to their particular needs and priorities, and contribute generally useful extensions and modifications to a common pool.",
        "Most radical of all (and, so far, of least practical impact\u2014though I would not bet against it in the long term) is the evolutionary strategy.",
        "In so called \"simulated evolution,\u201d software modules randomly mutate, they are evaluated by some specified fitness function, and according to their fitness values, they either survive in the common pool or are discarded.14 All of these strategies can work well under the right circumstances, and they can work in various combinations and flavors; the commonality is reliance on modular, malleable, mobile, electronic text as the enabling medium.",
        "These network enabled strategies of decentralized collaging, sampling, searching and exchanging, and open sourcing threaten established corporate approaches to creating, pricing, marketing, and protecting information products.",
        "Not surprisingly then, corporate interests have often resisted and even attempted to criminalize them.15 Disney, Time Warner, Microsoft, and Reed Elsevier would have it that the value of digital information derives from easy distribution and wide consumer access to completed, packaged, impregnably encrypted and copyrighted intellectual products.",
        "But far greater societal value resides in its endless capacity for fluid adaptation, transformation, and recombination, within communities of interest, to produce new and unexpected outcomes.",
        "If publishers and record companies succeed in enforcing continuation of outdated, industrial age norms and conventions into the network era, many of the advantages of free flowing, readily recombinable digital information will be lost.",
        "The cultural cost will be enormous.",
        "This applies not only to pure information products, but also to material products formed through the application of information.",
        "The binding of form to materials has been loosened.",
        "We are entering an era in which batches of material may readily inhabit different forms, and digitally specified forms may inhabit different materials.",
        "In sum, we have to rethink Manufacturing 101 and reconsider strategies for controlling the means of production.",
        "We may still be a long way from the superhero nano ring or the future wittily extrapolated in Neal Stephenson\u2019s The Diamond Age \u2014a world in which every household has \"the feed,\u201d a nanopipeline that supplies atoms to matter compilers that produce whatever goods you need on demand\u2014but conditions have fundamentally changed.16 What now matters most is not having an inventory of valuable things in your possession, nor even the machinery needed to produce such an inventory, but access to the invisible, immaterial, digital specifications.",
        "It is all very Platonic, in a way; digitally encoded ideas exist somewhere in cyberspace, and physical artifacts are their imperfect, material realizations.",
        "9 POST SEDENTARY SPACE Antonello da Messina\u2019s famous picture of Saint Jerome in his study shows how the attachment of atoms, in the most literal way, adds inertia to information.1 It depicts the scholar surrounded and encumbered by his heavyweight personal information environment; he pores over a manuscript on the inclined desk before him, and his precious accumulation of books, papers, and writing instruments is gathered around, within the enclosure of his room.",
        "It is a tightly bounded assemblage of physical materials at a particular location.",
        "If he wants to keep it at hand, rather than rely upon fallible memory, its bulk and mass tightly tether him to that particular place.",
        "Dilbert wasn\u2019t so different.",
        "Like most office workers of the 1980s and 1990s, he occupied a cube containing a PC.2 His information environment was more digital than paper\u2014some of it residing on his local disk, and some of it on distant servers.",
        "Although he did not need physical proximity to the servers, he still had to be near the delivery point.",
        "He was as tied to his computer as Saint Jerome had been to his bookshelves.",
        "Furthermore, his telephone was physically attached to the cubicle; you could only call him when he was in.",
        "In other words, desktop computers, telephones, and wired networks provided fixed points of presence.",
        "These favored points were like oases in a digital information desert; they were powerful attractors of human presence and activity.",
        "The cubicle farms of the era were grids of such points.",
        "As networks became faster and more sophisticated, and as more and more information moved from local storage to servers, it ceased to matter which cubicle Dilbert occupied.",
        "He could log in from wherever he happened to be in the building, and he could have his calls electronically redirected.",
        "This was good for the boss, who could make more efficient use of his stock of cubicle space by shuffling cubicle dwellers around at will, but it did not help Dilbert\u2019s quality of life.",
        "He still had to be at some point of presence, and the new cube to cube mobility gave him even less opportunity to personalize his surroundings.",
        "But wireless connections and portable access devices create continuous fields of presence that may extend throughout buildings, outdoors, and into public space as well as private.",
        "This has profound implications for the locations and spatial distributions of all human activities that depend, in some way, upon access to information.",
        "FIELDS OF PRESENCE By selectively loosening place to place contiguity requirements, wired networks produced fragmentation and recombination of familiar building types and urban patterns.3 For example, the local bank or branch bank largely disappeared in the early digital era; it was replaced by more decentralized access points distributed throughout the city\u2014 that is, ATM machines and electronic home banking on desktop computers, combined with centralized back office facilities and call centers that provided economies of scale.",
        "Similarly, by selectively loosening person to place contiguity requirements, wireless networks and portable devices have created an additional degree of spatial indeterminacy; you can now electronically \"home\u201d bank from a wireless laptop, and if you can rely upon credit cards, debit cards, or some form of electronic cash, you never need to go looking for an ATM location.",
        "From the customer\u2019s perspective, banking no longer has any particular place in the city.",
        "In the short lived dot com era, Amazon and other online retailers fragmented and recombined retail functions and provided an alternative to stores and malls; you would order goods online, and they would be delivered from a warehouse to your home or office.",
        "Thus the retail store functions of advertising and enticement, browsing, and completing the sale transaction were fragmented and dispersed, while the functions of storage and dispatch of stock were highly centralized at monster box (often national) distribution centers that offered economies of scale, and back office functions\u2014supported by e commerce technology\u2014could be located just about anywhere.",
        "This turned out to work well for compact, high value items like books and electronics, but for dog food, delivery costs were a killer.",
        "Now, wireless fields of presence are beginning to provide yet another alternative\u2014one that returns advantage to highly differentiated, place based retailers.",
        "Location based advertising, maybe combined with electronic urban navigation, can tell you the nearest point of availability of some specialized thing that you want\u2014such as a funghi porcini risotto at a good Italian restaurant\u2014and guide you to it.",
        "If you think of shopping as a search for scarce or specialized (maybe unique) things that are to be found at particular locations in a city, then wirelessly delivered, dynamically updated, location specific information can greatly increase the efficiency of that search.",
        "Location based advertising can also guide you to scarce commodities available at dynamically varying locations, such as urban parking spaces and unoccupied machines in laundry rooms.",
        "This can be integrated with sensor networks; you can embed inexpensive, carsensing devices in parking stalls, and use monitors in washers and dryers.",
        "For example, eSuds has networked washers and dryers in college dorms; when machines are available, and when they have completed their cycles, they send out email and pager messages.",
        "Some activities, such as stock trading and gambling on horse races, depend upon highly time sensitive information.",
        "Before highspeed telecommunication, this meant that you had to be right at the site of production of that information\u2014the stock exchange floor or the racetrack, for example.",
        "If you were distant, you might still participate, but you would be disadvantaged by information transmission delays; conversely, as James Joyce\u2019s get rich quick, wireless aided scheme for betting on the English races illustrated, you might gain advantage by shortening those delays.",
        "With telecommunication, and electronic information and transaction services, the action began to shift to distributed points of presence; we saw the decline (and sometimes disappearance) of centralized exchanges and clusters of bookies on the rails, accompanied by the rise of electronic trading floors, day trading at PCs, and off track betting shops.",
        "Today, even those distributed sites are no longer technically necessary\u2014though they may sometimes be preserved by regulators who want to confine activities to particular locations; trading and gambling can readily shift to wireless, portable devices.",
        "Yet other activities have begun to depend upon clandestine, wirelessly distributed information and indeterminate locations.",
        "Where prostitution is legal (or at least tolerated), for example, brothels and red light districts can be at fixed, well known, maybe even advertised locations; where it is frowned upon, and telecommunication is not readily available, you get mobile streetwalkers; and where a wired telephone network is available, you get call girl operations\u2014effectively mobilizing and distributing the actual sites of service but leaving the headquarters vulnerable to raids.",
        "But where clients, pimps, and sex workers have access to pagers, cellphones, and instant messaging, locations are temporary, mobile, and indeterminate.",
        "It becomes much harder to regulate the sex industry\u2014and to protect workers.",
        "Drug dealers have also learned the advantages of continuous fields of presence.",
        "Where they can rely sufficiently upon fortification, intimidation, and paying off the cops, they can distribute from crack houses.",
        "If a neighborhood has plenty of public telephones, they can arrange more dispersed transactions through those\u2014but the authorities may stake out or simply remove telephones.",
        "When they have pagers and cellphones, though, dealers can stay highly mobile, take orders wherever they happen to be, and deliver at ad hoc locations\u2014 dropping rocks from an SUV and using foot action for ziplock baggies of weed.",
        "In response, during the 1990s many schools banned wireless electronic devices.4 Pornographers, as they always managed with new technology, have been particularly fast on their feet.",
        "Photography and print facilitated the production of pornography but generated a distribution problem; the obvious, site specific option of a porn store was vulnerable to busts and shakedowns, might embarrass the customers, and might be resisted by neighbors.",
        "Pornographers quickly turned to the smut magazine format, the mail, and plain brown wrappers, but they still had to contend with mail regulators and customs officials.",
        "(Even today, don\u2019t try smuggling skin pix into Saudi.) They swiftly took advantage of the Internet, offshore servers, encryption, and anonymous remailers, but the authorities immediately countered by raiding server locations and looking for downloaded nasties on PC hard drives.",
        "Now it is possible to create highly redundant, decentralized, peer to peer porn networks (that is, to Napsterize smut), and to distribute to wireless devices at mobile locations.",
        "As broadband wireless develops, delivery of high resolution pornographic images and videos (maybe captured live by wireless camera/transmitters) will undoubtedly be a killer app.",
        "Skeptics about wireless networks like to emphasize that wireless merely provides the last link in a telecommunication infrastructure that is, in fact, mostly wired.",
        "Furthermore, it is a relatively unreliable and inefficient link.",
        "They are right, but they completely miss the point.",
        "As these examples illustrate, for good or ill, continuous fields of presence provided by wireless networks can fundamentally alter patterns of resource availability and space use.",
        "REMOBILIZING SERVICES The simplest of transportation networks allowed itinerant poets and scholars to visit communities and doctors to make house calls.",
        "However, as educational and medical services increasingly depended upon accumulations of specialized equipment, supplies, and expertise, they were centralized at large scale, purpose built facilities\u2014particu larly modern schools, university campuses, and hospitals.",
        "Sometimes students and patients became long term inmates of these facilities, sometimes they visited them on regular schedules (school days and school hours), sometimes they went by appointment, and sometimes they made emergency visits\u2014but always they had to remove themselves from the contexts of their communities and enter particularized environments to access the services they needed.",
        "The ivory tower and the magic mountain came to symbolize this system\u2019s reliance upon separation, the invigilated exam room and the Nurse Ratchet its engagement with structures of control.",
        "Throughout the twentieth century, educational and medical complexes (sometimes combined) grew and coevolved with urban networks.",
        "Sometimes they were simply concentrations of specialized facilities within the urban fabric, as at University College London or New York University, and sometimes they were discrete, clearly bounded, even walled and gated campuses.",
        "Increasingly extensive transportation networks enabled them to serve larger populations, provided their personnel with access to housing, and encouraged them to take advantage of scale to develop specializations.",
        "They evolved into major urban elements and important nodes in transportation networks.",
        "The UCLA campus, at the edge of the Los Angeles basin, may be the mature masterpiece of the genre; there is a pretty piazza at the center, the pavilions of the arts and humanities occupy the green and hilly northern end, big footprint medical and engineering buildings cluster at the more urban southern end, and the perimeter is defined by a ring road studded with huge parking structures and card key access points.",
        "Daily commuters converge on campus from throughout the basin, the San Fernando Valley to the north, and Orange County to the south.",
        "The Arpanet\u2014which, fittingly enough, first took root at UCLA\u2014initiated a process of integrating these institutional nodes into even larger scale networks.",
        "It was initially conceived (or at least justified) as a mechanism for sharing expensive computer resources among campuses and research centers; maps of early Arpanet growth show rapid proliferation of campus to campus links.",
        "Over time, computers got cheaper, campus computer centers (powerful political entities in the 1960s and 1970s) fragmented into campus LANs such as MIT\u2019s Athena network, and the Arpanet evolved into the Internet.",
        "Long before the dot com boom of the late 1990s, the dot edu domain was linking campus offices, laboratories, and dorm rooms globally.",
        "Furthermore, the policy on many campuses was to pay interconnection costs centrally rather than to charge individual users, so the Internet seemed like a resource that could be used freely.",
        "At the macro scale, during the 1980s and 1990s, wired interconnections encouraged division of labor among campuses, increasingly ambitious and long distance campus to campus collaborations, and formation of geographically distributed professional communities.",
        "Much as designers of the Arpanet had focused on long distance sharing of computational resources, college, university, and medical center administrators became increasingly interested in the possibility of sharing specialized human resources through classrooms and lecture halls equipped for videoconferencing, telemedicine suites, and Web sites.",
        "At the micro scale, though, wired networks tied teachers and students to fixed points of presence\u2014often to the detriment of face to face community; they tended to keep faculty members (like Dilbert) in their offices and students in wired dormitory rooms.",
        "As local and distributed communities competed for mindshare, local began to lose ground; professors and medical specialists often discovered that they had more valuable and satisfying exchanges with colleagues on the far side of the world than with those just down the hall.",
        "Meanwhile, the Internet had expanded far beyond its ancestral heartland in academia\u2014making not only on campus sites, but also homes and offices generally, potential delivery points for remote education and telemedicine services.",
        "In their most elementary form, remote service sites simply pumped out information that might otherwise have been delivered through print, lectures, or face to face consultations\u2014maybe personalized according to the stored needs profiles of clients.",
        "With higher bandwidth and more sophisticated software, these sites could efficiently provide interactions that approximated face to face; you might take a test online from the comfort of your home, or if you lived in a remote community, you might get a reasonably good medical examination through videoconferencing.",
        "And with embedded, networked sensors and intelligence, remote sites might perform highly specialized functions that, traditionally, had only been available at central facilities.",
        "Homes, for example, could become sophisticated medical monitoring and data collection nodes.",
        "Finally, wireless networks superimposed continuous fields of service presence onto this pattern of major and minor points of presence.",
        "In particular, the introduction of campus wireless networks in the early 2000s, combined with portable wireless devices and the growth in electronic distribution of educational material, quickly began to break down the rigid person to place connections that had hitherto characterized campus life; students did not need to be at fixed network drops or computer clusters to download or electronically interact, they did not have to go to the library to pick up texts, they no longer required desks or carrels to write, and they did not need to show up in person for videocast lectures.5 They could form ad hoc discussion and collaboration clusters, wherever and whenever they wanted, without losing access to online resources or contact with their geographically extended communities.",
        "The classically minded recalled that the Greek philosophers did not have offices and classrooms elaborately organized into departments and schools; they strolled freely through the groves and stoas of academe\u2014but, as Plato vividly emphasized, they had to rely upon their memories.",
        "Now, while a scholar stands in line for a sandwich, she can wirelessly search the TLG for a passage from Plato to clinch an argument with her lunch companion.",
        "As wireless education serves the mind, wireless medical care attends to the body\u2014and the effects of the resulting service continuity are, potentially, even more dramatic.",
        "When monitoring and emergency summoning devices began to migrate from the hospital to the networked home, continuity of service could be increased, and separation of patients from their families and communities could be decreased.",
        "Now further migration, to wearable and implanted, wirelessly connected devices, is taking that process a step further.",
        "And more active care, through wirelessly operated implants and medication delivery devices, is an obvious possibility.6 All this is not so different from continuously monitoring the conditions and dynamically responding to the biological needs of deep sea divers or astronauts\u2014 but without the cumbersome suits and the tethers back to the ships.",
        "Marketers of goods and services can potentially make use of wireless, context aware devices to monitor customer needs continuously and respond to them appropriately, thus gaining a competitive advan tage.7 If you are in a theater, for example, your cellphone might discreetly vibrate in your pocket instead of ringing loudly and disturbing your neighbors.",
        "If you are on foot and it\u2019s raining, you might get prompted with the telephone number of the local taxi service and locations of nearby establishments selling umbrellas.",
        "Increasingly, businesses will try to be wirelessly present and responsive wherever, whenever, and however their customers need them\u2014but this will, of course, depend upon the willingness of their customers to give up some privacy in order to gain personalized, contextualized service.",
        "The advantages of wireless fields of presence are accompanied by subtle and not so subtle challenges to the regime of separation and control that has long been built into schools, campuses, and medical facilities.",
        "Schoolteachers were among the first to notice this, as kids equipped with wireless devices began to order pizzas in class, pass SMS notes, and clandestinely circulate answers to test questions.",
        "Retailers began to worry that customers in their stores might scan the barcodes on products and wirelessly search for competitors with better prices.",
        "Professors delivering lectures began to wonder if they had the undivided attention of students crouched over their wireless laptops and were surprised in seminars as their interlocutors silently downloaded salient information to interject into the discussion.",
        "The immediate authoritarian response, of course, was to try to banish personal wireless devices\u2014but this was doomed to failure.",
        "When the dust settled, few would willingly give up the benefits of continuous connection.",
        "RESTRUCTURING LIVE/WORK Before the emergence of large scale networks, dwellings and workplaces were often intermingled in fine grained spatial patterns.",
        "Shepherds slept with their flocks, peasants lived among their fields, craft specialists both lived and worked in urban professional quarters, and merchants resided above their shops.",
        "But as Engels so vividly observed in Manchester, industrial cities changed that.",
        "Factory owners provided work space, the urban proleteriat provided labor, and the workers lived outside the factory gates.",
        "The separation of noisy, polluted industrial zones from leafy garden suburbs, and their linkage by commuter transportation networks, became one of the great triumphs of enlightened urban planning.",
        "In a parallel development, telegraph and telephone networks enabled the spatial separation of management from industrial production and allowed managers and clerical workers to cluster with others of their kind in downtown central business districts.",
        "The focusing of transportation networks on these centers, and the concentration of network infrastructure there, drove up land values and encouraged high density development.",
        "Steel, concrete, glass, and electrically powered systems provided the means, and the high rise office tower emerged in response to these conditions; it became the characteristic business workplace of the twentieth century.",
        "There were numerous variations on the theme of the coarsegrained industrial city, with its separated industrial, commercial, and residential zones linked by commuter transportation networks.",
        "You might get suburban office parks with parking lots instead of high density, transit serviced cores, secondary and tertiary centers, clusters of towers at edge city locations, and vast, multicentered urban regions such as that of Los Angeles.",
        "But in major cities the principle of spatial separation into discrete zones, combined with that of commuter linkage among zones, obtained with remarkable consistency throughout the twentieth century.",
        "As the capabilities of wired telecommunication networks developed and their service areas expanded, though, there was increasing speculation that telecommunication might substitute for travel within this sort of urban structure.8 (If Dilbert was isolated in his cubicle, with his computer and his telephone, it might not much matter where that cubicle actually was.) One version of this idea was the concept of home telecommuting; the cubicle might become a study in a suburban house.9 Another was that of the electronic cottage (Landor\u2019s Cottage with email); if you no longer had to commute to work, you might move your residence out beyond suburbia to a distant recreational or scenic area.",
        "Yet another version of the idea focused upon access to rural labor markets; if your business was in an expensive urban area where prospective employees could not afford to live, you might try to recruit a telecommuter workforce from less expensive rural areas.",
        "And another, again, was motivated by urban workspace costs; employers realized that they could save on rent by relocating employees to less expensive, suburban satellite locations instead of keeping them all at expensive downtown sites, with the added advantage that employees could save on commute time and costs.",
        "But these strategies merely substituted one fixed workplace for another, and forced a tradeoff between them.",
        "As a result, they met with mixed success.",
        "There have been some interesting examples of live/work televillages in attractive locations, such as Richard Rogers\u2019s design for ParcBIT in the Balearic Islands,10 and Giancarlo De Carlo\u2019s rehabilitation of the Ligurian mountain village of Colletta di Castelbianco,11 and electronically serviced live/work has certainly played a role in the revitalization of urban areas such as Manhattan\u2019s SoHo, San Francisco\u2019s SoMa, and Singapore\u2019s China Square.",
        "Telecommuting has also proved to be crucial to rapid disaster recovery in the wake of events such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Southern California, and the September 11 attack on New York, which destroyed workplaces and disrupted commuter travel.",
        "For example, several thousand Lehman Brothers employees telecommuted in the weeks following September 11, while replacement work space was being found for them.",
        "However, by the early 2000s, it seemed clear that full time telecommuting was not going to take off on a large scale.",
        "The reason is simply that the tradeoffs don\u2019t necessarily look attractive unless there are some particularly compelling lifestyle, social, or economic motivations to consider.",
        "You might appreciate not having to commute, but you might also miss the companionship of coworkers.",
        "You might value the comforts of home, but you might also want opportunities to get out of the house.",
        "You might enjoy the view from your mountain hideaway, but you might discover that losing visibility at headquarters was a career disadvantage.",
        "You might like the flexible hours and childcare opportunities afforded by working at home, but you might realize that the home no longer served as a refuge from work.",
        "You might save on travel costs but incur the additional rent and operating costs of a home office.",
        "The workplace could fragment, and the home and the workplace could recombine\u2014reinstating a preindustrial pattern in the postindustrial era\u2014but this was not always and unambiguously to the good.",
        "By contrast, wireless networks, portable electronic devices, and online work environments now allow information workers to move freely from location to location as needs, desires, and circumstances demand.",
        "By the early 2000s, many workers (and their employers) had discovered that they just needed a cellphone and a laptop to operate effectively at their nominal workplaces, on commuter trains, in airplane seats and airport lounges, in hotel rooms, at the sites of clients and collaborators, at home, and on vacation.",
        "Anyplace was now a potential workplace.",
        "And this condition would only intensify as the technology of nomadics developed and proliferated.",
        "So the emerging, characteristic pattern of twenty first century work is not that of telecommuting, as many futurists had once confidently predicted; it is that of the mobile worker who appropriates multiple, diverse sites as workplaces.12 As architects are rapidly discovering, this breaks down rigid functional distinctions among specialized spaces, and makes provision for varied and sometimes unpredictable functions increasingly critical; a home must serve as an occasional workplace, a hotel room must also be an office, a cafe table must accommodate laptops, and a workplace must adapt to more complex and dynamic patterns of use.",
        "Special places, with particularly desirable qualities, become powerful attractors when traditional person to workplace linkages are loosened; if you have your wireless connections, a seat under a tree in spring beats an interior office cubicle.",
        "And electronically arranged, ad hoc meeting places\u2014where you can most conveniently form the human clusters you need at a particular moment, while remaining in wireless contact\u2014dominate the fixed locations and inflexible schedules that had once been necessary to enable interaction and coordination.",
        "HERTZIAN PUBLIC SPACE Public spaces have traditionally worked best at nodes in transportation networks.",
        "The central crossroad is typically the focus of rural village life, and in larger settlements this crossroad often grows into a village green, a piazza, or a town square.",
        "Still more extensive cities\u2014 among them Rome, Georgian London, Haussmann\u2019s Paris, and Cerda\u2019s Barcelona\u2014have frequently been organized around multiple public spaces embedded in networks of streets and avenues.",
        "These spaces become even more effective when they superimpose nodes of different networks.",
        "The village crossroad, for example, may not only play a role in local pedestrian circulation, it may also serve as a stop in a regional bus transportation network and the site of a public telephone box.",
        "A piazza may be activated by a well or fountain\u2014that is, a public node in a water supply network.",
        "And multiple transportation networks may converge, as at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay, where ferries, trains, buses, taxis, and urban pedestrians come together at a bustling, cafe lined interchange and meeting point.",
        "In many contexts, wired telecommunication networks have both taken advantage of the activity generated by this superimposition and added an important component to it.",
        "Central intersections and squares were natural sites for post and telegraph offices, and before private telephones were common and toll calls were inexpensive, these often expanded to provide banks of booths for long distance phone service.",
        "Similarly, in the early Internet era, before network connections had become commonplace and computers had dropped to insignificant cost relative to income levels (a shift still under way in developing countries and areas), networked computer clusters emerged as new foci of public spaces\u2014much like the traditional village well, but supplying a different type of scarce resource.",
        "At MIT, for example, Athena clusters unexpectedly developed into important meeting and socializing points.",
        "Public libraries also got connected and introduced computer clusters.",
        "Then, as the necessary infrastructure spread throughout urban areas, Internet cafes began to take root.",
        "It was not surprising that, when telecommunications infrastructure began to return to war torn Afghanistan in 2002, one of the first points of Internet availability was an Internet cafe in the basement of Kabul\u2019s Intercontinental Hotel.",
        "The hard core Internet cafe, particularly in the developing world, was nothing more than a low rent, fluorescently lit space jammed with as many computers as possible.",
        "In upscale versions, there was more space, some effort to create a pleasant ambience, and an overlay of the electronic action onto more traditional cafe functions; tables simultaneously accommodated (not always with complete success) food, drink, keyboards, and screens.",
        "Those that went for the fashionable crowd exploited the pervasive electronics to intensify the pleasures of seeing and being seen.",
        "New York\u2019s Remote Lounge, for example, provided cameras above each table to multicast to other tables\u2014and, of course, to a Web site.13 And as public screens became larger and more vivid, their role in creating outdoor spectacle grew\u2014 a gradual shift from cafe to carnival.",
        "Fields of LEDs began to take over and transform the roles of the movie poster, the theater marquee, the billboard, the cornice inscription, and even the entire urban facade.",
        "Shameless old Times Square, which had long been in the spectacle business, completed its rake\u2019s progress from a space demurely defined by traditional architectural elements, to one dominated by print and paint, then the glitter of lightbulb and neon, to programmed LED pixels; visitors encountered an retina jangling spatial collage of animated graphics, electronic stock and news tickers, television programming (with closed captions instead of sound), reflexive imagery (New Year\u2019s Eve crowds watching video images of themselves), and tourists getting their fifteen seconds of big screen fame on Broadway.",
        "Just as the social role of the village well began to fade with the introduction of domestic piped water supply, though, so did that of the public point of network presence as domestic space got wired and computers got cheaper.",
        "If you had a networked computer at home, you didn\u2019t need an Internet cafe, and the point of presence that really mattered to you was the switching node that connected your domestic line (the \"last mile\u201d of the network) to your service provider.14 Public access points hung on longer in specialized contexts\u2014where they provided significant technological advantage (in particular, faster and more reliable connection), as in India, where infrastructure is sparse and often unreliable and private connection remained beyond the reach of many, in China, where Internet cafes also served as connections to a wider world and rallying points for the intelligentsia, and in Korea,15 where PC baangs allowed kids to escape from crowded domestic space and strict parental supervision and had a particular cultural resonance in the land of consumer electronic gadgets\u2014but by the early 2000s it was clear that they would eventually shrink to niche roles at best.",
        "They would go the way of other hopeful space mutations, such as the telegraph station and the drive in movie theater, which had emerged in response to particular technological conditions and were left behind by further technological change.",
        "Meanwhile, continuous fields of network presence had begun to blanket public spaces.",
        "This began with cellular technology, which brought phones out of seclusion like bees from a hive and rapidly transformed public behavior and space use\u2014most obviously by inserting the essentially private activity of phone conversation into space governed by the conventions of public conduct.",
        "This created frictions, which had to be resolved by the development of new rules of etiquette.",
        "Miss Manners had her work cut out for her: continuous phone accessibility was part of the point, but this produced rings at inappropriate times and places.",
        "You might call from a public place to avoid being overheard at home or in the office, but you might end up annoying strangers with your chatter; you might be so engrossed in your private conversation that you lost track of your immediate surroundings and walked into someone; your phone might inconveniently ring while you were in company, forcing you to find a quick and graceful way to excuse yourself; and, if you couldn\u2019t help overhearing an embarrassing private conversation, you had to avert your eyes and compose your face.",
        "A more profound outcome was the new capacity of mobile urbanites, at unknown locations, to arrange ad hoc meeting places.16 In the past, meetings had depended upon explicit prearrangement (leaving you at a loss if, for some reason, your party didn\u2019t show up as expected), upon random encounter, and upon standard meeting places and regular schedules that increased the probability of random encounter.",
        "Italian piazzas, for example, had traditionally depended for their social efficacy upon their central locations and ingrained conventions of showing up there at established times; now, Italians simply call one another and arrange meetings on the fly.",
        "Piazzas still look the same and still work superbly as public space, but their patterns of use have become far more flexible.",
        "In dangerous urban contexts, such as the conflict ridden cities of the Middle East, continuous cellphone communication has become crucial for tracking and intelligence.",
        "Parents use cellphones to keep in contact with their mobile children, to check up on them when something happens, and to get up to date reports on current conditions.",
        "In contested contexts, as when cities experience street demonstrations, cellphones play an equally crucial coordination role; swarms of mobile, wirelessly connected and coordinated demonstrators contend with similarly equipped and coordinated squads of police.",
        "And, in less tense situations, the same sorts of strategies drive the game of cellphone coordinated celebrity spotting.",
        "With the emergence of 802.11 wireless networks in the early 2000s, a new field of functional possibility superimposed itself on public space.",
        "This hub and card technology provided convenient connectivity for wireless laptops, and enthusiasts set about creating public wireless hotspots.",
        "These first emerged in semipublic spaces\u2014such as cafes, bars, lobbies, waiting rooms, and airport lounges\u2014which suddenly became much more useful as ad hoc workplaces and online interaction points; instead of reading a newspaper, you could download your email or surf the Web.",
        "(If you wanted privacy, you learned to take the seat against the wall, and keep the back of your screen to the public.) Then hotspots migrated outdoors.",
        "Midtown Manhattan\u2019s Bryant Park was one of the first outdoor public places to provide for 802.11 surfing under the trees and email from a park bench.",
        "A latter day Manet might paint laptop users on the grass.",
        "In general, as these transformations of public space illustrate, there is a strong relationship between prevailing network structure and the distribution of activities over public and private places.",
        "Where essential urban networks have relatively few access points, as with public transportation and water supply networks, the access points are often in public places, attract activity to those places, and thus strengthen their roles as meeting and interaction points.",
        "When networks become more ramified\u2014as with domestic water supply and sewer, automobile transportation, electrical, and communication net works\u2014they tend to decentralize functions and move them into private spaces\u2014the public bathhouse gives way to the private bathroom, the public theater to the private home entertainment center.",
        "And where networks go wireless, they mobilize activities that had been tied to fixed locations and open up ways of reactivating urban public space; the home entertainment center reemerges as the Walkman, the home telephone as the cellphone, and the home computer as the laptop.",
        "VIRTUAL CAMPFIRES In traditional nomadic societies, regularly rekindled campfires provided mobile focal points for social life.",
        "With urbanization, social life became more commonly focused by fixed attractions\u2014village wells, domestic hearths, and computer network drops.",
        "In the mobile wireless era, a third alternative has emerged; we can use our portable communication devices to construct meeting points and gathering places on the fly\u2014places that may only be known within particular, electronically linked groups, and which may only play such roles for fleeting moments.",
        "10 AGAINST PROGRAM As continuous fields of presence are overlaid on architectural and urban space, the ancient distinction between settlers and nomads\u2014 long the bedrock of our thinking about cities\u2014is eroding in subtle but important ways.",
        "In the emerging wireless era, our buildings and urban environments need fewer specialized spaces built around sites of accumulation and resource availability and more versatile, hospitable, accommodating spaces that simply attract occupation and can serve diverse purposes as required.",
        "A cafe table can serve as a library reading room.",
        "A quiet place under a tree can become a design studio.",
        "A subway car can become a place for watching movies.",
        "ELECTRONOMADIC SPATIAL PRACTICES The relationships of mobile bodies to sedentary structures have loosened and destabilized; inhabitation is less about doing what some designer or manager explicitly intended in a space and more about imaginative, ad hoc appropriation for unanticipated purposes.",
        "We are becoming less like Saint Jerome, immobilized in his study among his accumulated possessions, less like Dilbert stuck at his computer in his cubicle, and more like cyborg foragers navigating through electronically mediated resource fields.",
        "We are relying less upon things (or people) being at fixed locations, or available on regular schedules, and more upon electronic tracking and navigation to locate what we want and take us to it.",
        "Our mental maps of buildings and cities are becoming less static records of fixed features and more dynamic representations of current conditions.",
        "This condition, understood in the most optimistic way, offers liberation from the rigidities and interdictions of the predefined program and the zone\u2014a release from ways of using spaces produced and enforced by dominant social orders.1 It opens up the possibility of new, as yet unimagined spatial practices, and the opportunity (in the words of Michel de Certeau) \"to rediscover, within an electroni cized and computerized megalopolis, the \u2018art\u2019 of the hunters and rural folk of earlier days.\u201d2 Or, if you don\u2019t like the pseudo primitivism of this formulation, you might imagine rediscovering Baudelaire\u2019s flanerie,3 situationist \"drift,\u201d4 or whatever it was that Deleuze and Guattari were recommending in A Thousand Plateaus.5 Conversely, for those who would exert state or corporate power, it offers anonymity and the possibility of avoiding resistance.",
        "Today, such power may flow as easily from a fluidly and ambiguously located constellation of cellphones as it traditionally has from a throne room in a palace, a boardroom in a corporate headquarters, or a courtroom in a national capital.",
        "As resistance movements have quickly realized, sites for effective confrontation of power are becoming harder to iden tify.6 How do you determine a time and locate a place for resistance? Where do you demonstrate? What do you occupy? The evolution of taxi fleets has dramatized these transformations in the use and control of space.",
        "In the past, where urban densities were too low for drivers to rely upon customers hailing them in the street, centralized wireless dispatchers fielded telephone calls and assigned jobs.",
        "Now cabbies carry cellphones as well, and rely upon their mobile, distributed, peer to peer networks for intelligence about traffic conditions and tips about concentrations of potential customers.",
        "In more advanced systems, customers make location coded cellphone calls, cabs have GPS navigation systems, and software assigns jobs based upon proximity.",
        "There is a shift from centralized coordination and control to electronically mediated swarming.",
        "While their elders were trying to figure all this out, kids\u2014 employing the short text messaging capabilities of cellphones\u2014imagi natively pioneered the new spatial tactics of ad hoc occupation and electronic appropriation.",
        "They quickly learned to fan out through city streets in fluid packs, electronically negotiating and specifying sites for assignations, raves, and street demonstrations.",
        "Those who wanted to repress these practices soon came up with the countermeasure (at least for the moment)\u2014have the cops confiscate the phones.",
        "And the kids, in response, are discovering how to immobilize opponents by unleashing worms and viruses that clog channels of communication.",
        "Control of space\u2014particularly in real time\u2014now requires control of the airwaves.",
        "In many ways, the dynamic ebbs and flows of the basketball court and the soccer field provide compelling models for these new spatial practices.",
        "The players are mobile, autonomous actors, but they are in constant visual and auditory communication with one another, and they adjust their actions in response to evolving situations.",
        "Over larger chunks of terrain, the wirelessly communicating units of a military operation act in similarly coordinated fashion.",
        "Now, spatially dispersed yet coordinated, fluid collections of wirelessly interconnecting individuals\u2014perhaps assembled, from the beginning, in cyberspace rather than at any physical location\u2014are becoming a crucial fact of urban life.",
        "They constitute a new category of human assemblage\u2014 one to add to our traditional conceptions of the gathering, the throng, the crowd, the masses, the mob, the cadre, the cell, the ensemble, the battalion, and the team.7 The connected masses also create problems of differential mobility.",
        "Traditional nomads understood these problems well and often dealt with them brutally; they left behind the aged, infirm, and otherwise immobilized.",

        "Financial firms that had their premises destroyed in the World Trade Center attacks could instantly activate backup sites and send their employees into telecommuter mode, but restaurants and other small establishments that serviced those firms in Lower Manhattan were stuck at their sites, lost clientele, and suffered disproportionately badly.",

        "THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ARCHITECTURAL PROGRAM For architects, continuous fields of presence and the destabilization of person to place relationships demand some radical rethinking of the fundamentals.",
        "The standard procedure of twentieth century modernism was to start by distinguishing and separating functions\u2014the better to optimize spaces for particular functions and to announce those functions visually.",
        "(Communication engineers might think of it as space division multiplexing of activities.) At an urban scale, housing areas were to be distinguished from industrial and commercial zones.",
        "At building scale, there were to be specialized spaces, with associated equipment, for the activities that were to be accommodated.",
        "And the physical fabric of a building was to be articulated function ally\u2014for example, by separating the supporting and enclosing functions of a wall by substituting columns for support and a nonbearing curtain wall for enclosure.",
        "But this strategy makes little sense when wireless electronic devices can support many different activities at a single location or the same activity at many different locations, and when running different software can radically alter the functions provided by a device without changing its form at all.",
        "Time division multiplexing of activities is starting to look smarter than space division.",
        "The key instrument of the traditional spatial organization strategy was the written architectural program \u2014a detailed list of required spaces, specifying floor areas, technical requirements, and adjacency needs.8 Built space made the provisions of the program concrete, and construction bureaucrats compared plans to checklists just to make sure.",
        "But the architecture of the twenty first century can (if we choose to take the opportunity) be far less about responding to such rigid programs and much more about creating flexible, diverse, humane habitats for electronically supported nomadic occupation.",
        "It can be an architecture not of stable routines and spatial patterns, but, as Michael Batty has suggested, of continually reconfiguring clusters of spatial events characterized by their duration, intensity, volatility, and location.9 This architecture will pursue the benefits of loose binding.",
        "Consider these in the context of office space, for example.",
        "When office workers have cubicles filled with files and bookshelves, it is relatively difficult and expensive to move them around; churn takes time and costs money, so managers have traditionally tried to minimize it\u2014 with the result that organizations are slow to adapt to change, and workers are often left in locations that no longer serve them well.",
        "But if the personal information environments of office workers automatically and instantaneously follow them around, they can sit down and work anywhere.",
        "The cost of regrouping to meet new needs drops almost to zero.",
        "You can also look at this from a long term space management perspective.",
        "When organizations move into new buildings, they usually have carefully worked out space plans.",
        "Then, over time, they make incremental changes in response to emerging demands, with the result that the space becomes fragmented and inefficient, much as the disk space does on your computer.",
        "Defragmentation is difficult and expensive when move costs are high, but it is easy when move costs become negligible.",
        "It is just like running Norton Utilities to clean up your disk.",
        "Furthermore, physical enclosure for information security purposes now matters less, while electronic security matters more.",
        "It was once essential to ring cities with defensive walls, but that is irrelevant now.",
        "And it was once crucial to lock office doors, so that the papers and files inside could be protected against dispersal or destruction, and so that their confidentiality could be preserved.",
        "(In fact that was one of the main reasons for the very existence of private offices.) Espionage was a matter of clandestinely breaking in and stealing papers or making illicit copies.",
        "If your files are online, though, and accessible to you anywhere you log in, you do not have to work in a physically secure space.",
        "You do want to be sure that those files are regularly backed up and electronically protected against unauthorized access, and you probably want to sit so that your laptop screen is protected from prying eyes.10 In other words, information security has been deterritorialized and shifted to a domain of abstract symbol manipulation.",
        "Selectively (though certainly not universally), space to space relationships are loosening.",
        "For convenience and security, old fashioned library reading rooms had to be adjacent to book stacks, but that constraint disappears when stacks become servers and carrels become wireless reception points.",
        "To make most efficient use of an expensive resource, office staff once needed convenient access to a central copying machine, but that imperative evaporates when making a copy becomes a matter of sending a file through a network rather than carrying an original to a machine, and when inexpensive, networked laser printers are widely distributed.",
        "As connectivity matters more, in many contexts, adjacency matters less, and architectural form is less tightly determined by the need to satisfy adjacency requirements.",
        "Even established ideas of flexibility and adaptability require reconsideration.",

        "Now the focus is shifting to self configuring electronic environments\u2014enabled by electronic devices that can immediately begin to communicate wirelessly with one another when they are brought into proximity and that can work together to support whatever activities are taking place.11 Laptops are beginning to talk wirelessly to video projectors, projectors and cameras to printers, telephones to speaker systems, video cameras to monitors, PDAs to other PDAs, automobiles to gas pumps, and so on.",
        "In some ways, then, we are returning to strategies and practices of preliterate, precapitalist times.",
        "Ancient Greek philosophers, for example, did not have offices and classrooms; they strolled with their students through the groves of academe.",

        "If you are a Heideggerian, you will probably fret about \"wandering\u201d versus \u201cdwelling.\u201d And, if you take the Hegelian position that surrounding oneself with tangible property is a way of imprinting your presence on the world (Jerome\u2019s books did not just serve his needs, they defined him), then you will be dispirited by digital dematerialization and networked server access.",
        "Perhaps, though, this just means that giants of thought are still creatures of their time\u2014and maybe, in these cases, too prone to generalize from the stability and clutter of the bourgeois drawing room.12 ELECTRONIC NON PLAN At a larger scale, the instrument for distinguishing and separating functions has long been land use zoning.",
        "This sometimes has a com monsense and unobjectionable function, as for example in mandating the separation of residential areas from noxious industry.",
        "But it has frequently been used to enforce far less benign forms of segregation.",
        "And there are far fewer good reasons to separate activities\u2014such as working, being entertained, and pursuing your social life\u2014when they are all supported by the same wireless, portable devices, and when, unobtrusively handled in this way, they do not interfere with the activities of others.",
        "There is, then, a new kind of opportunity to recoup the \u201cright to the city,\u201d which Henri Lefebvre powerfully characterized in terms of heterogeneity rather than monoculture, encounter rather than separation, and simultaneity instead of sequence, and which he saw as threatened by \u201cdiscriminatory and segregative organization.\u201d13 Land use planners might move toward Lefebvre\u2019s \u201cdiversification of space,\u201d in which \u201cthe (relative) importance attached to functional distinctions would disappear.\u201d The sixties Anglo American counterpart to Lefebvre\u2019s insistence on the right to the city was a provocative call for \u201cnon plan,\u201d set forth in a notorious New Society article by Reyner Banham, Paul Barker, Peter Hall, and Cedric Price.14 In it, the authors bluntly claimed that \u201cthe most rigorously planned cities\u2014like Haussmann\u2019s and Napoleon Ill\u2019s Paris\u2014have nearly always been the least democratic,\u201d and asked \u201cWhat would happen if there were no plan? What would people prefer to do, if their choice were untrammeled?\u201d This comported with contemporary architectural interest in combining serviced megastructures These proposals vividly expressed the possibility of flexibility and freedom of choice, but they mostly didn\u2019t deliver.",
        "Large scale physical reconfiguration of architectural space in response to changing needs has remained a slow, cumbersome, and expensive process.",
        "Furthermore, occupiable space is still a scarce resource, and physical reconfigurability does little to diminish problems of space allocation and coordination.",

        "One tale is of enclosure.",
        "The walls, as in other ancient, medieval, and Renaissance cities, protected the concentrations of assets and sedentarized populations within from nomadic bandits and mobile armies without.",
        "In addition, as Lewis Mumford cogently argued in The Culture of Cities, the power of massed numbers in itself gave the city a superiority over thinly populated, widely scattered villages, and served as an incentive to further growth.2 Density and defended walls provided safety, economic vitality, and long term resilience.",
        "In extreme conditions, when the city was under siege, the gates were closed, the battlements were manned, and the city became self contained for the duration.",
        "If you wanted to attack it, you called upon some technology to breach the defensive perimeter, like Joshua\u2019s trumpet, Achilles\u2019 wooden horse, Francesco di Giorgio\u2019s tunnel beneath the walls of Castel Nuovo, a battering ram, or a siege engine.",
        "The second tale is of connection.",
        "The central piazza, surrounded by public buildings, is both the focus of the internal street network and the local hub of a road network that extends through the gates and out into the countryside, linking the city to others.",
        "The piazza is\u2014like the server of a local ISP\u2014a node at which nearby and larger communities are connected.",
        "When the gates are open, the city functions as a crossroads rather than a sealed enclosure, a place of interaction rather than one of exclusion.",
        "Urban history is, from one perspective, a struggle of these narratives for dominance.",
        "Eventually, the network won.",
        "Mumford associated this victory with the rise of capitalism\u2014a new constellation of economic forces that \"favored expansion and dispersal in every direction, from overseas colonization to the building up of new industries, whose technological improvements simply canceled out all medieval restrictions.\u201d For emerging modern cities, \"the demolition of their urban walls was both practical and symbolic.\u201d3 Superficially, modern Manhattan resembles a scaled up version of Palma Nova; it has a regularized street grid, is surrounded by water, and can be accessed by a limited number of bridges and tunnels.",
        "But the networks are denser and more numerous, they extend the city\u2019s connections much further out into the world, and they provide many more functions.",
        "Road, rail, water, and air transportation links connect to local, regional, and global destinations.",

        "Networks fail\u2014sometimes catastrophically\u2014when backhoes cut telephone or power cables, blood clots block arteries, or accidents jam the 405 Freeway.",
        "They are particularly vulnerable to this form of failure at points where there is no alternative route (or, at least, no efficient one) for traffic to take.",
        "That is why links such as the Khyber Pass, or San Francisco\u2019s Bay Bridge, are of such strategic importance; break them, and you disconnect large chunks of network, on either side, from each other.",
        "It is even more effective, in general, to shut down a node\u2014particularly one at which many links converge.",
        "If an earthquake destroys a freeway interchange, for example, travel in several directions is blocked at that point.",
        "And if you close a major airline hub, such as Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport, you produce a major air travel disruption.",
        "Furthermore, nodes often concentrate more crucial functionality than links.",
        "Sever a vein, and you may survive, but stop your heart and you\u2019re a goner.",
        "Yank a cable at the periphery of a LAN and most of the network continues to function, but crash the central server and the whole network goes down.",
        "If part of a network fails to perform its function, the trouble may propagate to other links and nodes\u2014particularly where the network is tightly coupled.",
        "A sewer blockage can produce a backup to your sink or toilet, and a fender bender can quickly propagate traffic jams far back through a freeway network.",
        "This becomes particularly troublesome when there are no escape mechanisms, such as pressure valves and off ramps; that\u2019s why New Yorkers dread getting stuck in the Holland Tunnel.",
        "Even worse, propagation of overload conditions can cause progressive failure of network infrastructure.",
        "In an electric power network, for example, burnout of a transformer can propagate excess loads to other parts of the network, which fail in turn, and so on.",
        "It is much the same with nuclear chain reactions, and with progressive structural failures, like that of the World Trade Towers, where floors collapsed onto lower floors, which then became overloaded and collapsed themselves, and so on with gathering force.",
        "To be protected against progressive failure, networks need devices such as fuses or circuit breakers, which sacrifice themselves to prevent further propagation of damage.",
        "In large, high speed networks, such as modern power grids and the Internet, patterns of overload propagation and progressive failure are potentially very complex, hard to predict, and frustratingly difficult to control.",
        "Once they get started, even in a small way, there is an ever present danger that they will grow explosively to produce large scale, long term damage.",
        "In 1998, for example, the power grid of Auckland, New Zealand, experienced a cascading failure that badly damaged all four of the central business district\u2019s main power arteries.",
        "The New Zealand Stock Exchange shut down until it could switch to backup power, the central business district was darkened for many weeks, air conditioners and refrigerators went out (in the Southern Hemisphere summer months), and the pubs had to serve warm beer\u2014 something the locals took particularly amiss.",
        "In addition to hardware failure, software failure can also propagate alarmingly.",
        "In January 1990, a minor mechanical malfunction in an AT&amp;T telephone switching center in Lower Manhattan caused the switch to shut down and automatically reset its control software.",
        "When the switch came up again, it notified other switches around the country that they could begin routing calls to it.",
        "Unfortunately, these notifications triggered a control software bug, which shut down the switches that received it.",
        "When these switches restarted, they further propagated the problem, and so on.",
        "Before the problem could be diagnosed and corrected, it had affected all 114 switching centers in the AT&amp;T system, severely disabled the system for nine hours, prevented 70 million of the 138 million long distance and 800 number calls placed on the system that day from getting through, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in business losses.7 And it can get even worse; since different types of networks are often functionally interdependent, failure of one type can produce failure of another.",
        "Telecommunication and electrical supply networks are particularly closely intertwined; telecommunication devices require electric power, and increasingly, power grids are managed by means of sophisticated telecommunication systems.",
        "Similarly, if the power grid goes out, the traffic lights cease to function, and the traffic network rapidly snarls up.",
        "And where pumps power water and air supply networks, power failure quickly renders many buildings uninhabitable.",
        "Even where there is no direct functional interdependency, the physical collocation of network links can propagate failures; for example, the tunnels into Manhattan provide both transportation and telecommunication conduits, so destruction would simultaneously affect both types of networks.8 And the destruction of the World Trade Center towers took out both a major subway transportation node in the basement and a concentration of wireless telecommunication nodes on the roof.",
        "One often told, dramatic tale of cross network cascading is that of a Worcester, Massachusetts, kid who hacked a telephone switch, wiping out custom settings and disabling telephone service in the area.9 The automated control tower of the local airport used the telephone network to activate runway landing lights.",
        "Thus, when an approaching plane signaled the tower to switch on the lights, the lights failed to operate, and the airport had to be closed.",
        "STRUCTURE AND VULNERABILITY Sometimes, large networks fail\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014due to general destruction of their infrastructure.",
        "When an ice storm hit Quebec in January 1998, for example, it brought down trees, poles, pylons, and tens of thousands of miles of power lines spread over a huge area.",
        "As a result, large parts of Montreal were left without power for most of a freezing month, and the emergency repair effort was enormous.",
        "But under some circumstances, highly localized failure or destruction can also produce major outages.",
        "At the very dawn of the computer network era, pioneering researchers began to realize that the capacity of a network to continue functioning after damage depended a great deal upon its structure.",
        "Paul Baran introduced his seminal paper on distributed communications networks with a diagram showing three types of networks\u2014 centralized, decentralized, and distributed.10 The centralized networks consisted of links radiating from a central node, exactly as with the radial roads of Palma Nova and other centrally planned cities.",
        "It was, as Baran noted, \"obviously vulnerable as destruction of a single central node destroys communication between the end stations.\u201d High rise towers suffer from a similar vulnerability when, as in the World Trade Center towers, their vertical access routes are concentrated in central service cores.",
        "Building codes do require multiple, separated means of escape, and this may suffice in the case of relatively small fires, but it does not suffice when catastrophic events destroy cores entirely.",
        "The decentralized network was a \"set of stars connected in the form of a larger star,\u201d much like the patterns of major streets radiating from public places in the Wren plan for London, the Haussmann plan for Paris, and the L\u2019Enfant plan for Washington.",
        "The centers of stars were still points of vulnerability, but the destruction of one such subcenter would not be a complete disaster; this would disconnect nodes directly linked to it, but the rest of the network could continue to function.",
        "Thus decentralization provided a way of scaling up and of isolating the effects of damage.",
        "The distributed network was a nonhierarchical mesh, as in the street grids of Manhattan and Chicago, though not necessarily as regular.",
        "Its redundancy provided robustness; if nodes or links were destroyed, traffic could simply route around the damage.",
        "But there was an efficiency penalty; to get from one node to another, you typically had to pass through many intermediate nodes, which were poten tial points of inefficient transfer and congestion.",
        "If you travel through a street grid, you always have many options, and you are unlikely to get stuck if there\u2019s a blockage somewhere, but you will encounter many stop signs and traffic lights.",
        "Similarly, if high rise towers were interconnected by sky bridges, they would enhance safety through the increased redundancy and wider spatial distribution of their escape networks, but they would be harder to control by means of security checkpoints at entry level elevator lobbies.",
        "In practice then, large transportation, communication, and other networks are often combinations of stars and meshes\u2014seeking a balanced combination of the advantages of both.",
        "So Palma Nova has not only its radial arteries, but also several rings of streets concentrically around the central piazza, and smaller piazzas (forming mini hubs) at the centers of its wedge shaped segments.",
        "The radial streets of Paris and Washington are superimposed upon meshes and grids of more minor streets, and the radial transportation links of many modern cities are supplemented by ring roads and ring lines.",
        "Air transportation networks are increasingly organized around major hubs but continue to include links that do not pass through the hubs.",
        "And the vast structure of the Internet has turned out to be highly hierarchical, with a dominant pattern of major hubs, but also with significant amounts of meshing in many regions.11 ACCIDENT AND ATTACK The large, decentralized networks that increasingly dominate our globalized world have turned out to be remarkably resistant to random accidents and failures.",
        "Nodes and links may go down here and there, but unless they unfortunately happen to be vital hubs or critical arteries, the effects are usually fairly brief and localized.",
        "But deliberate attack is another matter.",
        "Intelligent attackers can pick out the most attractive targets\u2014going simultaneously for several major hubs, for example, rather than wasting their ammunition on peripheral nodes.",
        "Even a structure as large and heavily meshed as the Internet is probably very vulnerable to coordinated pinpoint attacks; there are good reasons to conceal, harden, and defend major switching nodes.",
        "The attack on New York\u2019s World Trade Center towers vividly drove home these lessons about network structure.",
        "In the immediate aftermath, the surface street network, which is highly redundant, continued to function effectively.",
        "The New York subway system is much less redundant, so destruction of a major node beneath the towers did produce significant, long term transportation outages.",
        "But the attraction of the target to the terrorists was not only the concentration of human life and the powerful symbolism of the towers, but also the role of Lower Manhattan as a key node in the global financial network\u2014supported by an astonishing concentration of telecommunications infrastructure.",
        "In September 2001, there was more fiberoptic cable under the streets of Manhattan than in all of Africa, the two main telephone switches in the Financial District had more lines than many European nations, and there were more than 1,500 antenna structures on top of the World Trade Center north tower.",
        "The destruction of telecommunications infrastructure was extensive.",
        "Verizon served more than three million local phone lines from its 140 West Street central office, which was badly damaged by debris, smoke, and water.",
        "AT&amp;T had a central office in the basement of the World Trade Center; this survived the building collapse but lost electric supply and eventually went down when backup battery power gave out at 4 p.m.",
        "on September 11.",
        "It had served 20,000 T1 lines and 1,200 T3 lines to customers throughout Lower Manhattan and as far away as Long Island, so outages occurred not only locally but also in a random pattern throughout the region.",
        "At least fifteen cellular telephone base stations were lost, while many others had their landline connections knocked out by the damage to Verizon\u2019s facility.",
        "And of course the antennas on top of the north tower were all gone.",
        "This loss of infrastructure combined with a surge in demand for telephone service, with the result that the telephone network became severely overloaded.",
        "On September 11, telephone traffic in the New York area was at about double the normal levels.",
        "Cellphone networks were jammed; during the morning, fewer than five percent of calls were connected.",
        "Nationally and internationally, AT&amp;T connected 431 million calls\u2014about twenty percent more than normal.",
        "To keep outgoing lines from New York and Washington open, AT&amp;T blocked incoming calls.",
        "It required an enormous telecommunications recovery effort to get the New York Stock Exchange back in operation six days later.",
        "The Internet continued to operate much as its designers had hoped.12 There were some localized outages due to infrastructure damage and power failures, there was a surge in email traffic, and major news Web sites quickly became overloaded, but all this had little effect on the global Internet.",
        "However, the New York metropolitan area was, at that point, the Internet\u2019s largest single international bandwidth hub, and several of its major switching centers (carrier hotels) were all within close proximity on the west side of Lower Manhattan.",
        "It became apparent that a coordinated attack on the carrier hotels might have disconnected New York from the rest of the world, or the U.S.",
        "from Europe\u2014though connections from the U.S.",
        "West Coast to Asia would still have continued to operate.",
        "FEAR OF FOREIGN BODIES But it can be better strategy to exploit, rather than destroy, the networks of your enemies.",

        "It has infiltrated itself into this human construction and has hijacked it for its own purposes.",
        "And in doing so, it has created a distributed state of siege\u2014not the geographically focused sort, such as Palma Nova\u2019s walls were designed to withstand, but one manifested at a million condoms.",
        "Unlike the plagues of old, which required population density to flourish and could often be kept at bay by isolating and quarantining populations, AIDS depends upon the existence of connected paths\u2014maybe extending over vast distances\u2014within a global network.",
        "The SARS epidemic of 2003 was a later variant on this theme.",
        "The virus was airborne, so face masks rather than condoms became the first line of defense.",
        "International gathering places\u2014hotels, restaurants, air terminals, and airliner cabins\u2014provided entry points into the long distance air transportation network, which quickly propagated cases from the point of origin in China to Hong Kong and Singapore, then throughout the world.",
        "The more you relied on this network, the more exposed you were.",
        "Computer viruses are chunks of mobile code in digital form, rather than genetic code in bioformat, but they turn out to operate in much the same way.",
        "They are too familiar, now, to require detailed explanation, and their potential for destruction has grown with the Internet.",
        "Just a week after September 11, for example, the Nimda virus struck 85,000 servers throughout the world, producing far more Internet congestion, outage, and economic damage than the infrastructure losses resulting from the World Trade Center attack.13 Such viruses dramatically illustrate the downsides of decentralizing production and dematerializing functionality; they can be produced by even the moderately computer literate (right down to very modestly skilled script kiddies) at any of the world\u2019s millions of Internet nodes and propagated rapidly from those nodes.",
        "They can even be injected wirelessly into the Internet from mobile and transient locations.",
        "And, like the HIV virus, they generate a globally distributed state of siege\u2014this time manifested at email filters to exclude suspicious incoming messages, virus protected PCs, and corporate network firewalls.",
        "Miniaturization, biotechnology, and nanotechnology provide yet more opportunities to infiltrate networks and turn them destructively back upon themselves.",
        "If you can produce small quantities of powerful toxins, virulent bioagents, or even vicious little nanobots, you can potentially distribute them to precisely where they will do most damage, through air and water utility networks.14 Air conditioning duct networks seem as if they were designed expressly for this purpose; they provide efficient conduits from conveniently accessible intakes to all the inhabited spaces of a building, bypassing guards and locked doors.",
        "In this case, the distributed siege points (now being put in place, in some contexts, as the danger is recognized) are filters, valves, and electronic sensors designed to sniff out and divert threats.",
        "Finally, the miniaturization of destructive power has extended the possibility of infiltration to all forms of transportation networks.",

        "If you can compromise shipping containers, you can probably deliver nuclear weapons into the hearts of major cities.15 And, particularly in the aftermath of the September 11 hijackings, airport check in gates have become the most vivid and obtrusive reminders of the emerging state of distributed siege.",

        "And effective, inexpensive, widely deployable filters and barriers are not easy to devise.17 The characteristic fear of our times is no longer of the barbarians beyond the gates (or beyond the Cold War missile shield), but of foreign bodies networked into our midst.18 In the context of transportation networks and human movement, it manifests itself in the understandable fear of the terrorist infiltrator and the suicide bomber, and in the indefensible (sometimes overlapping) ugliness of antiimmigrant, anti refugee, and anti minority demagoguery; the associated pathologies are closed borders, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing.",
        "At another level, it is the fear that containers and vehicles\u2014from letters to airliners\u2014will be infiltrated, hijacked, or redirected to serve as carriers of explosives and toxins.",
        "Within communication networks, it is the fear of viruses, worms, hackers, and crackers.",
        "And within networks of water and air transfer, and body to body contact, it is the fear of deadly contagion.",
        "DISPERSAL AND SWARMING If you don\u2019t want to be an easy and perpetually anxious target in a world of networks and distributed siege, one of your best strategies is to decentralize.",
        "Instead of concentrating your business organization in a conspicuous downtown office tower, you might disperse it to a collection of electronically interconnected suburban locations.",
        "Instead of running your terrorist organization from a base that is subject to preemptive and retaliatory attack, you might create a network and scatter its members throughout the community.",
        "In both cases, however, there is something to lose; intercommunication becomes more difficult and less effective, scale economies may disappear, and loss of regular face to face contact may result in decline in trust and cohesion among your members.",
        "But as the effectiveness of telecommunication increases and the risks of centralization increase, the balance may shift in favor of greater dispersal.",
        "The events of September 11 drove home the lesson that centralizing an organization at one location, such as a skyscraper carrying the corporate logo, does make it terribly vulnerable.",
        "As one New York real estate manager commented in the wake of the World Trade Center attack, \"I\u2019m not sure that tall trophy office buildings will ever be popular again.\u201d19 And as William Safire proposed in his op ed column: \"We\u2019re a big, roomy country.",
        "Physically decentralized government, tied together electronically, would be the strength of our nation if DC were paralyzed.\u201d20 These responses were probably exaggerated (particularly by anti urban conservatives), but it was clear that the tradeoffs in the balance of centralization versus dispersal would henceforth be evaluated differently.21 Technically, the agglomeration economies that motivate the clustering of functions within organizations, and of businesses in industrial clusters, are offset by the risks of intense spatial concentration.",
        "Where the benefits of agglomeration remain high relative to the risks of natural disasters, localized network failures (such as power blackouts), or terrorist attacks, clusters are likely to remain.",
        "But, where the risks of agglomeration are higher relative to the benefits (and, perhaps, where these risks are reflected in insurance rates and taxes to support protective services\u2014the so called terrorism tax), and where efficient network interconnection reduces the advantages of agglomeration, organizations are more likely to spread risk through decentralization.",
        "By taking advantage of wireless connection and miniaturized, portable equipment, you can add the strategic benefits of mobility to those of dispersal.",
        "Decentralization is by no means an entirely new idea among theorists of conflict and combatants.",
        "There have long been scattered, mobile guerrillas, irregulars, and resistance groups, but inexpensive, efficient, mobile telecommunication adds a new dimension to their operations; such groups can now act in much more effectively coordinated ways.",
        "In offensive mode, they can mount simultaneous attacks on key nodes in widely dispersed networks, such as the servers and switching hubs of a computer network, or the transformer stations of a power grid.",
        "They can converge on a target, in coordinated fashion, from many directions at once.",
        "And they can swarm\u2014suddenly and unexpectedly materializing at some location in order to accomplish their goal, then rapidly dispersing to avoid containment or retaliation.",
        "Electronically coordinated street demonstrators at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle demonstrated the efficacy of swarming,22 and the Critical Mass anticar bicyclists in the San Francisco Bay Area have done even better at suddenly appearing out of nowhere to \"cork\u201d intersections and choke traffic.23 \"Swarm warfare\u201d has become a fashionable topic among security analysts.24 The same technique could extend to telecommunication infrastructure.",
        "Even where nodes are multiplied and widely distributed, as with the Internet and cellular systems, they remain fixed targets.",
        "If nodes become wireless and mobile, however, the network itself transforms into a swarm that can rapidly reconfigure, elude attack, and move into areas of damage to restore service.",
        "After the 1994 North ridge earthquake, for example, cellphone providers developed a strategy of deploying trailer mounted mobile cell sites, together with temporary, point to point microwave links to replace lost landlines and rapidly restore service in damaged zones.",
        "After September 11 in New York, this strategy was effectively used to reconstruct cellphone coverage and reweave it into the larger network.",
        "And military strategists have begun to contemplate swarms of collaborating, robotic aircraft interconnected by an \"Internet in the sky.\u201d25 REPLICATION AND REPLACEABILITY If dispersal, mobility, and elusiveness do not sufficiently reduce your vulnerability, you might turn to replication and replaceability.",
        "This is not a new idea either; generals have frequently been prepared to throw replaceable foot soldiers into the breach, automobiles have reserve tanks, and building codes require alternative fire exits in case one gets blocked.",
        "But the availability of cheap, plentiful electronic devices gives the idea a new spin.",
        "The Internet, for example, is built from relatively inexpensive channels and switches\u2014which make extensive redundancy feasible and thus enable routing around damage sites.",
        "Even better, a mobile, ad hoc network, supported by portable, disposable wireless devices, would combine the advantages of fluidity and redundancy.",
        "This would be particularly difficult for enemies to take out as nodes could be scattered quickly around, they would not have fixed locations, and a lot of them would have to be found and eliminated to disable the network.",
        "If they did succeed in destroying some nodes, new ones would just pop up anyway.",
        "Defensive strategies that rely upon redundancy work even better with software than with hardware, since software can quickly and inexpensively be replicated, and the process of replication can readily be decentralized.",
        "Thus file backup and distribution of backup copies to distant locations have become standard practice.",
        "Once, you backed up your PC by saving work to floppy disks or tapes; now, increasingly, backup is a network function.",
        "Whenever you send an email, for example, you create copies on multiple servers, and those servers are automatically backed up at regular intervals.",
        "When you work on a networked computer, it is increasingly difficult to assure, when you wish to do so, that a file you create is not getting backed up somewhere.",
        "Organizations that rely upon digital data and cannot afford downtime frequently create redundant sites with both duplicate hardware and replicated data.",
        "Financial firms, in particular, have come to depend upon backup \"hot sites\u201d\u2014with duplicate hardware, replicated software and data, and a crew of operators\u2014that are ready to take over at a moment\u2019s notice.",
        "When the Lehman Brothers Manhattan data center was destroyed in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, the chief technology officer was able to activate a backup facility in New Jersey, from his Blackberry text messenger, while escaping down the stairs.",
        "The firm was trading again the next day.26 By noon on the eleventh, all major New York banks had activated their disaster recovery plans.",
        "Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost 700 employees, was trading from backup centers in New Jersey and London when the bond market reopened two days later.27 Many other affected financial firms used their disaster recovery contactors (SunGard, Comdisco, and others) to retrieve data from off site backup locations.28 But law firms, which depended more upon original documents on paper, recovered with much more difficulty.",
        "And at least one architecture firm, which did not have off site backup, had to retrieve files piecemeal from the servers of its collaborators and consultants.",
        "If instant recovery capacity is not necessary, backup sites can disperse over great distances.",
        "But where large amounts of data must be transferred to and from backup sites, and where high speed recovery is imperative, network capacity limits dispersal.",
        "Thus, for example, the ESCON protocol used by IBM mainframes to connect to remote mass storage devices is limited to about a forty kilometer radius.",
        "And the backup sites for Manhattan financial firms are mostly to be found elsewhere in Manhattan, in New Jersey, and in Brooklyn.",
        "Since September 2001, however, there has been heightened interest in putting distance into distributed computing architectures, so that computer clusters can extend beyond potential disaster footprints.",
        "This requires combination of high speed data links capable of operating over hundreds of kilometers with servers and storage systems designed to absorb increased load and to continue operating seamlessly when some of the nodes in the cluster go down.",
        "It seems likely that this sort of enterprise continuity technology will continue to develop.29 Switching to a backup site is not, of course, a possibility for the small lunch place adjacent to the large financial firm.",
        "In fact, the electronic relocation of its neighbor\u2019s center of activity may be disastrous for the lunch place, leaving it without customers.",
        "Strategies of electronic backup and redundancy are powerful, but their effects are differential.",
        "SELF REPLICATION AND MUTATION You can shift this principle to a metalevel; the process of replication and dispersal can, itself, be replicated, dispersed, and mobilized.",
        "This makes it more robust than a process centralized at a single, potentially vulnerable production facility.",
        "Parasites, bacteria, and viruses provide the model for this; under favorable conditions they are self replicating, and they can distribute themselves simultaneously through multiple channels, making them particularly difficult to stamp out.",
        "Since the operation of writing information in memory is fundamental to digital computation, the logic of replication quickly manifested itself on early computers.",
        "Programmers learned to code loops that would write the same information repeatedly into memory\u2014 rapidly filling it to overflowing.",
        "With slightly trickier logic, and abandonment of the distinction between program and data (easy in languages like Lisp), they could write chunks of code that replicated themselves.",
        "At this stage, the worst outcome of out of control replication was crashing an isolated computer\u2014and you could fix the damage by rebooting.",
        "But the interconnection of computers into networks instantly changed that.",
        "It became possible to send destructive code from computer to computer\u2014either explicitly, or more insidiously, by clandestinely attaching it to email or other transfers.",
        "Furthermore, it was quite trivial to write code that automatically replicated itself whenever it landed on a new host, then attached itself to outgoing email to propagate further.",
        "Thus in the Internet era computer viruses successfully imitated their biological predecessors.",
        "Mobile, self replicating code can be benign (like many biological viruses), and it can even provide an efficient way of performing useful functions on a large scale, but it can also wreak destruction.",
        "As Internet users have discovered to their chagrin, maliciously circulated viruses can overwrite memory, erase files, make software misbehave, display offensive messages, take over your machine to attack other machines, or simply crash your system.",
        "The varieties of damage that viruses can inflict are limited only by the imagination and technical skill (and it often doesn\u2019t take a lot) of programmers with bad intentions and network connections.",
        "By now a standard (indeed, often essential) defense against viruses is software that scans incoming mail to detect and block attached viruses and also scans disks to detect and eliminate any viruses that may have lodged there.",
        "But the difficulties are just like those encountered with defenses against biological viruses\u2014you need different remedies for different viruses, there is a continual threat of new viruses for which no defenses exist, and some viruses may replicate themselves with mutations that allow them to elude the defenses.",
        "Thus there is a problem of scale and complexity and an ongoing, escalating battle between virus and antivirus forces.",
        "Code replication not only provides the means to propagate viruses, it also provides a way to amass forces for sudden, large scale attacks from multiple directions.",
        "In distributed denial of service attacks on Internet servers, hackers surreptitiously take over many machines, then employ them simultaneously to fire streams of packets at target servers, thus overloading and bringing them down.",
        "Furthermore, denial of service attacks can be directed not just at a single server, but at multiple servers all at once, potentially providing a way to overcome the Internet\u2019s defensive redundancy.",
        "In October 2002, for example, a denial of service attack was directed against nine of the Internet\u2019s thirteen root servers scattered around the globe.30 A sustained, successful denial of service attack on all thirteen of the root servers would crash the Internet.",
        "BEYOND INTERNET VIRUSES By destroying digital resources, disabling the computers we have come to rely upon, and disrupting communications, Internet viruses can inflict immense economic damage, but they mostly aren\u2019t a direct threat to human life and safety.",
        "However, this will change as embedded networked devices proliferate, as our bodies become network nodes, and as transportation, power distribution, water, and air supply networks are increasingly intertwined with telecommunication networks.",
        "The price we will pay for integration and intelligent management of large scale networks is that of continuously and resourcefully defending them against more and more potent virus threats.",
        "Furthermore, as capacity for fabrication of physical artifacts shifts from centralized factories to small scale, networked, personal fabrication facilities, traditional monopolies on production and distribution of weapons begin to break down.",
        "Personal fabrication of printed texts, toys, or electronic components may be unambiguously a good thing, but personal fabrication of guns and bombs, from downloaded designs and apparently innocuous materials electronically ordered from scattered suppliers, certainly is not.",
        "Personal biotech nology\u2014maybe the fabrication of viruses from online genetic information and mail order supplies\u2014is even scarier.",
        "By 2002 researchers had, for example, fabricated infectious polioviruses using a publicly available genome sequence, inert chemicals, and modest laboratory equipment.31 Self replicating nanobots (which eliminate the distinction between production machinery and the products of that machinery) are not inconceivable\u2014though many scientists are skeptical.",
        "And the most apocalyptic scenario is of a world suddenly overwhelmed by runaway, self replicating gray goo.",
        "As Bill Joy has suggested, we now have the possibility \"not just of weapons of mass destruction but of knowledge enabled mass destruction (KMD), this destructiveness hugely amplified by the power of self replication.\u201d32 Where cities from Troy to Palma Nova defended their encircling walls, New York and other twenty first century cities must defend their distributed networks against accident and attack.",
        "They must protect physical network infrastructure against destruction not only locally but also to far flung extremities.",
        "They must ensure that there is sufficient redundancy in vital networks to prevent their being vulnerable to failure through destruction of a few key nodes or links.",
        "They must introduce circuit breakers, relief valves, and similar protections against failure propagation.",
        "They must find effective ways to guard against introduction of explosives, toxins, bioagents, portable code, and other destructive agents, and to guard against hijacking of vehicles, servers, and similar delivery devices.",
        "And cities must contend with both threats of physical destruction and threats to the logical integrity of networks from viruses, worms, software attack tools, and the like.",
        "Conversely, if cities can keep their networks operating in times of disaster, they can quickly mobilize regenerative resources.",
        "Transportation networks can bring in relief supplies from distant parts of the globe.",
        "Mobile wireless nodes can swiftly restore telecommunications.",

        "12 LOGIC PRISONS According to popular lore (and numerous unfortunate jokes), Saint Peter stands guard at the pearly gates, downloads your lifetime track record when you show up looking for admission to the Heavenly City, and decides whether you get access privileges or not.",

        "Technologies of surveillance and data collection, pattern recognition and data mining, and identity management have now converged with those of access management to enable formidable new systems of social control.",
        "At the core of these systems are access control lists, and their inverse, blacklists.",
        "Such lists include and exclude, distinguish friend from adversary, and in doing so construct political identity.",
        "To create them is to exercise power, and to be on them (or not) is to be subject to power.",
        "ELECTRONIC ACCESS CONTROL The idea of an access control list first arose, in its modern, digital form, in the early days of multiuser computing.1 Users did not want others to be able to mess with their files, so operating systems were designed to keep track of the users who could read from, write to, or copy particular files.",
        "Essentially, operating systems maintained tables listing users along one axis, and files along the other, with entries specifying whether access was to be allowed or not.2 A row listed the files a particular user could access, and a column listed the users who could access a particular file.",
        "And there were caste systems; the most privileged users got access to everything, the least privileged got very little.",
        "Classification simplified this management task.",
        "If managers could formulate policies in terms of broad classes of users rather than individuals, and classes of things to be accessed, they could quickly reduce the sizes of access control tables and the complexity of associated management tables.",
        "They could establish and enforce general rules, for example, that only high level staff within an organization could access files of salary data or enter the card keyed executive dining room.",
        "As large computer networks developed, access control systems became even more crucial.",
        "Since anyone might potentially access a site from anywhere in the network (anywhere in the world, in the case of the Internet), it was imperative to define, for each particular site, precisely who was allowed to do so; if you didn\u2019t, it was like leaving your front door unlocked to the whole world.",
        "In online communities, and persistent multiuser games\u2014which might engage millions\u2014the associated caste systems often evolved into elaborate structures that expressed themselves in terms of ability to change features of the shared environment.",
        "Lowly users might dress and drive their avatars, but more privileged ones might create persistent architecture, and the most privileged might alter the very infrastructure and rules of the game.",
        "Where code is the law, access to code makes you legislator and law enforcement.",
        "Furthermore, malicious hackers have now become much more sophisticated and have figured out that that they do not need to rattle doorknobs electronically themselves; they can write code to search automatically through the Internet for vulnerable machines to crack.",
        "So access control has become not just a matter of managing human users, but also of fending off automated break in attempts.",
        "The scale and complexity of the access management problem has rapidly grown.",
        "Today, as more and more devices get embedded intelligence and IP addresses, access control lists are extending their power into the everyday physical world.",
        "They have accomplished a species jump, from cyberspace to architecture.",
        "This has been prompted, in part, by the spread of embedded intelligence.",
        "If a home appliance has a processor and an IP address, it becomes potentially hackable (a Bulgarian teenager could reset your alarm clock, lock your air conditioner at a teeth chattering temperature, turn all your audio devices up to maximum volume, and flash your living room lights on and off), so it needs access control.",
        "Thus your domestic access control lists begin to define who, physically or telepresently, is welcome in your house.",
        "The same goes for your automobile: instead of keys, future automobiles will probably have lists of authorized drivers.",
        "In general, locks on gates and doors are evolving from metal to metal mechanisms to programmable electromechanical devices.",
        "They are increasingly being networked; and they are also getting lists of authorized users.",
        "(Instead of turning a key in a hotel room door, you swipe a card.) In other words, the technologies of access control in physical space and cyberspace\u2014once very distinct\u2014are converging.",
        "And so, of course, are the possibilities of misuse and abuse.",
        "Governments might control citizen movement by instantly reprogramming physical access to public spaces or by using electronic road pricing systems to create electronic cordons that are prohibitively expensive to cross, police in pursuit of fugitives might create instant holding cells around them, management engaged in labor disputes might program electronic lockouts, merchants might automatically exclude you from their stores if your credit isn\u2019t good enough, and burglars might simply reprogram your front door.",
        "Furthermore, delivery of access control, like that of many other functions, can migrate from architectural elements to portable, wireless devices.",
        "Parolees, for example, may now be required to strap GPS enabled tracking devices to their ankles.3 Supervisors can establish exclusion and inclusion zones for each offender.",
        "According to the American Probation and Parole Association\u2019s manual on electronic offender supervision technology, \"Exclusion zones are areas the offender is not permitted to go, such as parks and schools for a pedophile, a former partner\u2019s home or place of employment for a domestic batterer, or bars for an alcoholic....",
        "Inclusion zones are areas the offender is expected to be at various times, such as his workplace during the day and home at night.\u201d The inclusion and exclusion zones are entered on a screen displayed map, and the system transmits an alert \"any time the offender enters an exclusion zone or leaves an inclusion zone at the wrong time.\u201d These systems can be extended to monitor for alcohol and blood consumption, and it is not difficult to imagine versions that could deliver painful electric shocks (a technique already used on dogs) or immobilizing drugs whenever a location or behavioral violation is detected.",
        "But the technical details of electronic access control are not, in the end, the crucial issue; you can accomplish much the same results by putting the functionality into the architecture or attaching it to people.",
        "It is far more important to focus upon the specifics of access control policies in particular contexts\u2014and on who has the authority to implement them.",
        "IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION For good or ill, access control lists are simple and powerful, but they suffer from the obvious problem that names are not reliably unique; a glance at any large telephone directory or payroll file will confirm this.",
        "A related problem is that naming authorities may have overlapping jurisdictions and inconsistent policies.",
        "The remedy favored by armies, corporations, and some central governments is to issue everyone a unique serial number.4 (The ancillary consequence is that, if you don\u2019t have a number, you\u2019re a nonperson.) This is a straightforward technical solution, but it may invest far too much power for comfort in the issuing organization.",
        "An even more serious problem is that names may be stolen; someone seeking access may not be who he claims to be.5 Generally, then, access control systems require you to verify your identity in some way.",
        "A standard authentication strategy is to request some piece of information that a random access seeker is not likely to possess, such as your mother\u2019s maiden name, and to check this against information that you have previously supplied.",
        "A now familiar variant, where better security is required, is to request a secret password\u2014but, as most of us have discovered, it is easy to forget or confuse passwords, and it is easy to write software that will cycle through permutations of characters to find a password that works.",
        "A yet more sophisticated approach is to encrypt information and require a secret key to decrypt it.",
        "But even encryption, in the end, just shifts the problem to another level; just as you can steal a name, you can (usually, admittedly, with a bit more difficulty) steal a password or a key as well.",
        "Instead of requesting information you carry in your head, an access management system can demand some physical thing you carry in your pocket.",
        "In the pre electronic era, this might have taken the form of a letter of introduction (maybe with a wax seal), a passport, an ID card, or a metal key that you inserted into a matching lock\u2014 all of which, of course, might be lost, stolen, faked, or duplicated.",
        "Today it is likely to bear a barcode, a magnetic stripe, a memory chip that encodes digital information, or a mechanism that performs the cryptographic task of computing a one way function.6 Thus, for example, you access an ATM machine, a hotel room, or a card keyed building by swiping a plastic card.",
        "With this strategy, you can end up carrying many different cards and other physical identifiers in your pockets, and you are in deep trouble if your identification tokens are lost or stolen.",
        "Finally, an access management system might not be concerned with what people possess, but might rely on measuring what they are \u2014 for example, by automatically matching their fingerprints.7 This biometric strategy requires technology for quickly and accurately measuring biological characteristics, storing profiles that identify individuals, and matching profiles of access seekers against stored profiles.",
        "Electronic fingerprinting devices, hand geometry assayers, face recognition systems, and iris and retina scanners have all been employed for this purpose.",
        "Success so far has been mixed, but there is little reason to doubt that the technology will continue to improve.",
        "Short of having your hands chopped off or your eyeballs poked out, you cannot accidentally lose your biometric identifiers, and it is usually difficult and painful to remove them deliberately.",
        "(It\u2019s not like cutting up a credit card.) Still, you can fool biometric systems with masks, gloves, and prostheses, and a clever makeup artist might steal your face, which, unlike a credit card, you cannot have reissued.",
        "None of these basic authentication strategies solves the problem of the attacker who somehow breaches the defenses and then (like the soldiers hidden in the Trojan horse) has free reign to cause damage.",
        "So some of the most advanced security systems now check credentials electronically at frequent intervals.",
        "To stay logged into a particularly sensitive computer system, for example, you may need a pocket wireless device that continually transmits random numbers that match numbers stored in the access management system.",
        "If the transmission falters, or the numbers do not match, you instantly get disconnected.",
        "For access managers\u2014from systems operators to border guards\u2014effective combinations of these identification and authentication strategies are increasingly crucial to success.",
        "For users of buildings and systems, and citizens of cities, the capacity to electronically verify one\u2019s right to use a name\u2014in multiple contexts and over extended time periods\u2014is now essential.",
        "Without such capacity, in a digitally networked environment with electronically managed access, there can be no freedom of movement and action.",
        "IDENTITY IN MULTIPLE CONTEXTS Most of us, in our daily lives, need access to many different physical and online places.",
        "Consequently, we must carry numerous access devices and remember multiple IDs and passwords.",
        "These may need to be updated as we change employers or affiliations, and as organizations merge, move, or reorganize.",
        "And the difficulties can be complicated by the use of different names in different contexts\u2014perhaps a full, formal name as shown on your birth certificate and passport, a nickname at your local bar, a writer\u2019s pseudonym, a stage name, a vanity license plate, and different avatars and handles in different online environments.",
        "Not only is this condition a potential source of confusion and error, it also introduces annoying and wasteful delays as we are forced to reidentify and reauthenticate ourselves when moving from place to place.",
        "As our identities become more complex and multifaceted, they increasingly require sophisticated management, and software is emerging to fill the need.",
        "The Microsoft Passport system, for example, is intended for use by Microsoft customers, business partners, and affiliates.",
        "It allows you to \"use one name and password to sign in to all.NET Passport participating sites and services.\u201d8 You can sign up to \"store personal information in your.NET Passport profile and, if you choose, automatically share that information when you sign in so that participating sites can provide you with personalized services.\u201d Similarly, the Liberty Alliance Project promises to \"deliver and support a federated network identity solution for the Internet that enables single sign on for consumers as well as business users in an open, federated way.\u201d9 Unlike Microsoft Passport, it does not depend upon a single, central authority to maintain personal information.",
        "It proposes, instead, that it will enable businesses and users to manage their own data through the use of an open, interoperable standard for federated network identity.",
        "Federated spatial identity might one day be managed in much the same way\u2014emptying your pockets of multiple keys and swipe cards.",
        "Another approach, proposed by the National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, would make use of \"clustered IDs.\u201d10 This represents a different tradeoff between the efficiencies of centralization and the privacy and liberty protections of decentralization.",
        "It would encourage the development of multiple identity management systems operating across different collections of businesses, government departments, and so on, and would not require a single identifier that followed citizens everywhere.",
        "TRACKING AND PROFILING You can explicitly sign up for access to a physical or online site, you can be put on a list (maybe without your knowledge) by an access manager, or more insidiously, you can be put on a blacklist.",
        "Lists that emerge in these ways are not static; they are constructed and reconstructed over time, as access managers decide whom to include and exclude.",
        "To provide a basis for these decisions, managers collect and record data about individuals\u2014for example, the sorts of data you provide on an employment, driver\u2019s license, credit card, passport, or visa application.",
        "Subsequently, they may add information about your activities and behavior, such as traffic violations, purchases and payments, or border crossings.",
        "The technology for this developed enormously during the 1990s, as Web activity generated unprecedented quantities of behavioral data and as electronic access control became an increasingly pressing issue.11 To track your activities and behavior, and hold you accountable for them, access managers must be able to identify you and follow your identity through time; that\u2019s why bank robbers and Mardi Gras revelers wear masks\u2014to create \"time outs,\u201d during which they cannot be identified.",
        "(And that\u2019s why alibis are also important.) Conversely, electronic announcement of your identity is a form of unmasking and, as such, creates opportunities for tracking and profiling.",
        "You explicitly generate such opportunities whenever you assert and authenticate your identity by providing a password or swiping a card.",
        "And you implicitly produce them when you carry RFID devices: if cars have transponders, you can electronically check who\u2019s in your parking lot, and if students in a classroom have RFID tags, teachers can electronically take attendance.",
        "Some biometric systems, such as face recognizers, also make identity electronically observable.",
        "At the extreme, GPS equipped offender supervision systems can create continuous traces of where the wearer has been, and when.",
        "Your activities online already get tracked routinely, and in detail.",
        "Whenever you log into a site as an authorized user, the files you access and the times you access them will be recorded\u2014and system administrators will be able to trace through the log to see who you are and what you have been up to.",
        "(To facilitate this, many Web sites require you to register.) On electronic commerce sites, the record of your transactions becomes a valuable marketing tool.",
        "Even if you just use a browser to enter a publicly accessible Web site, you will deposit more information about your identity in the site\u2019s log file than you may imagine, and your activities on the site will be tracked.12 Everywhere in cyberspace, you leave electronic footprints.",
        "The point was vividly dramatized when, in April 2002, a Princeton admissions officer clandestinely entered a password protected Yale admissions decision Web site.",
        "The Yale system administrators traced back the source of the intrusion, and it was soon all over the 13 newspapers.",
        "As electronic identification is increasingly required for access to physical spaces as well as online ones, electronic tracking inexorably follows.",
        "It is often needed for billing purposes, and of course it may be put to other uses as well.",
        "Your monthly credit card bill may list the times and places at which your transponder equipped car passed through checkpoints, just as your cellphone bill lists the locations of calls.",
        "Similarly, a workplace that is subdivided into card key accessed rooms can keep detailed track of when employees show up and leave, and where and when employees spend their time at work\u2014and it had better not be too much in the lunchroom or the washroom! In this respect physical space increasingly resembles cyberspace.",
        "DATA WAREHOUSES It might logically seem that all these electronic activity records would remain associated with the sites and organizations that collect them, to be used only in those particular contexts.",
        "This has traditionally been the case; employers, retailers, educational institutions, credit agencies, license issuers, and immigration authorities have all maintained their separate databases, and it has not been easy to consolidate them.",
        "This provides a natural privacy safeguard; if you don\u2019t want your activities at some physical or online site to be logged, you can simply avoid it\u2014 much as celebrities try to protect their privacy by avoiding being seen in public places.",
        "Another possibility is that databases will increasingly be consolidated in data warehouses\u2014thus creating more comprehensive logs of user activities and reducing the likelihood that users can escape the net.",
        "(Advocates like to use the jargon of eliminating data \u201cstovepipes\u201d\u2014implying that it is just about business efficiency.) Nationwide identity cards and numbers greatly facilitate warehousing.",
        "Such consolidation has generally been opposed by privacy advocates, and centralized, consolidated databases would provide attractive targets for break in attempts and denial of service attacks.",
        "However, nationwide identification systems and large scale data warehousing have had more advocates since September 2001\u2014particularly in the United States.14 It is also possible that databases will not be formally consolidated, but that resourceful programmers who gain access to multiple sites (either legally or illegally) will be able to link an individual\u2019s disparate records to construct a single record.",
        "The more common elements (such as names, addresses, and ID numbers) there are in different databases, the easier this ad hoc correlation becomes.",
        "It seems most likely that personal data management will eventually evolve into a complex, distributed function in which some data are collected and managed at the physical and online sites you visit, some are maintained personally (much as you may now maintain resumes and personal Web pages), and some are maintained by trusted third parties who are in the business of guaranteeing completeness and accuracy.",
        "There will be associated, potentially regulated practices of transferring data among repositories, and correlating and crosschecking data from different sources.",
        "One way or another, though, as an inhabitant of an electronically networked world, you not only have a verifiable name, you have extensive records of your background and past actions associated with that name.",
        "Your reputation depends upon these records, you may be held accountable for them in various ways, and you may end up negotiating the conditions under which these records are constructed, accessed, and interrelated.",
        "Large scale database consolidation is not just a matter of technical efficiency; it fundamentally changes the conditions of urban life.",
        "Until recently, personal privacy depended heavily upon scale effects; small, traditional villages mostly provided very little of it, but large, modern cities allowed the possibility of disappearing into the anonymous masses.",
        "It also depended upon the localization of knowledge; if you wanted to leave your sordid small town past behind, you could run off to join the French Foreign Legion, or just move to L.A.",
        "Now, in the global village, electronic data collection, storage, correlation and analysis technologies, combined with high speed electronic transfer of information, have radically shifted the natural balance of power in favor of snoopers and list makers.",
        "Unless rigorously enforced privacy policies intervene, computer power overcomes scale, and networks defeat distance.",
        "Once access managers have databases resulting from surveillance or tracking, they can implement software that looks for matches to things that interest them.15 If they capture facial images of passengers passing through an airport security checkpoint, for example, they can check for close matches to photographs of suspected terrorists.",
        "Algorithms that perform this task are statistically based, so it is necessary to set a threshold of similarity.",
        "If this threshold is too high, they can expect relatively few positive matches, and there is a high likelihood that actual terrorists will slip through unrecognized.",
        "If it is too low, they will get a large number of false alarms, and, like the boy who cried wolf, the system will lose credibility.",
        "More abstractly, access managers can look for digital signatures in data about personal characteristics and behavior.",
        "This is like searching for a few unusually shaped straws in a large haystack, but sophisticated analysis techniques combined with massive computing power make it increasingly feasible.",
        "For example, the U.S.",
        "Transportation Security Agency has pursued development of a passenger profiling system known as CAPPS II.16 Credit card companies have long analyzed patterns of card use in order to detect fraud.",
        "And financial institutions have begun to monitor and correlate customer activity and to report suspicious patterns to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.17 Of course, it all depends upon the definitions of target signatures\u2014on what particular access managers might mean by \"dangerous\u201d or \"suspicious.\u201d It is not always necessary to predefine patterns of interest.",
        "For decades, numerical taxonomists and cluster analysts have computed measures of similarity among digital descriptions of things (such as customer activity profiles) and have used these measures to construct similarity classes.",
        "Online retailers, in particular, have learned to sort customers into groups with similar buying habits and to use this information for pinpoint marketing\u2014recommending books and CDs when you log on to a retail site, for example.",
        "This is harmless enough when you find yourself clustered with purchasers of, say, English romantic poetry, but you may attract unwelcome attention if you get grouped with purchasers of bomb making manuals and extremist political tracts.",
        "It is also possible to extract pertinent facts from a behavioral profile, add rules, and apply an inference engine to derive potentially telling conclusions.",
        "For example, a system might infer that a car was speeding from the time intervals between charges at turnpike toll booths.",
        "Or it might infer that someone had made a plane journey from the short time intervals between cellphone calls from widely separated cities.",
        "Precrime does not require mutants floating in vats, as in Minority Report \u2014just a database, rules and profiles, inference engines, and data mining algorithms.",
        "And, if the conclusions they draw are not one hundred percent accurate, then that can always be dismissed as collateral damage\u2014unfortunate, but justified by the end result.",
        "SCIENTIA EST POTENTIA In the past, defenders of places and populations could mostly depend upon more traditional strategies for distinguishing between friends and adversaries.",
        "The matter could often be settled, very simply, by relationship to physical boundaries; if you were inside the city walls, the default assumption was that you were one of us, but if you were outside, you were presumed to be one of them.",
        "Sometimes, as well, it could be determined by ethnic or gender markers, or by military uni forms\u2014blue versus gray, red coats, red shirts, brown shirts, and black shirts.",
        "But in a networked world, foes are sometimes shadowy, spatially dispersed, and mobile.18 You cannot look down at them from the ramparts, they don\u2019t have evident concentrations of fixed assets, and there aren\u2019t obvious targets to bomb.",
        "So governments that need to protect their citizens from them must first construct their identities: it doesn\u2019t help to declare war on an abstract noun such as \u201cterrorism\u201d unless there is some algorithm\u2014increasingly likely to be one that is applied to electronic traces of activities\u2014for enumerating and locating members of the class of terrorists.",

        "The guards aren\u2019t in watchtowers.",
        "They rely upon networked surveillance and tracking systems, data warehouses, and pattern recognition and data mining systems.",

        "In 1520 Ferdinand Magellan named Tierra del Fuego (land of fire) for the numerous blazes that he observed there.",
        "And in 1773, for similar reasons, Tobias Furneaux named the Bay of Fires on the northern coast of Tasmania.",
        "If you walk the shores of the Bay of Fires today, you can still see the hints and traces of a tragically vanished nomadic people.",
        "There are ancient shell middens among the cliffs.",
        "At the freshwater lagoons behind the dunes, near to the feeding grounds of wallabies and kangaroos, the now silent campsites remain inviting.",
        "The fires and smoke plumes that impressed Furneaux were, for the brief moments that they flared into warmth and light, the centers of mobile communities\u2014 places where people gathered, talked, cooked, slept, and cared for one another.",
        "For such nomads, the most basic and obvious ethical principle\u2014 and one crucial to social cohesion\u2014must have been that of reciprocity: take responsibility for the welfare of others in the group because you expect them to do the same for you.1 The sense of collective enterprise and mutual obligation tempered self interest.",
        "But application of the principle of reciprocity was strictly geographically bounded: it would be hard to argue that the moral obligations of group members extended far beyond the circle of warmth\u2014to include, say, the citizens of London, or even the inhabitants of the Australian mainland on the far side of the strait to the north.",
        "The Tasmanian aborigines had been completely isolated for thousands of years.",
        "There was literally no connection to the outside world.2 The inhabitants of the Bay of Fires did not know of these distant people and could take no actions that affected them.",
        "NETWORKS OF RECIPROCITY The navigators saw the world differently.",
        "They were engaged in constructing a network of sea transportation routes that was to blanket the globe and form increasingly important linkages among remotely situated people.",
        "And these linkages, as those who took the trouble to reflect upon the question began to realize, affected the extension of reciprocity.",
        "The expanding circle of contact, trade, and capacity to do good and harm might have suggested that mere distance no longer made a moral difference, and indeed the seafaring eighteenth century was that of the first declarations of universal human rights.",
        "But the Victorian moral philosopher Henry Sidgwick was to give an answer more typical of the emerging colonial era, as follows: We should all agree that each of us is bound to show kindness to his parents and spouse and children, and to other kinsmen in a less degree: and to those who have rendered services to him, and any others whom he may have admitted to his intimacy and called friends: and to neighbors and to fellow countrymen more than others: and perhaps we may say to those of our own race more than to black or yellow men, and generally to human beings in proportion to their affinity to ourselves.3 Implicit in Sidgwick\u2019s argument is the idea that moral obligation to one\u2019s fellow human beings rapidly diminishes with distance.",
        "In Sidgwick\u2019s world, parents, spouse, and children were likely to be very close at hand\u2014probably in the same house.",
        "Other relatives, neighbors, and friends formed a wider geographic circle\u2014mostly in the same town.",
        "Fellow countrymen constituted a wider circle still, and those of other countries were very distant: the black people of Tasmania were a voyage of many months away.",
        "Casual racism aside, Sidgwick\u2019s analysis made considerable practical sense.",
        "Social groups and communities were largely place based, and webs of mutual aid attenuated as they spread out from their centers, so it was reasonable enough to argue that obligation did as well.",
        "You had many obligations to those with whom you interacted intensely, over extended periods, but fewer to those with whom your interactions were limited or blocked by the impedance (some would say the tyranny) of distance.",
        "But the racism that Sidgwick embraced turned out, of course, to be far from harmless.",
        "The ever extending network of sea routes had, by then, brought Europeans and Tasmanians into close contact.",
        "And the argument that native Tasmanians had \"little affinity to ourselves\u201d was being used by European settlers to justify their extermination.",

        "You can tell your friends from your enemies, grudges and favors matter, and it is important to protect your reputation.",
        "But what happens when villages grow into large cities? Both Plato and Aristotle argued that the social glue breaks down at the point where citizens become strangers to one another, so communities should not scale up beyond that.",
        "In his Laws, Plato suggested that the population of an ideal city state should not exceed about 5,000 citizen farmers, plus their families and slaves, and a few resident aliens.4 And, in his Politics, Aristotle remarked: \"In order to give decisions on matters of justice, and for the purpose of distributing offices of merit, it is necessary that the citizens should know each other and know what kind of people they are.\u201d5 After pointing out that excessive population also made it \"easy for foreigners and aliens resident in the country to become possessed of citizenship,\u201d he summarized: \"Here then we have ready to hand the best limits of a state: it must have the largest population consistent with catering for the needs of a self sufficient life, but not so large that it cannot be easily surveyed.\u201d In other words, it had to be possible to know your fellow citizens through face to face contact, and to build up webs of mutual aid and obligation through that contact.",
        "The central agora, which provided a place for all the citizens to meet, was the material, architectural expression of this idea.",
        "Ferdinand Tonnies, pioneering German sociologist and contemporary of Sidgwick, provided a more nuanced suggestion\u2014that the principle of reciprocity began to operate in different ways as settlements grew.",
        "Gemeinschaft (community), in his memorable formulation, was characterized by \"intimate, private and exclusive living together\u201d in families, kinship and friendship groups, villages and neighborhoods.",
        "Gesellschaft (society), on the other hand, was the \"artificial construction of an aggregate of human beings\u201d\u2014the big, impersonal city.6 It is certainly possible to quarrel with some of the details and subtleties of this distinction, and subsequent sociologists and social theorists have hardly been hesitant to do so, but it seems to me that Tonnies got it roughly right.",
        "Gemeinschaft doesn\u2019t scale, but other mechanisms take over.",
        "Cities are not just larger than villages: they are materially, socially, and ethically different.",
        "Through the close proximities they establish, through shared use of public space, through common dependence upon complex and vulnerable infrastructure, and through joint access to vital networks of limited capacity, the world\u2019s great cities have become zones of dense, inescapable interdependencies among their citizens\u2014most of whom know very little of one another.7 They therefore depend upon sufficient levels of communication, cooperation, and trust among strangers; if this breaks down, cities cease to function.",
        "As the beating victim Rodney King famously pleaded in 1992, with Los Angeles exploding in riot and flames around him, \"Can\u2019t we all just get along?\u201d It is not that cities are domains free of difference and conflict: rather, they rely upon the capacities of their highly evolved cultures and institutions\u2014of ballot boxes, legal systems, markets, civil society, critical discourse, and political activism\u2014to domesticate hostility, to constructively manage differences and conflicts, and indeed to generate creative energy from them.",
        "In other words, they are not just physical constructions, nor simply facilitators of economic, social, and cultural activity: they are also, crucially if imperfectly, systems of ethically guided interaction contrived according to the Rodney King principle\u2014to allow large numbers of people, who do not necessarily know one another, to get along.",

        "Before long, other Web sites throughout the world were publishing details of local demonstrations, and portal sites like stopwar.org.uk were providing hyperlinked directories.",
