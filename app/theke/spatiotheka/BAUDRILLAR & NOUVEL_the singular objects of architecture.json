    "content": "Foreword K. Michael Hays The Singular Objects of Architecture should not create the expectation that either architecture or philosophy will be treated in this dialogue in anything like a traditional way (which, were it the case, would seem not so much old fashioned as reactionary, coming from two of the few cultural figures practicing today that we could still dare to call progressive). Indeed, it is better to state the reverse: what first strikes one as extraordinary about this conversation is that architecture and philosophy are treated with any distinction at all by progressive thinkers in our present era. In our own time, the de differentiation of disciplines and the tendentious erasure of boundaries between specific cultural materials and practices promise to homogenize all distinction, difference, and otherness into a globalized, neutralized sameness. Much of what claims to be progressive thought is happy to aestheticize this situation, to accelerate its effects, and to trade in any remaining individuality or singularity of thought for a randomized, spread out delirium. The flattening seems to have been chosen. Besides, any disciplinary autonomy or expertise that might counter this leveling tendency is destined to be crushed anyway under the massive movement of the world system itself, to be emulsified along with everything else into vil vffi [] Foreword so many cultural and economic fluids. What is extraordinary about this conversation, then, is its declaration, against all that, to search for singular objects (rather than globalized fluids) as might be found in architecture and philosophy. \u201cWe\u2019re not heading for disaster, we\u2019re already in the midst of total disaster,\u201d Nouvel declares at one point. Yet neither he nor Baudrillard ever laments the loss of a real or idealized past, nor do they accept, not even for a moment, the cynically complacent preemption of the future. The second surprise of The Singular Objects of Architecture is that what is offered, both as program and as practice exemplified in this particular dialogue, is a renewal of utopian thought, a revived attempt at envisioning a possible future out of our disastrous present, a way of thinking that has been under ban now for more than two decades. Against the hegemony of the antiutopian, real time thinking of our contemporary technocratic positivism and experiential nominalism (\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is mine, and you can\u2019t feel it\u201d), the singular object must be anticipatory, inexhaustible, and shared; it must destroy culture (or what has become of it) and redistribute the leftovers. And so, while architecture and philosophy are treated together as parts of a period problem\u2014as disciplines and practices with specific histories, transitions, and transformations, subjected to the desultory effects of history now, in our own period\u2014they will not remain unchallenged or unchanged in this dialogue. If the singular object is to be both utopian and destructive, future directed and exquisitely representative of the present, it will be a peculiar object indeed. Its model will be neither architecture nor philosophy freestanding, as traditionally practiced, but a productive enfolding of one into the other\u2014an event more than an object, a constructional operation in which each discourse interprets the other but nevertheless produces a new, irreducible, singular thing: that peculiar thing we call theory. \u201cI feel that thought, theory, is inexchangeable,\u201d says Baudrillard. \u201cIt can\u2019t be exchanged for truth or for reality. Exchange is impossible. It\u2019s because of this that theory even exists.\u201d Theory is the diagram of the singular object of architecture. This, at least, should come as no surprise, for work of such large ambition as Foreword [] ix is evidenced here is to be found today almost nowhere other than theory. Theory is ready to travel. Although at its best, theory will stay close to the historicity of its material, mediating between specific cultural practices and specific historical contexts, theoretical constructions also possess an uncanny capacity to cross over, drift, and expand across disciplines, however much authors, institutions, and orthodoxies try to confine them. Theory is autonomous (\u201cinexchangeable\u201d), but it is nourished by circulation\u2014by borrowing and trading, by unconscious influence or wholesale appropriation. Through the accidents of discourse, a body of theory can also be dislodged and pressed into the service of a quite different one, reinvested with unpredicted content, and refimetioned for unexpected vocations. Not least among such transactions is that between architecture and philosophy, provided we understand that coupling in an expanded sense to include urbanism, semiology, Ideologiekritik, and certain strains of poststructuralist thought; for it is that fusion (what we now call, simply, architecture theory) that, since the mid 1960s, has so energized architectural discourse in academic and professional circles, turning us away from an earlier functionalist, empiricist, foundationalist way of thinking and toward new registers of signification. By the 1980s, architecture theory had discovered affinities with other branches of theory and developed concerns with textual strategies, constructions of subjectivity and gender, power and property, geopolitics, and other themes that were already part of the general poststructuralist repertoire but whose spatial dimension was now foregrounded. This entailed that the emphasis on the production of architectural objects (which aimed to prescribe normative standards for design and layout methods and motives for implementation) should give way to an emphasis on the production of architecture as a subject of knowledge. Theory took on the task of revealing the unintended ideological presumptions that architectural procedures and techniques alternately enabled or tried to remove from the possibility of thinking, which is to say x [] Foreword that theory understood architecture as one of culture\u2019s primary representational systems. The concern with the specific internal workings of architecture\u2014which tend to be mainly synchronic, synthetic, and projective\u2014was not abandoned so much as folded into various discourses of context and exteriority, recalibrated according to what was sayable or thinkable in the idiolects of Marxism, de construction, psychoanalysis, and other imported systems. But these systems were not merely yoked together with architecture. Rather, something of a shift of level, as much as perspective, took place, in which architecture\u2019s specific forms, operations, and practices could now more clearly be seen as producing concepts whose ultimate horizon of effect lay outside architecture \u201cproper,\u201d in a more general sociocultural field. This new activity of theory demanded not new ideas for buildings but the invention of altogether new techniques for rethinking issues of representation, foundation, subjectivity, structure and ornament, materiality, media, and more. What used to be called philosophy, then, began to think its problems through architecture rather than the other way around. And this inevitably attracted some of the most important thinkers of our time (including Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Fredric Jameson) to ponder architectural problems. There has rarely been a sustained conversation between a philosopher and an architect of the scope and focus that we have here. Then again, a certain horizontality of thought, along with the desire to interpret the totality, seems demanded by our current situation. For all the apparently wild multiplicity of our present system of objects, there is also the constant magnetic pull of the single global market and a corporate controlled re totalization of all the dispersed vocations and functions of social life into a single space time of consumption and communication. Our different day to day activities are no longer tied to determinate needs or to specific exchanges between people and objects, but rather to a total universe of signs and simulacra floating in economic and cultural informational fluids. Even the conscious ideologies of rebellion and negative critique seem to be not so much co opted by the system as a strategic part of the system\u2019s internal workings. At certain moments, in certain singular objects, architecture itself produces the perception of this conflictedly overdetermined situation; architecture becomes a kind of precipitate of the vapor that we used to call the social. The twinness of the World Trade Center, for example\u2014a building that was a replica of itself\u2014was already, in the 1960s when the towers were built, an anticipatory sign of the computerized, genetically networked, cloning society that was emerging. In the next decade, the Centre Pompidou, even more deeply conflicted, signals the catastrophic finishing off of mass culture by the masses themselves: a new breed of cultural consumer who is also, along with the paintings and the cash, both the raw material and the product of the new museum. And then the architecture of our own time (the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, perhaps, one of infinite possible clones or chimeras spun out of a software package) seems to become altogether virtual, for an audience that is everyone and everywhere\u2014not so much an architectural readymade (in the sense of Duchamp) as an architecture already made, a transparent cutout that is its own template. In their conversation, Baudrillard and Nouvel turn over and over again possible ways of understanding this situation and its agents, mapping it through the languages of architecture, philosophy, and both together (and it is fascinating to register the slippages of perspective between the architect and the philosopher, to compare how the mind feels performing work on the problem one way and then the other, but also to become aware of the preference that both have for a description of the totality over the separate, abstract parts). But the provocations, responses, and probes are not meant to prtciser the ways in which architecture simply replicates the base and superstructure apparatus of which it is a primary organ (the code words for such ideological reproduction include \u201cscreen architecture\u201d and \u201cclone architecture,\u201d but also the neutral and the global). Baudrillard and Nouvel search also for some autonomous force or effect produced by the object not in culture but xii [] Foreword alongside it, in the penumbra of culture, a force that thickens the situation, obscures the scene, and gums up the hegemonic workings of visibility and transparency. This attribute of the object is alternately called its \u201csecret,\u201d its \u201cradicality,\u201d its \u201cliterality,\u201d or indeed its singularity. But dearly this is an apprehension of the singular object quite the reverse of any that would fixate on aesthetic properties to the exdusion of larger, \u201cextrinsic\u201d factors. Rather, the singular object is the way of access, through the coils of contradiction, to be sure, but nevertheless opening onto the determining conditions of its own cultural surround. Take Nouvel\u2019s own work, which has famously found its identity in a logic of the surface. On the one hand, from the earliest stone facades to the steel and glass curtain wall, architecture has always played a game of contradiction with mass and gravity and their dematerialization into surface. On the other hand, from our present perspective, the logic of the surface is a perceptual logic we must now understand as having been given to us by consumer communication culture and its slick advertising two dimensionality. \u201cScreen architecture\u201d? \u201cClone architecture\u201d? Or singular object. It is the particular handling of the surface that must make a difference. As Nouvel has commented on his Cartier Foundation: \u201cIf I look at the facade, since it\u2019s bigger than the building, I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m looking at the reflection of the sky or at the sky through the glass_If I look at a tree through the three glass panes, I can never determine if I\u2019m looking at the tree through the glass, in front of it, behind it, or the reflection of the tree. And when I plant two trees in parallel, even accidentally, to the glass plane, I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s a second tree or if it\u2019s a real tree.\u201d For Baudrillard, this form of illusion is not gratuitous; in his essay \u201cTruth or Radicality in Architecture,\u201d he referred to it as a \u201cdramaturgy of illusion and seduction.\u201d Such destabilizations of perception thwart the dictatorship of the smoothly visible and install an alternative perception, a \"secret image,\u201d an almost bodily recalcitrance (Barthes\u2019s punctum is mentioned as a model), which will make itself felt as a kind of resistance, lag, or refraction beneath the transparency. An object both of Foreword [] xiK a culture and the culture\u2019s biggest threat, then: pained by the loss, anticipating the gain, a representation of the moment and a momentary refusal. The singular object is deeply conflicted, and the conversation here takes on its subject\u2019s form. We can\u2019t go on; we must go on. The architect stretching to imagine what it would take to actually make a singular object, the philosopher insisting that no intention, no amount of individual effort, can guarantee singularity\u2019s arrival (\u201clet\u2019s not think too much\u201d). Both against premature clarification: I know it\u2019s here, but I can\u2019t see it; \u201cthe important thing is to have looked.\u201d Rarely can so many conflicting things be said about a singular subject. Rarely has such conflict been so productive. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the Maison des \u00a3crivains and the University of Paris VI La Villette School of Architecture for taking the initiative to sponsor a conference between architects and philosophers. The project, titled Urban Passages, involved a series of six encounters between writers and architects in 1997 and 1998, which made headlines both inside and outside the school. The extended dialogue between Jean Baudrillard and Jean Nouvel forms the basis of the present text. The five other pairs of participants were Paul Chemetov and Didier Daeninckx, Henri Gaudin and Jean Pierre Vernant, Philippe Sollers and Christian de Portzamparc, Antoine Grumbach and Antoine Bailly, and Henri Ciriani and Olivier Rolin. H6l\u00a3ne Bleskine developed the idea for Urban Passages and organized the dialogues. We are grateful for the opportunity to hold discussions of such quality, since it is through speech that we communicate to others the singularity of an encounter. When it came time to publish the book, the authors reworked their dialogue, focusing on a recurrent theme of the discussions: singularity. This theme helped drive the discussions toward their resolution or, we should say, toward their radical and necessary incompletion. xv / First Interview Radicality Jean Baudrillard: We can\u2019t begin with nothing because, logically, nothingness is the culmination of something. When I think of radicality, I think of it more in terms of writing and theory than of architecture. I am more interested in the radicality of space_____But it\u2019s possible that true radicality is the radicality of nothingness. Is there a radical space that is also a void? The question interests me because now, at last, I have an opportunity to gain insight into how we can fill a space, how we can organize it by focusing on something other than its radical extension\u2014vertically or horizontally, that is\u2014within a dimension where anything is possible. Yet we still need to produce something real____The question I want to ask Jean Nouvel, since we have to start somewhere, is very simple: \u201cIs there such a thing as architectural truth?\u201d Jean Nouvel: What do you mean by \u201ctruth\u201d? a 4 [] First Interview J.B. Architectural truth isn\u2019t a truth or a reality in the sense that architecture might exhaust itself in its references, its finalities, its destination, its modes, its procedures. Doesn\u2019t architecture transcend all of that, effectively exhausting itself in something else, its true finality, or something that would enable it to go beyond its true finality____Does architecture exist beyond this limit of the real? Singular Objects in Architecture J.B. I\u2019ve never been interested in architecture. I have no specific feelings about it one way or the other. I\u2019m interested in space, yes, and in anything in so called \u201cconstructed\u201d objects that enables me to experience the instability of space. I\u2019m most interested in buildings like Bea.ubourg, the World Trade Center, Biosphere 2\u2014singular objects, but objects that aren\u2019t exactly architectural wonders as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s not the architectural sense of these buildings that captivates me but the world they translate. If I examine the truth of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, for example, I see that, in that location, architecture expresses, signifies, translates a kind of full, constructed form, the context of a society already experiencing hyperrealism. Those two towers resemble two perforated bands. Today we\u2019d probably say they\u2019re clones of each other, that they\u2019ve already been cloned. Did they anticipate our present? Does that mean that architecture is not part of reality but part of the fiction of a society, an anticipatory illusion? Or does architecture simply translate what is already there? That\u2019s why I asked, \u201cIs there such a thing as architectural truth?\u201d in the sense that there would be a suprasensible destination for architecture and for space. J.N. Before answering your question, I would just like to comment that this dialogue provides a unique opportunity to discuss architecture in other than the customary terms. You know that I consider you to be the one intellectual who is actually doing his job. You respond to the many disturbing questions, the real questions, with questions and answers that no First Interview [] 5 one wants to hear. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to provoke any responses in a field that you daim to be unfamiliar with, that doesn\u2019t really interest you, but this evening I\u2019m going to try. Recently I had a look at some of your books, and I was pleased to find that you never speak about architecture except in an interview that took place twelve years ago between us. It\u2019s in that interview that I discovered a number of your ideas about architecture, aside from your writing on New York or Beaubourg. I took notes on some of your thoughts about our architectural monstrosities and some of your more radical points of view, which could supply us with a number of questions. If we attempt to talk about architecture as a limit\u2014and that\u2019s what really interests me\u2014we do so by always positioning ourselves on the fringe of knowledge and ignorance. That\u2019s the true adventure of architecture. And that adventure is situated in a real world, a world that implies a consensus. You said, somewhere, that a consensus must exist in order for seduction to occur. Now, the field of architecture is a field that, by the very nature of things, revolves around a world of seduction. The architect is in a unique situation. He\u2019s not an artist in the traditional sense. He\u2019s not someone who meditates in front of a blank page. He doesn\u2019t work on a canvas. I often compare the architect to the film director, because we have roughly the same limitations. We\u2019re in a situation where we have to produce an object within a given period of time, with a given budget, for a specific group of individuals. And we work as a team. We\u2019re in a situation where we can be censored, directly or indirectly, for reasons of safety or money, or even because of deliberate censorship. It\u2019s a field where there are professional censors. We could even call an architect who designs buildings in France a \u201cFrench building censor.\u201d It\u2019s exactly the same thing. We are situated in an environment that is bound, limited. Within that environment, where can we find an unrestricted space and the means to overcome those limitations? In my case, I\u2019ve looked for it in the articulation of various things, especially the formulation of a certain way of thinking. So should I use the word \u201cconcept\u201d or not? I used it very early 6 [] First Interview on, realizing that the word is philosophically appropriate. Then we may want to introduce the terms \u201cpercept\u201d and \u201caffect,\" in reference to Deleuze, but that\u2019s not the real problem. The problem lies in our ability to articulate a project around a preliminary concept or idea, using a very specific strategy that can synergize\u2014or sometimes even juxtapose\u2014perceptions that will interact with one another and define a place we are unfamiliar with. We are still dealing with invention, the unknown, risk. This unfamiliar place, if we succeed in figuring out what\u2019s going on, could be the locus of a secret. And it might, assuming that's the case, then convey certain things, things we cannot control, things that are fatal, voluntarily uncontrolled. We need to find a compromise between what we control and what we provoke. All the buildings I\u2019ve tried to build until now are based on the articulation of these three things. They also refer to a concept that I know interests you, the concept of illusion. Illusion, Virtuality, Reality J.N. I\u2019m no magician, but I try to create a space that isn\u2019t legible, a space that works as the mental extension of sight. This seductive space, this virtual space of illusion, is based on very precise strategies, strategies that are often diversionary. I frequently use what I find around me, including your own work and that of a few others. I also make use of cinema. So when I say that I play with depth of field, it\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to foreground a series of filters that could lead anywhere\u2014a kind of metanarrative\u2014 but from that point on, the intellect goes into action. This is not entirely my invention. Look at the Japanese garden. There is always a vanishing point, the point at which we don\u2019t know whether the garden stops or continues. I\u2019m trying to provoke that sort of response. If we look at the phenomenon of perspective\u2014I\u2019m thinking of the project for superimposing a grid on the horizon, which I had prepared for La T\u00a3te Defense\u2014I was attempting to step outside Alberti\u2019s logic. In other words, I was trying to organize all the elements in such a way that they could be read in series and, if need be, to play with scale using the series\u2019 rhythm, so First Interview [] 7 the viewer would become conscious of the space. What happens if I escape those limits? What if I say that the building isn\u2019t between the horizon and the observer but is part of that horizon? Assuming this, what happens if it loses its materiality? Dematerialization is something that would interest you; the \u201cendless skyscraper\u201d is one example. [Nouvel\u2019s project for a Tour sans fin, or \u201cendless skyscraper,\u201d was designed for La Defense, just outside central Paris. Although his design won an international competition, the building was never constructed.] Again, this isn\u2019t something I invented. I think Deleuze, in Proust and Signs, spoke about it from a different point of view. This diversion, which reroutes our perception of phenomena from the material to the immaterial, is a concept that architecture should appropriate for itself. Using these kinds of concepts, we can create more than what we see. And this \u201cmore than what we see\u201d is manifest in and through physical context. With respect to what architecture has borrowed from cinema, the concept of sequence is very important, as Paul Virilio reminds us. In other words, concepts such as displacement, speed, memory seen in terms of an imposed trajectory, or a known trajectory, enable us to compose an architectural space based not only on what we see but on what we have memorized as a succession of sequences that are perceived to follow one another. From this point on, there are contrasts between what is created and what was originally present in our perception of space. In the Versailles Theater, you enter through a stone corridor, which is absolutely neutral, plain, devoid of decoration, and which opens suddenly into something absolutely stunning in terms of its decoration, its preciosity. The period in which this theater was designed, imagined, realized provides us with a key to the phenomenon I have been describing. We\u2019re no longer in the same place today, however. We need to put those ideas aside and make use of others\u2014ideas like contrast, chaining, and extension\u2014to serve as fundamental concepts of the architectural project. At the same time, when I play with the concept of a virtual space, in the magician\u2019s sense, it\u2019s because space and architecture are things we become conscious of through our 8 0 Flrstlaterview eyes. So we can play with anything the eye can integrate through sight, and we can fool the eye. Classical culture has often made use of this kind of sleight of hand. In a building like the Cartier Foundation, where I intentionally blend the real image and the virtual image, it signifies that within a given plane, I no longer know if I\u2019m looking at the virtual image or the real image. If I look at the facade, since it\u2019s bigger than the building, I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m looking at the reflection of the sky or the sky through the glass____If I look at a tree through the three glass planes, I can never determine if I\u2019m looking at the tree through the glass, in front of it, behind it, or the reflection of the tree. And when I plant two trees in parallel, even accidentally, to the glass plane, I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s a second tree or if it\u2019s a real tree. These are gimmicks, things we can put into our bag of tricks, our architectural bag of tricks, and which we\u2019re never supposed to talk about, but which, from time to time, must be talked about. These are the means by which architecture creates a virtual space or a mental space; it\u2019s a way of tricking the senses. But it\u2019s primarily a way of preserving a destabilized area. A Destabilized Area? J.N. When you talk to a developer, the way a director talks to a producer, he asks a ton of questions about the price per square meter, the lot, can it be built on, will it shock the local bourgeoisie, a whole series of questions of this type. And then there are those things that remain unsaid. There is always something unsaid; that\u2019s part of the game. And what remains unsaid is, ethically, something additional, something that doesn\u2019t run counter to what is being sold or exchanged, doesn\u2019t interfere with our notions of economics, but signifies something vital. That\u2019s where the game is played. Because if an architectural object is only the translation of some functionality, if it\u2019s only the result of an economic situation, it can\u2019t have meaning. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s a passage in one of your texts on New York that I like very much, where you say that the city embodies a form of architecture that is violent, brutal, immediate, which is the true form of architecture, that you have no need for eco architecture or gen first Interview [] g teel architecture because that would impede life\u2019s energy. What I\u2019m saying doesn\u2019t necessarily contradict that. But since we\u2019re not always in New York, we need to set aside places, areas that can be destabilized. J.B. I agree, except perhaps about terms like \u201cconsensus.\u201d... When you say that seduction is consensual, I\u2019m skeptical. i.N. You mean only with reference to architecture? J.B. Precisely. It\u2019s a way of confronting it through the visible and the Invisible. I don\u2019t talk much about architecture, but in all my books, the question lies just beneath the surface__I fully agree with this idea of invisibility. What I like very much in your work is that we don\u2019t see it, things remain invisible, they know how to make themselves invisible. When you stand in front of the buildings, you see them, but they\u2019re invisible to the extent that they effectively counteract that hegemonic visibility, the visibility that dominates us, the visibility of the system, where everything must be immediately visible and immediately interpretable. You conceive space in such a way that architecture simultaneously creates both place and nonplace, is also a nonplace in this sense, and thus creates a kind of apparition. And it\u2019s a seductive space. So I take back what I said earlier: Seduction isn\u2019t consensual. It's dual. It must confront an object with the order of the real, the visible order that surrounds it. If this duality doesn\u2019t exist\u2014if there\u2019s no interactivity, no context\u2014seduction doesn\u2019t take place. A successful object, in the sense that it exists outside its own reality, is an object that creates a dualistic relation, a relation that can emerge through diversion, contradiction, destabilization, but which effectively brings the so called reality of a world and its radical illusion face to face. Concept, Irresolution, Vertigo J.B. Let\u2019s talk about radicality. Let\u2019s talk about the kind of radical exoticism of things that S\u00a3galen discusses, the estrangement from a sense of identity that results in the creation of a form 10 [] First Interview of vertigo through which all sorts of things can occur: affects, concepts, prospects, whatever, but always something insoluble, something unresolved. In this sense, yes, architectural objects, or at least yours or others that are even more undomesticated, are part of an architecture without a referent. This reflects their quality of being \u201cunidentified,\u201d and ultimately unidentifiable, objects. This is one area where we can combine\u2014and not merely by deliberate analogy\u2014writing, fiction, architecture, and a number of other things as well, obviously, whether this involves the analysis of a society, an event, or an urban context. I agree that we can\u2019t choose the event, we can only choose the concept, but we retain the right to make this choice. The choice of a concept is something that should conflict with the context, with all the significations (positive, functional, etc.) a building can assume, or a theory, or anything else. Deleuze defined the concept as something antagonistic. However, with respect to the event, as it is given, as it is seen, as it is deciphered, overdetermined by the media or other voices, by information, the concept is that which creates the nonevent. It creates an event to the extent that it juxtaposes the so called \u201creal\u201d event with a theoretical or fictional nonevent of some sort. I can see how this can happen with writing, but I have a much harder time with architecture. In your work, I feel it in the effect produced by this illusion you spoke of earlier; not in the sense of an illusion or a trompe l\u2019oeil\u2014well, ultimately, yes, of course, but not an illusion in the sense of a simulation\u2014of something that takes place beyond the reflection of things or beyond the screen. Today we are surrounded by screens. In fact, it\u2019s rare to succeed in creating a surface or place that doesn\u2019t serve as a screen and can exert all the prestige of transparency without the dictatorship. I\u2019d like to make a distinction here regarding our terminology. Illusion is not the same as the virtual, which, in my opinion, is complicit with hyperreality, that is, the visibility of an imposed transparency, the space of the screen, mental space, and so on. Illusion serves as a sign for anything else. It seems to me that everything you do, and do well, is another architecture First Interview [] 11 I /\"~ seen through a screen. Precisely because to create something like an inverse universe, you must completely destroy that sense of fullness, that sense of ripe visibility, that oversignification we impose on things. And here I\u2019d like to know, as part of this question of context, what happens to social and political data, to everything that can constrain things, when architecture is tempted to become the expression, or even the sociological or political transformer, of a social reality, which is an illusion\u2014in the negative sense of the term. In one sense, even if architecture wants to respond to a political program or fulfill social needs, it will never succeed because it is confronted, fortunately, by something that is also a black hole. And this black hole simply means that the \u201cmasses\u201d are still there and they are not at all recipients, or conscious, or reflected, or anything; it\u2019s an extremely perverse operator with respect to everything that is constructed. So even if architecture wants what it wants and tries to signify what it wants to express, it will be deflected. You, however, strive for this deflection and destabilization, and you\u2019re right. And as we discussed, it\u2019s going to happen anyway. This is true of politics; it\u2019s true of other categories as well. Something is present, but that something is nothing; there\u2019s nothing on the other side. Because where we see plenitude, masses, populations, statistics, and so on, there\u2019s always deflection. It's this deflection of the operator, for example, that in a work of architecture or art transforms the way we use it, but also, ultimately, transforms the meaning that was originally given to the work. And whether this resides in the work of art or in something else, at any given moment the singular object is rendered enigmatic, unintelligible even to the one who created it, which obsesses and delights us. Fortunately, this is also the reason why we can continue to live in a universe that is as full, as determined, as functional as this. Our world would be unlivable without this power of innate deflection, and this has nothing to do with sociology. On the contrary, sociology records and tallies up official behaviors before it transforms them into statistics. I\u2019m relativizing the architectural object somewhat, even though I\u2019m fully aware that when we 12 [] First Interview create something, we have to want it in some sense by saying to ourselves that even if there is no reality principle or truth principle for those for whom the object is intended, there will be a fatal deflection, there will be seduction. And we have to make sure that the things that assume they are identical to themselves or people who think they are identifying with their own character, their own genius, will be deflected, destabilized, seduced. In my opinion, seduction always takes place in this sense, in its most general form. However, I\u2019m not sure that in the virtualized world of new technologies, information, and the media, this dualistic, indecipherable relationship of seduction will take place as it did before. It\u2019s possible that the secret you spoke about would be completely annihilated by another type of universe. It\u2019s also possible that in this universe of the virtual, which we talk about today, architecture wouldn\u2019t exist at all, that this symbolic form, which plays with weight, the gravity of things and their absence, their total transparence, would be abolished. No, I\u2019m no longer sure this could occur in the virtual universe. We are completely screened in; the problem of architecture is expressed differently. So maybe there\u2019s a kind of completely superficial architecture that is confused with this universe. This would be an architecture of banality, of virtuality. It can be original as well, but it wouldn\u2019t be part of the same concept. Creation and Forgetfulness J.N. One of the big problems with architecture is that it must both exist and be quickly forgotten; that is, lived spaces are not designed to be experienced continuously. The architect\u2019s problem is that he is always in the process of analyzing the places he discovers, observing them, which isn\u2019t a normal position. What I personally like about American cities\u2014even if I wouldn\u2019t cite them as models\u2014is that you can go through them without thinking about the architecture. You don\u2019t think about the aesthetic side, with its history, and so on. You can move within them as if you were in a desert, as if you were in a bunch of other things, without thinking about this whole business of art, aesthetics, the history of art, the history of architecture. Ameri First Interview [] IB can cities enable us to return to a kind of primal scene of space. Naturally, in spite of everything, this architecture is also structured by various realities, but in terms of their actual presence, those cities, as pure event, pure object, avoid the pretense of self conscious architecture. J.B. The same is true in art, in painting. In art the strongest works are those that abandon this whole business of art and art history and aesthetics. In writing, it\u2019s the same thing. Within that overaestheticized dimension, with its pretense of meaning, reality, truth, I like it most when it is most invisible. I think that good architecture can do this as well; it\u2019s not so much a grieving process as a process of disappearance, of controlling disappearance as much as appearance. Values of Functionalism J.N. We need to recognize that we\u2019re surrounded by a great deal of accidental architecture. And an entire series of modern, or modernist, attitudes\u2014in the historical sense\u2014have been founded on this particular reality. There are countless numbers of sites whose aesthetic lacks any sense of intention. We find this same phenomenon outside of architecture; it\u2019s a value of functionalism. Today, when we look at a race car, we don\u2019t primarily think about its beauty. Nineteenth century architecture is what it is, and three quarters of the time it\u2019s not marked by any kind of aesthetic intentionality. The same applies to industrial zones at the end of the twentieth century, which are, for all intents and purposes, radical architectural forms, without concessions, abrupt, in which we can definitely locate a certain charm. But I want to get back to your ideas about architecture, since you\u2019ve definitely expressed an opinion about it. For example, you write that \u201cin architecture the situation must be looked at backwards, we need to identify a rule.\u201d You also wrote, \u201cIn architecture the accompanying idea is a strategic minimum.\u201d And \u201cNew York is the epicenter of the end of the world___As intel lectuals we must work to save that end of the world utopia.\u201d In any case, you\u2019re part of that effort. 14 [] Flrsl laterview New York or Utopia J.B. When I refer to New York as the epicenter of the end of the world, I\u2019m referring to an apocalypse. At the same time, it\u2019s a way of looking at it as a realized utopia. This is the paradox of reality. We can dream about apocalypse, but it\u2019s a perspective, something unrealizable, whose power lies in the fact that it isn\u2019t realized. New York provides the kind of stupefaction characterized by a world that is already accomplished, an absolutely apocalyptic world, but one that is replete in its verticality\u2014and in this sense, ultimately, it engenders a form of deception because it is embodied, because it\u2019s already there, and we can no longer destroy it. It\u2019s indestructible. The form is played out, it\u2019s outlived its own usefulness, it\u2019s been realized even beyond its own limits. There\u2019s even a kind of liberation, a destructuring of space that no longer serves as a limit to verticality or, as in other places, horizontality. But does architecture still exist when space has become infinitely indeterminate in every dimension? Here, in France, we\u2019ve got something different. We have a monstrous object, something insuperable, something we are unable to repeat: Beaubourg. There\u2019s nothing better than New York. Other things will happen, and we\u2019ll make the transition to a different universe, one that\u2019s much more virtual; but within its order, we\u2019ll never do better than that city, that architecture, which is, at the same time, apocalyptic. Personally, I like this completely ambiguous figure of the city, which is simultaneously catastrophic and sublime, because it has assumed an almost hieratic force. J.N. And when you write, \u201cAs intellectuals we must work to save that end of the world utopia\u201d? J.B. Do we really need to save ideas? At least we should save the possibility of a form. Of the idea as form. It\u2019s true that when faced with something that\u2019s overrealized, a terminus, we\u2019re reduced to ecstasy and pure contemplation.... It\u2019s important that we rediscover the concept in the idea, in the mental space of First Interview f] 15 / the idea. We\u2019ve got to get back insidedr go around, to the other side. Once again, perfection serves as a screen, a different type of screen. Genius would consist in destabilizing this too perfect image. TTn. You also said something rather astonishing about architecture: \u201cArchitecture is a mixture of nostalgia and extreme anticipation.\u201d Do you recall? Those ideas are still vital for me, but it\u2019s been fifteen years___Are they still vital for you? Architecture: Between Nostalgia and Anticipation J.B. We\u2019re looking for the lost object, whether we\u2019re referring to meaning or language. We use language, but it\u2019s always, at the same time, a form of nostalgia, a lost object. Language in use is basically a form of anticipation, since we\u2019re already in something else___We have to be in these two orders of reality: we have to confront what we\u2019ve lost and anticipate what\u2019s ahead of us; that\u2019s our brand of fatality. In this sense we can never clarify things, we can never say, \u201cOK, that\u2019s behind us\u201d or \u201cOK, that\u2019s ahead of us.\u201d But it\u2019s hard to understand because the idea of modernity is for all that the idea of a continuous dimension, where it\u2019s clear that the^past and the future coexist_We ourselves may no longer be in thafworld\u2014lTvvee^rer were!\u2014for it may be no more than a kind of apparition. This seems to be true for any kind of form. Form is always already lost, then always already seen as something beyond itself. It\u2019s the essence of radicality.... It involves being radical in loss, and radical in anticipation\u2014any object can be grasped in this way. My comments need to be contrasted with the idea that something could be \u201creal\u201d and that we could consider it as having a meaning, a context, a subject, an object. We know that things are no longer like that, and even the things we take to be the simplest always have an enigmatic side, which is what makes them radical. J.N. I don\u2019t want to torture you any longer, but I\u2019d like to read three other quotes: \u201cArchitecture consists in working against a background of spatial deconstruction.\u201d And \u201cAll things are 16 [] First Interview curves.\" That\u2019s a very important sentence for me. And finally \u201cProvocation would be much too serious a form of seduction.\u201d You said that in reference to architecture, by the way. (Always) Seduction, Provocation, Secrets J.B. Fortunately I haven\u2019t reread all those books. \u201cAll things are curves.\u201d That\u2019s the easiest to start with because there are no end points or the end points connect in a curved mirror. All things, in this sense, fulfill their own cycle. Provocation, seduction... Programmed seduction doesn\u2019t exist, so it doesn\u2019t mean much. Seduction should, nevertheless, contain some sense of that antagonism, that countercurrent; it should both have the sense and implement it____Here too any concerted effort at implementation is obviously contradictory. Seduction can\u2019t be programmed, and disappearance, whether of constructed things or generalized ambivalence, can\u2019t be officialized. It has to remain secret. The order of secrecy, which is the order of seduction, obviously exists only through provocation; it\u2019s almost exactly the opposite. Provocation is an attempt to make something visible through contradiction, through scandal, defiance; to make something visible that should perhaps guard its secret. The problem is to achieve this law or this rule. The rule is really the secret, and the secret obviously becomes increasingly difficult in a world like our own, where everything is given to us totally promiscuously, so that there are no gaps, no voids, no nothingness; nothingness no longer exists, and nothingness is where secrecy happens, the place where things lose their meaning, their identity\u2014not only would they assume all possible meanings here, but they would remain truly unintelligible in some sense. I think that in every building, every street, there is something that creates an event, and whatever creates an event is unintelligible. This can also occur in situations or in individual behavior; it\u2019s something you don\u2019t realize, something you can\u2019t program. You have more experience than I do with urban projects, which arrange spatial freedom, the space of freedom; all those programs are obviously absolutely contradictory. So, at bottom, the secret exists wherever people hide it. It\u2019s also possible in du alistic, ambivalent relations, for at that moment something be comes unintelligible once again, like some precious material. J.N. We can continue by talking about the aesthetics of disappearance. I\u2019d like to quote you once again, but this time not with respect to architecture, and I want to provoke you a little as well. You write, \u201cIf being a nihilist is being obsessed by the mode of disappearance rather than the mode of production, then I\u2019m a nihilist.\" You also write, \u201cI am for everything that is opposed to culture.\u201d This brings us back in a way to certain contemporary issues____I can say the same thing about architecture: I\u2019m for everything that is opposed to architecture. Twenty years ago I began a book that way: \u201cThe future of architecture is not architectural.\u201d The key is to agree on what architecture is... and where it\u2019s going. The key is to agree on what culture is and where it\u2019s going. The Metamorphosis of Architecture J.N. Architecture is pretty easy. Let me explain. One of the things I consider essential is the idea that there has been a complete change in architecture during this century, in the sense that architecture had as its initial goal the construction of the artificial world in which we live. This happened rather simply\u2014there was an independent body of knowledge, something clear, there were recipes. Vitruvius produced a book of recipes; he tells you exactly how to construct a building, the number of columns, the proportions, and so on. Academicism consisted in improving the use of these ingredients slightly. There were instructions for building cities as well; architects made use of different typologies, different recipes for urban art, et cetera. Then, suddenly, there was a shift in the demographics. You\u2019re quite familiar with this. Everyone moved to the cities, the cities exploded, we tried to maintain a certain number of rules, which were generally based on planning. These too exploded one after the other. We have experienced a kind of urban big bang and find that W2 are unable to use the existing recipes. Everything associated with those existing recipes, in other words, architecture with a capital \u201cA,\u201d has become absolutely ridiculous. As soon as you integrate a structural model into this system, it becomes absurd. So in this sense, I\u2019m against everything that is part of the same order as Architecture. This means that from this point on, we must make use of another strategy, where we\u2019re required to be slightly more intelligent\u2014to the extent that we can be\u2014required to constantly diagnose the situation, required to face the fact that architecture is no longer the invention of a world but that it exists simply with respect to a geological layer applied to all the cities throughout the planet.... Architecture can no longer have as its goal the transformation, the modification, of this accumulated material. For some, it\u2019s intolerable; they feel like they\u2019ve been fired. From the moment we initiate this discourse, however, it\u2019s as if we were against a form of ancestral culture; we throw out the baby with the bathwater. You can\u2019t generate any positive effect within this framework. Some go even further. We\u2019re faced with the generic city; that\u2019s the way it is, and there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. I suspect that you\u2019re pretty much in agreement with this type of approach, which, by the way, 1 happen to understand. Yet I\u2019ve still maintained a certain residue of optimism_I think that through small movements we can achieve an ethics whereby the situation becomes slightly more positive every time we intervene. We can try to locate a kind of enjoyment of place by including things that weren\u2019t considered previously, which are frequently accidental, and inventing strategies of improvement, the poetics of situations; we can evaluate completely random elements and declare that we\u2019re dealing with a geography: \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019m going to reveal it to you....\u201d This is an aesthetics of revelation, a way of taking a piece of the world and saying, \u201cI\u2019m appropriating this, and I\u2019m giving it back to you for your appreciation in a different way.\u201d In this century, architecture finds itself faced with incommensurable, metaphysical dimensions. A priori it can\u2019t do anything about that. It\u2019s in the same situation as philosophy or science: it\u2019s now an adult. We need to develop other strategies. At this point, we need to take into account the fatal dimensions of place, the deflection of what we\u2019re about to do, evaluate a number of possibles in terms of scenarios, and tell ourselves that what we\u2019re about to do is going to be part of a becoming that is hidden to us_____This is the opposite of the architecture that\u2019s still being taught in nine out of ten schools. It may look like an attitude against architecture, but that\u2019s not the case... just as when you wrote, rather unconditionally, \u201cI\u2019m for everything that is opposed to culture.\u201d The Aesthetics of Modernity J.B. I was referring to culture in the sense of aestheticization, and I am opposed to such aestheticization because it inevitably involves a loss: the loss of the object, of this secret that works of art and creative effort might reveal and which is something more than aesthetics. The secret can\u2019t be aesthetically unveiled. It\u2019s the kind of \u201cpunctum\u201d Barthes spoke of in reference to photography\u2014its secret, something inexplicable and nontrans missible, something that is in no way interactive. It\u2019s something that\u2019s there and not there at the same time. Within culture this thing is completely dissipated, volatilized. Culture involves the total legibility of everything in it, and what\u2019s more, it comes into being at the very moment Duchamp transposed a very simple object, the urinal, into an art object. He transposed its banality to create an event within the aesthetic universe and deaestheticize it. He forced banality upon it\u2014he broke into the home of aesthetics\u2014and stopped it cold. Paradoxically he made possible the generalized aestheticization that typifies the modern era. And I wonder whether this form of acting out on Duchamp\u2019s part, in the field of painting, which wasn\u2019t a revolution but an implosion, had an equivalent in the architectural universe. Is there a kind of before and after among forms? Here too, it\u2019s still the end of a kind of modernity, which began at the moment everything that was considered energy, or the forces of modernity\u2014whether these involved society, social wealth, industry\u2014was oriented by the idea of progress. The idea of art history in some form, of the progress of art, hung on in art. 20 [] First Interview With abstraction we had the impression that a liberation had taken place, an orgy of modernity. That all broke apart in a land of sudden implosion, a leveling of the aesthetic\u2019s sense of the sublime. And in the end, when this aesthetic of the secret disappeared, we had culture. Culture J.B. Culture is everywhere. In any case, at this point in time, it\u2019s a homologue of industry and technology. It\u2019s a mental technique, a mental technology that was embellished through architectural services, museums, et cetera. In the case of photography, I was interested in this history at one point_____When Barthes spoke about photography, he brought up the question of the \u201cpunc tum.\u201d Through this punctum, the photograph becomes an event in our head, in our mental life, where it is something different, a singular relation, an absolute singularity. This punctum, which, according to Barthes, is a nonplace, nothing, the nothingness at the heart of the photograph, disappeared, and in its place we constructed a museum of photography. This death, which Barthes said was the heart of the photograph, the photograph itself, the symbolic power of the photograph, disappeared, it assumed the shape of a monument or a museum, and this time a concrete death materialized. This was a cultural operation, and that operation, yes, I am against it, emphatically, with no concessions, without compromise. We are stuck in an unlimited, metastatic development of culture, which has heavily invested in architecture. But to what extent can we judge it? Today it\u2019s very difficult to identify, in a given building, what belongs to this secret, this singularity that hasn\u2019t really disappeared. I think that as a form it is indestructible but is increasingly consumed by culture. Is any voluntary, conscious resistance possible? Yes. I think that each of us can resist. But it would be difficult for such resistance to become political. I don\u2019t get the impression there could be any organized political resistance as such. It would always be an exception, and whatever you do will always be \"exceptional\u201d in that sense. A work of art is a singularity, and all these singularities can First Interview [] 21 create holes, interstices, voids, et cetera, in the metastatic fullness of culture. But I don\u2019t see them coalescing, combining into a kind of antipower that could invest the other. No. We are definitively immersed in the order of culture, that is, until the apocalypse arrives. We can, I think, combine all this within the same concept. I think that even political economy in the form it has assumed, which is also completely skewed, and which is not at all a principle of economic reality but one of pure speculation, a political economy that culminates in a speculative void, is an aesthetic. Now, Walter Benjamin already analyzed this in the field of politics. In that sense, we are witnessing an aestheticiza tion of behavior and structure. But aestheticization is not part of the real; on the contrary, it signifies that things are becoming values, assume value. We can no longer compare an interplay of forms. It\u2019s unintelligible and can\u2019t be assigned any ultimate meaning, because it\u2019s a game, a rule, something different. With generalized aestheticization, forms are exhausted and become value. But value, aesthetics, culture, et cetera, are infinitely negotiable, and everyone can benefit, although here we are within the domain of order and equivalence, the complete leveling of all singularity. I believe we are part of that order, from which nothing can escape. But I also still feel that singularities as such can function even though they assume what are frequently monstrous forms\u2014for example, those \u201cmonsters\u201d you spoke about. What interests me is architecture as monster, those objects that have been catapulted into the city, from someplace else. In a way I appreciate this monstrous character. The first was Beaubourg. We could provide a cultural description of Beaubourg, consider Beaubourg as the synthesis of this total \u201cculturization,\u201d and, in this case, be completely opposed to it. Nonetheless the Beaubourg object is a singular event in our history, a monster. And it is a monster because it demonstrates nothing, it\u2019s a monster, and in that sense a land of singularity. It\u2019s obvious that such objects, whether architectural or not, escape their programmed existence, the future you have given them_____This metamorphosis can become a singular personal intuition or the result of an overall effect that no one intended. 22 [] First Interview Still, the object (architectural or not) in question will produce a gaping hole in this culturally. A Heroic Architectural Act? J.N. We might ask ourselves why there is no equivalent to Duchamp in the world of architecture. There is no equivalent because there is no auto architecture. There is no architect who could make an immediate, scandalous gesture that was accepted. Architects have tried to confront these limits\u2014that was the starting point of postmodernity. We could say that in his own way, Venturi tried to do it. He took the simplest building that existed, a basic building from the suburbs of Philadelphia\u2014even the location wasn\u2019t important, it was the least significant location possible\u2014made of brick, with standard windows, and so on, and he said: \u201cThis is the architecture we must make today.\u201d And his gesture implied an entire theory, a theory that was opposed to the heroic architectural act, although in terms of derision it was a \u201cweak\u201d application of the dadaist revolution (on the Richter scale, it was one or two; Duchamp is seven). But all these attempts culminated in notable failures, since we as architects are unable to attain the same distance from the object. I have no idea what would enable us to identify Duchamp\u2019s fountain if it weren\u2019t in a museographic space. It demands certain reading conditions and a certain distance, which don\u2019t exist for architecture. At most we could say that this act of complete vulgarization might occur in spite of the client\u2019s intentions. The only problem is that if you do that and you repeat it, it becomes insignificant. No further reality, no further reading of the act is possible; you\u2019ve become part of the total disappearance of the architectural act. J.B. Duchamp\u2019s act also becomes insignificant, wants to be insignificant, wants insignificance, and becomes insignificant in spite of itself through repetition, as well as through all of Duchamp\u2019s by products. The event itself is unique, singular, and that\u2019s the end of it. It\u2019s ephemeral. Afterward there\u2019s a whole string of them, in art as well, since from that moment on, the path was cleared first Interview [] 23 for the resurgence of earlier forms; postmodernism, if you like. The moment simply existed. Art, Architecture, and Postmodernity J.N. So can this debate about contemporary art\u2014\u201cit\u2019s junk, worthless\u201d\u2014be applied to architecture? Can it be extrapolated? J.B. I\u2019d like to ask you the same thing. J.N. I\u2019d say that the search for limits and the pleasure of destruction are part of both art and architecture. You were talking about the idea of destruction as something that can be positive. This search for a limit, this search for nothingness, almost nothingness, takes place within the search for something positive; that is, we\u2019re looking for the essence of something. This search for an essence reaches limits that are near the limits of perception and the evacuation of the visible. We no longer experience pleasure through the eye but through the mind. A white square on a white background is a type of limit. James Turrel is a type of limit. Does that mean it\u2019s worthless? In the case of James Turrel, you enter a space, and it\u2019s monochromatic. Is it one step further than Klein? Is that why you\u2019re fascinated? You know there\u2019s nothing there, you feel there\u2019s nothing there, you can even pass your hand through it, and you\u2019re fascinated by the object in a way because it\u2019s the essence of something. Once he\u2019s given us the keys to his game, he does the same thing with a square of blue sky. He\u2019s currently working on the crater of a volcano, where, when you lie down at the bottom of the crater, you can see the perfect circle of the cosmos. All of these ideas are based on a certain search for the limit of nothingness. So when you leave the Venice Biennale, realizing that this search for nothingness has ended in worthlessness, that\u2019s a critical judgment I can share in 80 percent of the cases. However, the history of art has always consisted of a majority of minor works. J.B. This search for nothingness is, on the contrary, the aestheti cized fact of wanting this nothingness to have an existence, a 24 [] First Interview value, and even, at some point, a surplus value, without considering the market, which soon takes control of it. It\u2019s the opposite in one sense___Duchamp\u2019s gesture was to reduce things to insignificance. In a way, he\u2019s not responsible for what happened afterward. So when other artists take possession of this \u201cnothingness\u201d or, through this nothingness, take possession of banality, waste, the world, the real world, and they transfigure the banal reality of the world into an aesthetic object, it\u2019s their choice, and it\u2019s worthless in that sense, but it\u2019s also annoying, because I would rather associate an aura with worthlessness, with \u201cnothingness\u201d This nothingness is in fact something. It\u2019s what hasn\u2019t been aestheticized. It\u2019s what, one way or another, can\u2019t be reduced to any form of aestheticization. Rather, it\u2019s this highly focused strategy of nothingness and worthlessness that I am opposed to. The difference between Warhol and the others, who did the same thing\u2014although it isn\u2019t the same thing\u2014is based on the fact that he takes an image and reduces it to nothing. He uses the technical medium to reveal the insignificance, the lack of objectivity, the illusion of the image itself. And then other artists make use of the technique to re create an aesthetic in other technological media, through science itself, through scientific images. They reproduce the aesthetic. They do exactly the opposite of what Warhol was able to do, they reaestheticize the technique, while Warhol, through technique, revealed technique itself as a radical illusion. Here the term \u201cworthlessness\u201d is ambivalent, ambiguous. It can refer to the best or the worst. Personally, I assign great importance to worthlessness in the sense of nothingness, in the sense that, if we achieve this art of disappearance, we\u2019ve achieved art, whereas all the strategy used to manage most of the stuff we\u2019re shown\u2014where there\u2019s usually nothing to see in any event\u2014serves precisely to convert that worthlessness into spectacle, into aesthetic, into market value, into a form of complete unconsciousness, the collective syndrome of aestheticization known as culture. We can\u2019t say it\u2019s all the same, but the exceptions can only be moments. For me, Duchamp is one of them; Warhol is another. But there are other singularities, Francis First litervlew [] 25 Bacon, perhaps, maybe others. But it\u2019s not a question of names of artists__It can never be anything but a onetime event that affects us in this world saturated with values and aesthetics. From that moment on, there is no more history of art. We see that art\u2014and this is one aspect of its worthlessness\u2014with its retrograde history, exhausts itself in its own history trying to resuscitate all those forms, the way politics does in other areas. It's a form of regression, an interminable phase of repetition during which we can always bring back any older work of art, or style, or technique as a fashion or aesthetic\u2014a process of endless recycling. J.N. Couldn\u2019t we say that the twentieth century has seen a surfeit of art? Because during the century, any artist who managed to define a formal field has become a great artist? All it takes is a bit of ash on a leaf. All it takes is the ability to experience something with respect to the ash, to contextualize it, distance it, and the concept appears____The artist who has succeeded in find ing his field has become identifiable, gets noticed, has a market value, et cetera. This has been a century of gigantic exploration: exploration of the real, exploration of sensations, of everything around us, a search for sensation. Some succeeded; others didn\u2019t. All of this was then mixed up with meaning and with conceptual art. When Laurence Wiener hangs a sentence in space without touching it, whatever happens, happens as part of the relation between the sentence and the space. It\u2019s not a big deal, but it\u2019s a field in and of itself. We\u2019ve lived through this gigantic exploration. Everyone can find their value system, has experienced events, facts, modes, and interactions that sometimes resulted in arte povera, or pop art, or conceptual art, et cetera. But all that exploration kept getting extended further, and everyone is looking for whatever they can grab. Does this mean that all this exploration is part of that \u201cworthlessness\u201d? J.B. Well, there may be a history of art that\u2019s not progressive but which deepens the analytic side of art, and all abstraction is still a reduction of the visible world, of the object, into its 26 [] First Interview microelements. It\u2019s a way of returning to a primal geometry. It\u2019s exactly the same thing as the search for analytic truth in the social sciences. It\u2019s the same kind of process. We\u2019ve gone from the evidence of appearances to the fundamental fractal nature of things. This is the history of abstraction, and this search leads directly into another dimension, which is no longer that of appearance or a strategy of appearances, but of a need centered on in depth analytic knowledge of the object and the world, which, in a sense, puts an end to sense relations. It\u2019s the extermination of the sensible, but it still constitutes a search, I agree. Once we\u2019ve arrived at this point, however, it\u2019s over.... We have an artificial reconstruction of evidence, of perception, but the crucial act, the determining factor, is abstraction. Afterward we\u2019re no longer really in a world of forms; we\u2019re in a microworld. Art even anticipated scientific discovery; it went deeper and deeper into the fractal world, into geometry. I don\u2019t mean that all sensibility, all perception, disappeared. It\u2019s always possible for anyone, any object, to have a singular relation but not an aesthetic one, to have a primitive relation, something to do with this punctum, anyone can experience that______So called aesthetic mediation is over with. The artist is someone who exploits the domain of singularity so that he can appropriate it and use it interactively both through the market structure and through a number of other things as well. But the dualistic relation of any individual with any object, even the most worthless, is singular, it retains its power, and it can be rediscovered. I don\u2019t feel that this has been lost; that\u2019s not the problem with the sensible, the fatal. By this I mean that the fatal relation with things, with appearances, can be rediscovered, but if it is, today that discovery will be in conflict with aesthetics, with art. In the same sense, you can rediscover a dualistic relation in society, in other domains, in alterity. But this doesn\u2019t take place through politics, or economics; those things are behind us, they have their history, and we are in another world where those mediating structures have either monopolized the entire market, and at that point should be destroyed, or have already destroyed First Interview [] 27 themselves. By the way, that\u2019s what I meant when I said that \u201cart is worthless.\u201d Visual Disappointment, Intellectual Disappointment J.N. Aren\u2019t you as disappointed visually as you are intellectually? In your writing, you tell your readers that you would prefer to be deaf than blind, and just how important sight is for you. But paradoxically one has the impression that a certain amount of vacuity or disappearance might interest you. Isn\u2019t it with respect to the voyeur, or observer, in you that you believe the art object is vacuous? Doesn\u2019t [Robert] Ryman, doesn\u2019t [Ad] Reinhardt, disappoint your senses before disappointing you intellectually? J.B. I agree with you completely. Seen from another viewpoint, it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t believe there is any relation whatsoever between an image and a text, between writing and the visual. If there is an affinity, it would occur through a more secretive network than anything we perceive, by fortuitous correspondences, as has always been the case. Image and text are two singular registers; we need to maintain their singularity. The same thing can be represented in either way; the interplay of forms can be represented in either of them, but they can\u2019t ever be correlated. For me, something of the fantastic remains in the image. Any image retains something of the savage and fantastic. What I would like is that it retain that character. But today images have been aes theticized, they have become increasingly virtualized, they are no longer images. Television is the opposite of the image: there are no images on television. Yes, I\u2019m visually disappointed, and painting has exactly the same effect on me. To me they*re digitally synthesized images, technically and mentally, but they\u2019re no longer images. Once again the possibility exists to re create the primal scene, the original savagery of the image, but starting from nothing, any intuition, in the literal sense of the term, can re create the image. For example, this punctum, this secret associated with the image, I sometimes find it in photography. So we\u2019re not desperate. But the disappointment in the contextual 28 [] First Interview universe that surrounds us, with images bombarding us from every side, yes, I resent that. J.N. I have the impression that the sense of something\u2019s being \u201cworthless, worthless, worthless\u201d in architecture also exists! It is just as overwhelming but, paradoxically, perhaps for the opposite reason. That is to say, what characterizes this worthless architecture today, three quarters of the time, is the \u201cpicturesque.\u201d Or it\u2019s the extension of a private model of meaning and sensibility. One of the current dramas in architecture is modeling, cloning. Often we don\u2019t know what to do; the context is hopeless. Not only the geographic, urban context, but the human context as well, the context of the commission, the financial context, everything is hopeless. And trained architects are forced to confront that reality. That reminds me of something Judd was saying, \u201cI looked in the El Paso phone book. There are twenty five hundred architects, and I\u2019ve never seen any architecture in El Paso!\u201d A great number of architects borrow a model that comes from a magazine, or a contractor or client. And at that moment, we have to identify a number of existing parameters that are reassuring, because if we do architecture, we want it to be seen, and at the same time we don\u2019t want to make waves. However, the majority of architectures produced today aren\u2019t based on those simple, clean, savage, radical rules that you talk about in your book on New York. Most of the time, they\u2019re a collage of objects, the one that presents the fewest problems either for the one who\u2019s designing it, or for the one who\u2019s receiving it, or for the builder. And for those three reasons, it\u2019s worthless, worthless, worthless. We\u2019re looking for something else. Maybe we\u2019re looking for that aesthetic of disappearance that Paul Virilio discusses. But not necessarily in the sense Virilio intends, in that virtual, informatic space where information circulates rather than humans, not in a virtual space because those objects are completely lacking in meaning. That\u2019s the primary characteristic of everything being built today, and the paradox is that the most poetic things are, on the social level, the most First Interview [] 29 dramatic. That is, the most authentic things, the truest, will be found in the cities of the South, where they are made out of necessity, but also in connection with a culture that\u2019s very much alive. These aren\u2019t objects that are parachuted in, inauthentic objects that correspond to some architectural convention. The problem of the worthlessness of architecture presents itself with at least the same acuity as in the field of art, but certainly not on the same basis. The Aesthetics of Disappearance J.B. Obviously we need to be clear about what we mean by the aesthetics of disappearance It\u2019s true that there are a thou sand ways to disappear, but we can at least compare the kind of disappearance that results in extermination\u2014which is one of the ideas underlying Paul Virilio\u2019s work\u2014and the way things disappear in a \u201cnetwork,\u201d which affects all of us and could be considered a kind of sublimation. The disappearance I\u2019m talking about, which results in the concept of worthlessness or nothingness I mentioned earlier, means that one form disappears into another. It\u2019s a kind of metamorphosis: appearance disappearance. The mechanism is completely different. It\u2019s not the same as disappearing within a network, where everyone becomes the clone or metastasis of something else; it\u2019s a chain of interlinked forms, into which we disappear, where everything implies its own disappearance. It\u2019s all about the art of disappearance. Unfortunately there\u2019s only one word to describe it, and the same is true for the term \u201cworthlessness.\u201d We can use it in different senses, just as we can the term \u201cnothingness,\u201d but no matter what happens, we enter a field of discourse that can no longer be fully explained, we\u2019ve got to play the game, we\u2019re forced to. Images of Modernity J.N. Do you still have a positive outlook on modernity? J.B. Did I ever? 30 [] First Interview J.N. You did, and you\u2019re going to jump when I tell you because it\u2019s something you wrote, and it\u2019s not nihilist at all. In fact, it\u2019s rather optimistic, since you talk about modernity as the \"activism of well being.\u201d J.B. I get the impression you\u2019re still talking about a prior life. That\u2019s pretty good!... Well being, it was an old concept even then; now I think we\u2019re beyond happiness. The problem is no longer the identification of coherence among needs, objects, all those things... upon which a certain conception of architecture also depended, by the way. That\u2019s been \u201cnullified,\u201d but in the sense of having disappeared inside a network. We no longer ask if we\u2019re happy or not. Within a network, you\u2019re simply part of the chain, and you move from one terminal to another; you\u2019re \u201ctransported,\u201d in a way, but you\u2019re not necessarily happy. The question of happiness, like that of freedom or responsibility, and a host of other questions about modernity, the ideals of modernity\u2014these are no longer really relevant, at least in terms of expecting a response. In that sense, I\u2019m no longer modern. If modernity is conceived in this way, which was to subjectively ensure\u2014whether it was the subjectivity of the individual or the group\u2014a maximum of accumulation, a maximal number of things, then modernity has overshot the goal it set for itself. Maybe it didn\u2019t fail at all, maybe it succeeded all too well, it propelled us well beyond our goal... and now all the questions are about lost objects. The Biology of the Visible J.N. Concepts of modernity in architecture are very ambiguous because they are tied to historical concepts, whereas modernity by its very nature is something vital, although today I think it is primarily concerned with the aesthetic forms of disappearance. I read \u201cEvery real thing is prepared to disappear, that\u2019s all it asks for.\u201d I feel that in the field of architecture, and, more than architecture, design in the broadest sense, we are experiencing an aesthetic of \u201csacrifice.\u201d I would say, the sacrifice of the visual. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s leading, but part of it is reflected First Interview [] 31 in miniaturization, our increasing domination of matter, with matter itself being increasingly reduced to its simplest expression. It\u2019s quite obvious that for objects like the computer, which has been miniaturized to an astounding degree, compared to the cathode ray screen, the television, it\u2019s eventually going to end up as thin as a piece of rolling paper. We can\u2019t see these things as they happen; we can only see the result. That\u2019s all we have. When we\u2019re successful, all we have is action, the means to achieve it are obliterated, they cease to be interesting. This century once looked into the mirror of a mechanistic modernity and grew excited at looking inside things\u2014motors, gears, cutaway drawings\u2014now that\u2019s over with, it no longer interests us, all we want is the result. That\u2019s a disturbing kind of miracle. J.B. You\u2019re forgetting that we\u2019re still looking inside the genetic code, trying to decode genes, et cetera. We want to make those kinds of things visible, but there\u2019s no mechanism. Whether the research takes place in the field of biology or genetics, the fantasy is the same.... I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the culmination of modernity or an excrescence. Maybe this effort to get at the analytic heart of things, this desire to reveal the interior of matter itself, until we reach those particles that, at times, are completely invisible, will eventually lead us to immateriality or, in any case, to something that can no longer be represented: particles, molecules, et cetera. Practically speaking, in biology, for us, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing, except that we\u2019ve transposed to the human all our efforts at microanalysis, fractalization, et cetera_In a way, it\u2019s modernity that has reduced itself to its most basic elements, ultimately culminating in an algebra of the invisible. J.N.... whose complexity is one of the essential paradigms. J.B. These are elements that are \u201celsewhere\u201d in the sense that they are no longer perceptible, no longer part of perception or representation. But they are not \u201celsewhere\u201d in the sense that they come from another place, in the sense that they might really represent another form, which we would have to deal with 32 [] First Interview in dualistic terms. If beings from another place were to appear, there would be a renewed possibility of interaction, but even here, no interaction is possible on the level of the code, of genetics, basic elements, et cetera. There is no more interaction. True, there is infinite combination, and we\u2019ll go as far as we can in that direction\u2014not despairingly, of course. No, quite the contrary. There\u2019s even a kind of collective fascination with the image that this reality offers us in return. But we can no longer claim that some notion of happiness or freedom will ultimately be involved, because they\u2019ve disappeared, they\u2019ve volatilized into that analytic research we\u2019ve been talking about So is that the end of modernity? A New Hedonism? J.N. We can have a more optimistic vision of things... especially once we manage to dominate matter in such a way that it enables us to resolve practical problems, problems tied to certain kinds of pleasure, even if the initial pleasure is perverted by excess_ The wireless telephone is a good example. You can call anywhere in the world from any other point in the world, just as it\u2019s possible today to press on a piece of glass and make it transparent or opaque and feel your hand warm up on contact. Everything takes place over a surface of a few millimeters Such techno logical innovations are heading in the direction of new sensations and added comfort, in the direction of new forms of pleasure. So maybe the situation isn\u2019t as desperate as all that! J.B. I wasn\u2019t talking about despair. I simply find that there is a strange attraction, a fascination with such things_Is fascina tion a form of happiness? For me it is, but it\u2019s not the happiness associated with seduction; it\u2019s something else. The vertigo that pushes us to go further and further in that direction exists, clearly, and we all share in it collectively, but we have to make sure that when we reach the boundaries of our explorations, we don\u2019t trigger processes that are completely obliterating. When we reach the micro micro, even in biology, we end up triggering viruses. They may have been there all along, but we\u2019ve managed to reactivate them, we've brought them back to life. We discovered them, but they discovered us as well, and there are all sorts of ways things can backfire, including those that lead to what may be a kind of fatal reversibility. We are no longer the masters. I don\u2019t like to play prophet, but we shouldn\u2019t believe that all these analytic advances will lead to greater control of the world, or to increased happiness. On the contrary, even science recognizes that it has less and less control over the real, the object ceases to exist\u2014at some point it simply disappears. So where do we look? OK, so it's a bit like that ideal object discussed during the Enlightenment: progress, the rights of man, and all the rest____So there we have our object. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been lost. It\u2019s still a nostalgic vision, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s come apart, it\u2019s been dispersed, when what we wanted was to force it into its ultimate reality. And in that sense it has disappeared, it\u2019s gone, although it may come back under a different form, a fatal form, in the worst sense of the word\u2014we just don\u2019t know.... What\u2019s going to happen with all the negative exponential processes that have been triggered and which we know are moving much more quickly than the positive processes? In any case, the outlook, if there is one, is one of complete ambiguity. That\u2019s truly the end of modernity. As long as modernity was able to believe that there was still a positive direction and the negative would be buried deeper and deeper in positivity, we were still very much in line with modernity. But once everything we\u2019re searching for becomes ambiguous, ambivalent, reversible, random, then modernity is over\u2014and it\u2019s just as true for politics. II Second Interview Truth in Architecture Jean Baudrfllard: Can we speak of truth in architecture? No, at least not in the sense that architecture would have truth as its goal or culmination. There are things an architecture wants to say, things it claims to accomplish, signify.... Where is the radi cality of architecture? What is it that constitutes the radicality of architecture? That\u2019s how we should pose the question of truth in architecture. That truth is to some extent what architecture is trying to achieve without wanting to say it\u2014which is a form of involuntary radicality. In other words, it\u2019s what the user makes of it, what happens to it through use, when in the grip of an uncontrollable actor. This leads me to introduce another aspect of things, which is their literality. To my mind, literality means that aside from technical progress, aside from social and historical development, the architectural object as an event that has taken place is no longer susceptible to being completely interpreted or explained. Such objects express things literally, in the sense that no exhaustive interpretation is possible. 38 [] Second Interview What does \u201cliterally\u201d mean? I\u2019ll use the example of Beaubourg again. OK, we have Beaubourg. So what does it express? Culture, communication? No, I don\u2019t think so. Beaubourg expresses flux, storage, redistribution, and Piano and Rogers\u2019s architecture expresses those things literally. What it expresses literally is almost the reverse of the message it supposedly expresses. Beaubourg represents both the fact of culture and the thing that killed culture, the thing it succumbed to, in other words, the confusion of signs, the excess, the profusion. It\u2019s this internal contradiction that translates Beaubourg\u2019s architecture, which I call its \"literality.\u201d Similarly, we can say that the World Trade Center alone expresses the spirit of New York City in its most radical form: verticality. The towers are like two perforated strips. They are the city itself and, at the same time, the vehicle by means of which the city as a historical and symbolic form has been liquidated\u2014repetition, cloning. The twin towers are clones of each other. It\u2019s the end of the city, but it\u2019s a very beautiful end, and architecture expresses both, both the end and the fulfillment of that end. That finality, which is both symbolic and real, and situated well outside the project that the architect\u2019s drawing embodied, far beyond the initial definition of the architectural object, is expressed literally. Another Tower forBeaubourg Jean Nouvel: It\u2019s worth asking if Beaubourg really signified culture___When you look at Beaubourg from within the world of architecture, you realize that it\u2019s one of the first attempts to concretize the theory of Archigram\u2019s city as machine. In a way, Beaubourg is the culmination of functionalist theories, where architecture translates the truth of the building, which is a kind of hypertruth. The skeleton is visible, with all its guts on the outside, and the nerves, everything is exposed to view, to a degree that\u2019s never been surpassed. English high tech reached a peak in the seventies, but Beaubourg is the only building that took so much of a risk, aside from the Lloyds building, perhaps, which shares the same sense of exhibitionism. Richard Rogers extended the movement to factories___But the most interest Secoad Interview [] 39 ing thing in the Beaubourg concept, originally, was the freedom within, in the way the space was conceived. We felt that this machine for housing art\u2014or hopefully for manufacturing art\u2014was going to work. Completely unpredictable events were supposed to take place within the building, the floor areas were supposed to coexist with added sections, supports, movable extensions, everything was supposed to be optimally organized within a dialectic of support supply. Beaubourg was primarily a support. But the space, subsequently made \u201cfunctional,\u201d completely altered its initial meaning. Its worth pointing out that in January 1999 an ad was designed\u2014while they were working on the restoration\u2014which for the first time completely covered the facade with an enormous photograph on canvas that was more than two hundred meters long and thirty meters high. Beaubourg\u2019s mission is to capture these exterior and interior events, events of all kinds, which are supposed to be free or of limited duration. The implosion you spoke about occurred in a completely unexpected way. The thing that was killed before it even got off the ground was the exposure to other possibilities, the play inherent in the possibilities of space, its total vacuity. The fact that they reconstructed the interior space using ordinary partitions, turning it into a space that is completely conventional, meant that Beaubourg would become the opposite of a simple architectural support, to the extent that they\u2019ve now put G strings on the beams so they appear more dignified, so they can erase any industrial or mechanical reference! Every freedom that existed within the space has been wrecked by the fire department, which insisted that the floor area, which was 150 by 50 meters\u2014which is huge!\u2014be divided by a wall. The space was simply cut in two. This alteration alone removed the necessity, and therefore the meaning, of putting the ducts on the outside\u2014they could just as well have been stuck inside the service core or between two walls. But in the beginning it was much more relevant. Everything that was supposed to interact with this support and change rapidly didn\u2019t happen, and Beaubourg is experienced as if it were a building made of dressed stone. Because it was overconsumed, because of the 40 [] Secofld Interview incredible number of visitors every year, its enormous size, the building has been exhausted very quickly. This accelerated aging is also a characteristic of the building. But it\u2019s interesting to see the enormous discrepancy between the architectural intentions and the reality. At the same time, it was Renzo Piano, one of the two architects who designed Beaubourg, who is responsible for the building\u2019s restoration\u2014if you can call it that\u2014in its current, rather than its conceptual, state. It\u2019s difficult to imagine the energy of the seventies today. J.B. Yet in its flexibility, Beaubourg did reflect its original intent. J.N. No, it hasn\u2019t played its role; the building is static. Maybe it will happen one day.... But no one wanted to play with that flexibility; it was too dangerous, too spontaneous. Everything has been reframed, resealed. Imagine a building with large windows built in 1930. The same thing would have happened then, assuming there was a large flat roof with a beautiful belvedere. Of course, its status as an urban artifact remains. Beaubourg functions as a cathedral, with its buttresses, a nave, a \u201cpiazza.\u201d It\u2019s a call to the public to come inside, to consume the views of Paris and the art. A call to consumption. A Shelter for Culture? J.B. Yes, it\u2019s also a draft of air pulling things along in its wake. And locally it\u2019s still a kind of hole, an air inlet_As for sheltering or provoking culture, I\u2019m skeptical____________How can you recap ture the subversiveness that the space seemed to call forth as it was originally designed? J.N. Can the institution accept subversion? Can it plan the unknown, the unforeseeable? Can it, within a space as open as this, provide artists with the conditions for something that is oversized, an interference; can it agree to not set limits? Architecture is one thing; human life another. What good is an architecture that is out of step with contemporary life? J.B. Still, even though we can effectively express the relationship of architecture, or a given building, to culture, to society... how are we going to define its \u201csocial\u201d impact? It\u2019s precisely the lack of a possible definition of the social that should produce an architecture of the indefinable, in other words, a real time architecture, characterized by randomness and the uncertainty that drives social life. Architecture can no longer \u201cmonumentalize\u201d anything today.... But it can\u2019t demonumentalize anything either, so what role does it play? J.N. Some people have tried to provoke this real time, random architecture. We\u2019re trying to do this in an industrial building that everyone finds hideous, although it\u2019s absolutely remarkable: a group of derelict buildings that no one wanted, a Seita factory. It\u2019s an abandoned factory complex, located in one of the most popular quarters of Marseilles, known as \u201cla Belle de mai.\u201d Eighty thousand square meters of empty space! The place was empty and unsafe. The city was handling security, and people had begun to squat in the buildings, until one day, quite spontaneously, the artists got involved\u2014people from theater, choreographers, painters and sculptors. So now there was a clear desire to create a kind of open cultural space, based on a living culture, just the opposite of the kinds of buildings that are usually reserved for culture, with scheduled hours, and designed for conservation. The place would be open day and night, the artists would live there, some would be invited as a group by producers and would have an opportunity to continue their work jointly. There was a clear mandate for the project to initiate new work, giving preference to younger artists, creators, students, the unemployed, with a very clear intercultural dimension. But this type of approach and this type of architecture have the greatest difficulty obtaining financing, and funding for maintenance and development. The contradiction is difficult to resolve because the people who start the project would prefer not to get involved in some sort of institutional operation, but they\u2019re required to ask for approval, for permission from institutions, 42 [] Secsnd lalervlew whether they involve the city or the government\u2014which reject such radicality. Nonetheless I think the project is part of the dynamic of what must become a contemporary cultural space. The hypercentralized, hyperinstitutionalized places we\u2019re surrounded with are sterile. On Modification: Mutation or Rehabilitation J.N. I think the debate going on about what I call \u201cmodification\u201d is essential. We built heavily throughout the century, very quickly, very badly, anywhere, anyhow. We produced and reproduced a number of things in record time: spaces, buildings, suburbs, and nonplaces as well. Now we\u2019re in a situation, in all the northern countries, where growth is just about over. But urban and suburban spaces, the rural landscape, et cetera, are subject to constant modification. We find ourselves with a body of architectural material\u2014things that were built, abandoned, rebuilt\u2014 which have to be modified or demolished; in any case, that\u2019s what we have to work with. It\u2019s not a question of any prior intention to conserve a certain number of signs of the past, nor of \u201crehabilitating,\u201d in the conventional sense of the term, some sort of \u201crefined bourgeois taste, the essence of the picturesque.\u201d It\u2019s about creating architecture, meaning and essence, from some raw, unworked material. If we look at what\u2019s going on in Marseilles, we see an industrial building that could be considered a cultural facility that is 80 percent complete. The simple fact of changing its use and sticking a certain number of objects inside, applying a few finishing touches, various architectural signs, alters the meaning of the place completely. To give you an example, there were large rooms 150 meters long and 40 meters wide. Before, the space was saturated with machine tools; now that it\u2019s empty, it\u2019s sumptuous. It would be impossible to create a cultural space like that from scratch today. It would cost too much. We chose to consider this interior exterior urban ensemble as a piece of the city. People live there as if it were a small city. And we feel that the architectural act revolves around settling into a repurposed architecture. This could involve something that\u2019s built inside or SecoBd Interview [] 43 on the roof or even on a terrace. Nonetheless this process of sedimentation is a form of creation and a complete qualification of the space. It\u2019s not only a modification; it\u2019s a mutation. The space is no longer experienced the same way, there are different things inside; we play with scale differently, change the meaning, and starting with what was a large, poorly defined, purely functional volume, we\u2019ve gradually managed to produce a regenerative recreation that no one would have thought possible. This process of fabricating cities today should be encouraged. It allows us to escape dimensional standards, to obtain this sense of \u201cexcess,\u201d this superfluity that is essential and unplanned. It provokes a sense of excess: too big, too high, too dark, too ugly, too stiff, unforeseen, radical. J.B. But this mutation, as you call it, is often part of a cultural plan. In fact, what we call \u201ccultural\u201d is ultimately only a bunch of polymorphous or, who knows, perverse activities! J.N. When the mutation isn\u2019t really a mutation, it becomes perverse; it becomes rehabilitation. Rehabilitation, in the legal sense of the term, is the process of providing something with qualities that had been denied to it previously. In fact, all the public housing built during the sixties and seventies has now been \u201crehabilitated,\u201d which means that they\u2019re maintained\u2014something that had been overlooked for years\u2014that someone applies a little color to the facade, a couple of awnings, and that \u201cghettoization\u201d is perpetuated by allowing the urban social fabric around them to degrade and violence to spread. We continue to promote an approach to housing that we know doesn\u2019t work, and we solidify and perpetuate all the problems we have. Moreover, to reduce costs, we contract the work out to companies who cap expenses as much as possible. The building is insulated on the outside. We pretend to make a number of improvements, when all we\u2019ve done is patched things up: we touch it up here and there, and it\u2019s good for another twenty years, even though the buildings were only designed to last twenty years when they were built. 44 [] Stand lalerview J.B. The large urban spaces that have sprung into existence without any preliminary planning, like New York\u2019s Lower East Side or Soho, have been taken over by the middle class over the past twenty years, often artists, who have changed the lifestyle and appearance of those neighborhoods: is that rehabilitation or mutation? It\u2019s easy to see that this kind of mutation is most often accompanied by a gentrification of the neighborhood, which was also the case in Salvador da Bahia, in Brazil. They saved the facades, but behind those facades, everything changed. J.N. Look at Paris, for example. This city has been characterized by what I call \u201cembalming.\u201d This consists in preserving a series of facades that have some historic value and building new structures behind them\u2014this happened in Rue Quincampoix, and in the Marais, near Saint Paul. It\u2019s obvious that this served only one purpose: to get rid of the poor who lived there and replace them with people who had the means to pay. We\u2019re well outside the framework of rehabilitation when we radically change usage and move in the direction of greater space, increased pleasure, the conquest of new qualities. Embalming is the opposite. We break up small apartments, cut the windows in two with new floors, et cetera. New York isn\u2019t exactly the same. There the industrial spaces were turned into dream apartments, unique spaces three hundred square meters in size. You can live in a building that\u2019s thirty meters deep. Once you have good lighting at either end, you can accept the fact that there are darker areas in the center, contrary to the hygienic theories favored by modernity. But what\u2019s happening in this case is more than a rehabilitation; it's also a mutation, and that mutation initiates a real shift in the way we understand a place aesthetically. In such spaces, a table, three chairs, and a bed are sufficient to create a poetics of space that differs from what it was when it was saturated with merchandise and machinery. J.B. The modification you describe is an interesting approach to the situation. Can it be generalized? Could it politicized? Second Interview [] 4S J.N. To politicize it, you would need to create an awareness on the part of \u201cpoliticians.\u201d Can they understand and accept that every transformative act, every modification, is a cultural act as essential as creating something from scratch? Can they accept the fact that architecture is expressed and must increasingly be appreciated from within, a privileged space of enrichment, of nuance?... History provides us with beautiful examples of architectural forms that culminated in sedimentation, complementarity. The most convincing demonstration, a brilliant proof of the theory, may be the work of Carlo Scarpa. The first political question becomes: \u201cWhat do I destroy? What do I preserve?\u201d As a foil we have the memory of two grotesque periods of utter dreariness: the \"destroy everything'\u2019 period of the sixties and seventies, bulldozer renovation, followed by the \u201cembalming\u201d period\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s keep everything,\u201d let\u2019s create a pastiche, let\u2019s try to economize the architectural act. Architectural Reason J.B. Today things are designed for change; we have mobile, flexible, open ended devices. We need to design an architecture based on computer logic, which is happening everywhere anyway. Then there\u2019s multiculturalism, the possibility of changing one\u2019s identity, of putting a number of computer avatars into play, which is supposedly an essential aspect of modernity, or trans modernity, I\u2019m not quite sure. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about this lately. There must be a difference between things that change and things that become. Yes, there\u2019s a fundamental difference between change and becoming. Things that \u201cbecome\u201d are rare, exposed to misunderstanding, and possibly disappearance. Becoming is not the same as importing change, initiating it, wanting it at any price, imposing an imperative of change on people\u2014which is the credo of fashion, for example\u2014from which they never escape. That\u2019s not necessarily how things become something. Can a city change before our eyes? Of course we can transform it, modify it, but does it \u201cbecome\u201d something, then? We can say that cities have \u201cbecome\u201d things over time. It\u2019s not a question of creating nostalgia, but cities, in the past, ended up acquiring a kind of singularity, while here, now, before our eyes, they change at top speed, in a state of confusion. We\u2019re watching their characteristics erode. Even modification may be a way of reintroducing things into the process of change, where they would have risked being either destroyed or purely and simply \u201cmuseified,\u201d which is another miserable fate. Can we counteract change with another kind of need? Maybe we can go further: What will the city become? J.N. Working on what a city will become implies having a heightened awareness of its identity and requires that we help direct change. Change is fatal, automatic, inevitable, and many of our leaders, including city mayors, demand change because it\u2019s a sign of vitality, a form of growth that can excuse a range of absurdities. What a city becomes is decided on the basis of what came before, not some hypothetical future designed by a longterm planning effort. What it will become provides opportunities for the expression of a contextual and conceptual architecture that is both anchored and enriching. Change for the sake of change provides all sorts of excuses for just about anything; in that sense, it\u2019s part of the lapse of architectural reason. It can come about through the automatic reproduction of market models, as well as from a conception of the future based on the cloning of preexisting buildings. J.B. The lapse of architectural reason would be clone architecture. J.N. The historical development of cities, their evolution, has always bothered architects. It\u2019s a strange paradox. Architects are constantly modifying the urban fabric, yet they resist its evolution. They generally reproduce the previous period. They want to continue to build the city that was, and every time the city changes, they say, \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a city, it\u2019s a suburb, it's shame Secoari Interview [] 47 ful...The evolution of the city in the twentieth century is supposed to have resulted in violent upheaval. Yet we\u2019ve witnessed an architectural caste that has clung to the twentieth century city, the reconstruction of the European city; they still want to build streets and squares as they did before____But they\u2019re streets and squares devoid of meaning. The City of Tomorrow J.B. Yes, but that\u2019s not cloning, if you look at what happens__ J.N. It\u2019s a form of reproduction, duplication. Architects always stick to earlier forms used in the past; they\u2019re terrified of seeing the city move in ways they\u2019ve worshiped, ways that they reproduced themselves. The evolution of the city\u2014I\u2019m being somewhat anticipatory\u2014will continue to cause them anguish because a process of complete deterritorialization is taking place. We are all urban. What characterizes a city today is a space shared by a certain number of people in a given period of time: the time it takes to get there, move around, meet other people. From the moment we\u2014many of us\u2014can access or share a territory, we belong to that territory, and that territory becomes urban. We belong to a city. We\u2019re going to end up urban even if we live in the country, on our little farm twenty kilometers from the nearest village. We will also be part of the \u201ccity.\u201d Time, not space, will determine our being a part of urban life in the future. J.B. Only in the vision you\u2019ve just given of the city to come, the city is no longer a form in the process of becoming; it\u2019s an extended network. That\u2019s fine, you can define it as you have, but that urban life is no longer the life of the city but its infinite possibility: a virtual urban life, like playing on the keyboard of the city as if it were a kind of screen. I saw it as the end of architecture... by pushing the concept to its limit and primarily by using the photograph as a point of departure. This is reflected in the idea that the great majority of images are no longer the 48 [] Secoid Interview expression of a subject, or the reality of an object, but almost exclusively the technical fulfillment of all its intrinsic possibilities. It\u2019s the photographic medium that does all the work. People think they\u2019re photographing a scene, but they\u2019re only technical operators of the device\u2019s infinite virtuality. The virtual is the device that wants nothing more than to function, that demands to function. And to exhaust all its possibilities. Doesn\u2019t the same thing happen in architecture, with its infinite potential, not only in terms of materials but in terms of models, all the forms that are available to architects (postmodern or modern)? From that moment on, everything is arranged according to... We can no longer even speak of truth, in the sense that there might be a finality to architecture, but we can\u2019t speak of radicality, either; we\u2019re in the realm of pure virtuality. Virtual Architecture, Real Architecture J.B. So is there still an architecture in the virtual sense? Would it still exist? Or should it exist? Can we continue to call it architecture? We can combine things, techniques, materials, configurations in space indefinitely, but will it produce architecture? I finally realized that the Guggenheim in Bilbao was typically the type of object made of complex compositions, a building established using elements whose modules are all exposed, all the combinations expressed. You could imagine a hundred museums of the same type, analogous, obviously none of which would resemble one another. J.N. You can rely on Frank Gehry to surprise you! J.B. He\u2019s wonderful\u2014it really is marvelous\u2014and I\u2019m not making a value judgment about the object itself, but the structure of production and fabrication that made the building possible. As I see it, this architecture no longer possesses the literality I was talking about, that is, the presence of a singular form that couldn\u2019t be translated into another form. The Guggenheim itself is infinitely translatable into many other kinds of objects, as part of a chain____You get the impression that there could be a possibility of architectural evolution in this way. But let\u2019s say, to go back to my photography example, that the camera itself generates a nearly uninterrupted stream of images. If we accept this, the device could reproduce everything, generate images endlessly. And within that visual stream we can hope that there are one or two exceptional images that don\u2019t obey this indefinite, exponential logic of technology. But isn\u2019t this similar to the risk architecture is exposed to? At bottom, since we were talking about readymades, I would say that the Guggenheim is a readymade. All the elements are there from the start. The only thing we need to do is transpose them, permute them, play with them in different ways, and we\u2019ve made architecture. Only the transposition itself is automatic, a bit like an automatic writing of the world or the city would be. We can imagine whole cities built on this principle__In some American cities, this is already true. And it\u2019s no longer just an engineering question. In the past we could say that engineers constructed, generation after generation, based on minimal standards. But in the Guggenheim example, something else is going on that starts with a creative model that is already virtual. We descend from virtuality to reality, in any event toward real existence\u2014with the difference that, unlike information technology or mathematical modeling, in architecture, we end up with an object. J.N. In the Bilbao Guggenheim, we\u2019re witnessing a new computer revolution in the service of architecture. That is, a new computer based approach that would give substance to the idea, would lock or fix the most fleeting things, regardless of their immediacy. What\u2019s great about Frank Gehry is that he will make a sketch, crumple the paper, start over, and connect the sketch on paper or the relief drawing to an enormous program. From that point, the computer takes over and will begin to weave it all together, constructing an image in space, materializing something that is instantaneous and unstable, opening a direct passage from desire to the built reality. With Frank Gehry, we\u2019re watching this shortcut as it takes place, which is quite rare. 50 [] Secoid Interview J.B. Even so, he has an extraordinary playing field to work with. J.N. That\u2019s an optimistic assumption. J.B. When you walk around the Guggenheim, you realize that the building is, as far as its lines are concerned, illogical. But when you see the interior spaces, they are almost completely conventional. In any case there is no relation between those spaces and the building\u2019s ideality. J.N. Some of them are conventional because they have to obey museographical conventions. We haven\u2019t found a better way to exhibit Kandinsky, Picasso, and Braque other than on bright walls in quiet spaces. But there are also singular spaces: the lobby, the large hall, which is 250 meters long. Finally, there\u2019s also an attempt to adapt dream to reality, as always, but a very beautiful adaptation___However, where I do see a danger\u2014 and I\u2019m talking about 90 percent of global production at this time, certainly for all the large buildings\u2014is in this way of making architecture by recycling existing computer based data and coupling that with an extremely curtailed design procedure for the building. We\u2019re currently experiencing a wave of architectural cloning. From the moment an office building is made on the basis of an existing typology, whose technology and price and the conditions for its realization are known, we can duplicate that building and have it constructed without having to pay for a new design. This has resulted in the introduction of well defined technical procedures that enable companies to enter the international market. In Asia, South America\u2014look at Sao Paulo, for example\u2014buildings are going up where there is no sense of architectural intent at all. It\u2019s a form of architectural sabotage, prostitution. You used film and the world of politics as examples, both of which are also undergoing wholesale sabotage. Well, here I see architectural sabotage. You get the impression that architects themselves are going to produce the types of buildings that totally counter anything that could result in quality or a sense of nobility for a city. This type of architecture is proliferating at an alarming rate. The most efficient economic models are moving in that direction____ Computer Modeling and Architecture J.N. Is there anything easier than reusing existing data, given the fact that the computer can modify that data so quickly? You change a parameter here, another there, and after a few hours, it\u2019s done. The system is ready for a new building. Consequently, buildings are not really thought out; they are based on immediate profitability and hasty decision making. This also involves the complete sacrifice of a dimension that many feel belongs to another time_____There is no further need for public spaces, no further need to compose; all we have to do is accumulate. I need to buy a building. This is the way I can have it for the lowest cost and as quickly as possible. The parameters are simple, there\u2019s no need for any equations. J.B. Within that architectural space, does the possibility still exist for the architect to make his mark? J.N. Most of the time there is no architect in the sense generally understood. There are engineers who are pretty efficient at working with the standards. And those standards are associated with certain humanist or behavioral attitudes. In Europe, for example, you can\u2019t sell an office building that doesn\u2019t have direct light. In the United States, for a variety of reasons, standards can differ considerably from those in Europe. For example, you\u2019re authorized to use artificial light. In other words, let\u2019s say you have a building that\u2019s fifty meters deep and your offices are in the center of the building; you\u2019ll see the first window twenty meters away, and you\u2019ll be in artificial light all the time. Those buildings, which are the cheapest to build, sell well in Asia and South America. But no consideration is given to human comfort. And it isn\u2019t the \"developed\u201d countries that have the most advanced humanist standards! Often it\u2019s in the poorest cities that you find spontaneous acts of creation. These can be considered magnificent architectural achievements, even when they 52 [] Secoad Interview use corrugated sheet metal or pieces of rag. Here we can identify a poetics that is really a form of creation, whereas in the other cases, were getting pretty far away from that. J.B. So what constitutes a particular space today, assuming architects still have any creative freedom? J.N. Fortunately, all the conditions aren't in place yet for eliminating architecture. Within the evolution of the city there will always be a marginal place left for a handful of aesthetes\u2014aesthetes in their own life and in their behavior\u2014within highly privileged environments. What I wonder most about is what those cities will become_____In the near future, they won\u2019t be anything like what we\u2019re familiar with today. If the South is going to develop and catch up to the level of the cities of the North, using the same methods, it\u2019s going to take generations, and I don\u2019t see where the money is going to come from. No, I think there we\u2019re going to witness a true mutation. Lightness and Heaviness J.N. I even think that the next architectural and urban mutation will affect our relationship to matter. Other forms of mediation will be involved, and the mutation will shift toward the immaterial. Everything that is immaterial, virtual, sonorous, and part of the world of communication is already mutating. For example, anything that doesn\u2019t involve the creation of complex infrastructures will have an advantage. Everything that avoids pushing energy through enormous conduits, high voltage lines, that sort of thing. Our thoughts for the future should be focused on autonomy, lightness. This will lead us to the promotion of emerging and environmentally friendly forms of energy such as solar or wind energy, satellite communications for the transmission of data, everything that fosters the local breakdown of waste rather than its centralization. It is this kind of thinking that can give rise to new strategies that will completely alter our current notion of urban development, an evolution that will Secand Interview [] SB result in the appearance of a \u201cnoncity\u201d city, an urban territory. This kind of development can take into account the need for stable development. I\u2019m describing a growing trend, and we\u2019re still a long way off from its realization, but it seems to me that this is one example of a realizable utopia. J.B. Unfortunately I feel that in the future, as you mentioned, the great majority of construction, of building needs, will be technocratic, modeled. We will also have a luxury architecture reserved for a handful of privileged individuals. We see this happening in a number of fields, society, art... and the trend is toward increasing discrimination\u2014contrary to what we believe\u2014a discrimination that runs counter to the objectives of democracy and modernity. I\u2019m not sure whether or not architecture can play a role in all this. Even so, it has wanted to play a role in these developments, an equalizing role, if not a humanist one. J.N. Yes, but then this would be a result. Unfortunately it\u2019s not through architecture that we\u2019re going to change the world! What Utopia? J.B. Yes, that\u2019s true, but I\u2019m an idealist, I still believe we can change the world through architecture____It\u2019s utopian for all intents and purposes, yes. Utopian architecture was ultimately a realized architecture. But in the future, doesn\u2019t the trend risk moving in the opposite direction? Isn\u2019t there some danger that architecture may become a tool of discrimination? J.N. Although architecture may be unable to influence politics to change the world, politics has a responsibility to make use of architecture to achieve its social, humanitarian, and economic objectives. The economic dimension of culture\u2014whether it\u2019s architectural or not\u2014is taken into account in the industrialized countries. Since I\u2019m an idealist as well, I dream about programs for quickly resolving the living conditions of those who are most disadvantaged. But not using traditional poured concrete solutions, which end up cloning monotonous seventies style towers and linear block buildings in Seoul and Sao Paulo. No, I\u2019m praying for genuine self awareness. Only the readymades can provide very, very low production and distribution costs through automated production that can generate millions of copies. In today\u2019s shantytowns, it\u2019s easier to have a car or a television than a sink____I dream of project requirements that incorporate the use of the least expensive materials, the lightest, most flexible, easiest to cut and assemble, drill or handle\u2014 corrugated tin, ribbed plastic, lightweight channel, cables, sheet metal, project requirements that include the hardware, small ready made machines produced by the millions, which can make the best possible use of our knowledge of energy self sufficiency.... I dream about habitat packages that can be parachuted in, along with a few tools, but don\u2019t predetermine the shape of the structures that can be built. I\u2019d like to replace the old concept of the seventies of an architecture designed for the greatest number with an individual architecture not based on some cookie cutter model_______I don\u2019t know of a single UNESCO program today that\u2019s pushing this in any radical way. Still, we\u2019re not heading for disaster; we\u2019re already in the midst of total disaster. J.B. This year, in Buenos Aires, I spoke about the future of architecture. Yes, I believe in its future even though, as you mention, it won\u2019t necessarily be architectural, for the simple reason that we haven\u2019t yet designed the building to end all buildings, we haven\u2019t yet created the city to end all cities, a thought to end all thoughts. So as long as this utopia remains unrealized, there\u2019s hope, we must go on. We have to recognize that everything that\u2019s happening now on the technological side is dizzying, the modification of the species, and so forth_____However, in twenty years we will have succeeded in making the transition from sexuality without procreation to procreation without sexuality. J.N. Let\u2019s change the mode of reproduction for architecture! Let\u2019s invent a sexual reproduction of architecture. Secoad Interview [] 55 J.B. Procreation without sexuality challenges the idea of sexuality without procreation\u2014which has been the essence of eroticism. As the laboratory grows in importance, the field of eroticism will, for the most part, start to implode_But sexuality isn\u2019t the only thing_With genetic engineering, they\u2019re in the process of studying genes for future modification. American clinics already exist where people can type in the characteristics of their future infant so that it doesn\u2019t turn out homosexual_ Obviously, most of it is a scam, but that doesn\u2019t matter because there is total belief in the fact that we\u2019ll be able to improve the species, that is, invent another species. If we look at the human species as it is, or architecture as a historical form, or the city as a symbolic form, what comes afterward? An exponential proliferation of things in combinatorial fashion? At that point, we\u2019ve entered an abstract mental space, but one that\u2019s realized. They\u2019re not just formulas. J.N. We can make an analogy. Imagine the cloning of genetically programmed buildings; it\u2019s easier with buildings than with people. It\u2019s a kind of new superfunctionalism, virtual functionalism, which is not the functionalism of the old organic and social functions, use value, et cetera. It\u2019s something different. We need to determine if the new data are going to remain significant, since we\u2019re currently witnessing the sacrifice of architecture. Perceptible data are becoming a thing of the past. We can be optimists and assume that we\u2019re going to become true virtuosos of this new programming and we\u2019ll be able to integrate a whole range of information and assumptions capable of producing an absolutely terrific space, articulated around the problematic of the environment that\u2019s been eating at us. It\u2019s a question of survival. We have to integrate modern ecology. J.B. The environment, ecology... I\u2019m prejudiced against them. I feel that ecology exists precisely through the disappearance of ''natural\u201d data. Everything that is part of nature or natural must be eliminated if we are to build a perfect artificial world, where natural species will exist in \u201cartificially protected\u201d reserves. 56 [] Second Interview Architecture as the Desire for Omnipotence J.B. You get the feeling that the desire for omnipotence that drives architecture\u2014look at large government projects, for example\u2014 no longer has anything to do with the image of itself it wants to project, a bit like what\u2019s going on in genetic engineering. A geneticist today thinks he\u2019s replacing the mother and the father: he\u2019s the one who creates the child! He\u2019s the deus ex machina that creates the child, a child who originates with him and is no longer embedded in a sequence of natural descent J.N. It\u2019s been a long time since architects thought they were gods! Their only fear is that someone is going to snatch that dream away. Architecture is simply the art of necessity. Three quarters of the time, aside from the necessity of use and custom, there is no architecture\u2014or it\u2019s sculpture, commemoration. J.B. There\u2019s a funny little museum\u2014I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with it\u2014that was built by Kenzo Tange in Nice. It\u2019s adorable. It\u2019s a delicious little building that sits on a body of water, not far from the airport. It was built about three or four years ago and has remained empty since then because there was never any funding to buy content for it. So the museum has remained empty, and it\u2019s marvelous, a jewel. Over the past five or six years, Kenzo Tange hasn\u2019t built anything himself. So this may be the last project he accepted__He had reached his zenith. J.N. Sometimes the name of a great architect is like a brand. So we continue to build under the Kenzo Tange brand. I\u2019m in a very good position to know this because I discovered a bad clone of one of my projects in Tokyo. The basic project involved the grid of the horizon used for the Tete Defense, the perspective background for the historical axis between the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, a project that was awarded second prize in the president\u2019s competition in 1982. Sprekelsen won first prize for the Grande Arche, which is now completed. My design was an attempt to go beyond traditional Albertian perspective, where the sky is an always unfinished canvas. During the classical period, unfinished canvases revealed a checkerboard network of fine lines behind the painting that served as a grid so that the original cartoon could be enlarged. In my case, I imprinted a disembodied network on the horizon, dividing the void in the Arc de Triomphe into barely visible squares. The building was a three dimensional orthogonal grid, like a gigantic Sol LeWitt sculpture. The sun set along the axis, directly to the west, to create what I call \u201cmathematical sunsets.\u201d From a distance, it was two dimensional, without depth; from up close it provided a sense of hyperperspective, a bit like an Escher drawing. So in Tokyo they built this three dimensional grid and included, following the same proportions as La Defense, a building at each end. But since the building wasn\u2019t carefully situated with respect to the setting sun, they built an artificial sun into the grid, a ball of shiny steel that, in the evening, was artificially illuminated with red, violet, orange light... When I saw the building one evening, from a distance, I thought I was hallucinating____But as fate would have it\u2014and you should enjoy this\u2014the fatal element is that on the other side of Tokyo Bay, just a few kilometers away and separated only by the water, I was building a large, airy tower. From my project in Tokyo, I could see my grid, my mathematical sunset, and an artificial sunset! J.B. And what about your projects for the Universal Exposition in Germany? We have a pretty good script about the work: the living work, the dead work, the spectral work. The spectral is self perpetuating, like life; death is scattered among all the virtual productive forms. Some thought went into that project. J.N. I explained that to Fr\u00a3d\u00a3ric Flamand, the choreographer, who is going to stage this living spectacle like an exposition_ The big question that remains is the freedom of artists working with partnerships that only provide financing if they like the message_____This is no longer traditional sponsorship____But that\u2019s the way exhibitions will be financed in the future. They 5fl [] Second Interview will sponsor set design.... We\u2019re inside the subject. We\u2019ll have to provide subtitles. Berlin and Europe J.B. Does Berlin have any special meaning for you, as part of contemporary Europe? J.N. Berlin\u2019s destiny is an intimate part of the century. It\u2019s a historic capital with a fabulous heritage\u2014much of it due to K. F. Schinkel\u2014that became capital of the Third Reich, was given the once over by Speer, was partly destroyed, but survived, a captive abandoned to its conquerors. The city was martyred, cut up in pieces, and it still bears the stigmata. Then the city was freed and betrothed to Europe___once again a queen. It\u2019s a great story, straight out of Dumas\u2014the Countess of Monte Cristo! J.B. And what about the center of the city? Is there any stated political or urban plan that\u2019s been expressly implemented? J.N. The urban policy referred to as \"critical reconstruction\u201d goes something like this: \"Let\u2019s pretend nothing ever happened_ Let\u2019s reconstruct traditional buildings, opaque walls and small windows. Let\u2019s triumphantly fill everything that\u2019s empty. Let\u2019s put the cupola back on the Reichstag.\u201d There had been some vague impulse to establish an urban strategy when the Wall came down. One of the major dailies organized an appeal for ideas directed to seven or eight international architects. I proposed to them that they transform the no man\u2019s land near the Wall into a long \"meeting line,\u201d which would serve as a place where all the city\u2019s cultural events, sports, leisure activities, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, would be concentrated, face to face. By reversing the previous situation, the dividing line would become a weld, fullness would succeed the void, joy follow sadness, freedom prohibition.... But most of all, the city\u2019s history would remain embedded in its streets and stones.... I feel that the desire to wipe away those years is antithetical to the development of Berlin\u2019s identity and specificity. The city has plenty Second Interview [] 5! of reasons to be proud of its uniqueness, to demonstrate that it was able to make the most of a tragic past. J.B. In Berlin there has been a temptation to historicize everything, to include even the most horrible things in the city\u2019s heritage. This reminds me of the time they thought one of Brazil\u2019s largest favelas was part of the world\u2019s patrimony. J.N. Yes, before the fall of the Wall... But at the scale of the neighborhood, Berlin has shown a great deal of good sense in the way it has dealt with vegetation and water. The Germans are more fastidious than we are in working out microstrategies for innovation and management of the city on the day to day level. J.B. Which is very different from Frankfort and the other cities. Moreover, in 1968, when the same movements were under way in both Germany and France, there were more communities in Germany, but there were also larger apartments with common kitchens, and living was easier. In France we never succeeded; the big apartments were too expensive. By the way, it seems that the windows in the Galeries Lafayette... Architecture as the Art of Constraint \" J.N. Now, if the buildings are well known, as soon as something happens, everyone knows about it. Still, you should be aware of the fact that the glass is designed to fall without injuring anyone. Like a car windshield. But I get the feeling that, in our age of hypersecurity, we\u2019re going to need more than safety glass! In fact, we\u2019ve turned security into a key factor. Architecture is the art of constraint; we have to deal with that. I often use the example of film because we function much as movie directors\u2014directors and architects are the ones who work with the most constraints in this cultural universe. We have roughly the same relationship to a client, or a producer, or a promoter. They give us a certain amount of money to work with, and they like to see it multiply, without having any disasters on their hands. We have crews that SO [] Second Interview need to be directed within a given amount of time, and there\u2019s censorship. It\u2019s a very special situation, and ultimately quite different from anything a writer encounters. J.B. If it\u2019s a question of security, then yes, it is. J.N. The writer, the man of letters, the philosopher\u2014they don\u2019t need to ask anyone\u2019s permission. J.B. You seem to think that writing takes place without constraints. It\u2019s true that I have fewer than you, but as a writer, thinker, or researcher, I\u2019m dependent on a system, for example, an editorial system, that is becoming increasingly incomprehensible. J.N. The essential thing is that you, you can write a book that may be forgotten for thirty years if no one wants to publish your work, but it still exists, whereas a building in a drawing doesn\u2019t exist___A manuscript, even when it\u2019s locked in a drawer, exists. A filmmaker who only writes treatments or an architect who only constructs drawings accomplishes nothing. J.B. In that sense, the book is a prehistoric product! It\u2019s true that the book is not delivered to the reader or listener in real time, it only exists somewhere. But within a real time hegemonic culture, the book exists for no more than a few weeks. That\u2019s the price we pay: it simply disappears. J.N. There are miracles: Emily Dickinson was rediscovered many years later. J.B. The science of security has total control. It\u2019s everywhere; it exercises control in the form of censorship. Health is also involved, all those so called positive functions like protection, the environment. They can backfire dangerously by using censorship to fight singularity. Second Interview [] il Transparency J.B. Take the idea of transparency, for example. It\u2019s something extraordinary that expresses the play of light, with something that appears and disappears, but at the same time, you get the impression that it also involves a subtle form of censorship. This search for \u201ctransparency\u201d with which our era is fascinated is at the very least ambivalent in its relation to power. J.N. Obviously that\u2019s not exactly my ideological view of transparency! It\u2019s true that transparency can be awful if it is used incorrectly. What interests me in the evolution of architecture right now is the relation between matter and light, which can become something highly strategic. I\u2019m much more interested in the relation between matter and light exposed by the transparency or opacity of glass, for example, than by formal spatial parameters. Throughout the century, we have explored a variety of techniques, and now we know just about where we are, and there\u2019s no apparent reason to choose one form rather than another. But the problem of \"essence\u201d (of a form, an architecture, a given space) is a much more contemporary problem, associated with the evolution of our knowledge about matter and quantum physics, the discovery of fractals, et cetera. These are the consequences of the advance science and technology have on our awareness of how we apprehend the world, space, time, which are also going to change our perceptual relation to space. The trend today is to consider that constructing a piece of architecture means becoming part of a continuum, it means building in space. Light as Matter J.N. You have to think of light as matter\u2014and God knows, even for quantum physics, that\u2019s the crux of the problem. Physicists are currently trying to determine if a photon has mass, and they\u2019ll continue until they find its mass. For now, that mass is beyond what researchers are capable of determining, but they\u2019re pretty sure it exists. So what does \u201ctransparency\u201d mean? If we use certain materials, we\u2019ll be able to program a building differentially over time and play with ephemeral effects. You could say that traditional or classic architecture has always played with the permanence of architectural effects. More and more, were trying to work with concepts involving the programming of complex architectural effects for the same building. And working with transparency involves nothing more than working with matter to give a building different appearances. If I am working with glass, I can program what I\u2019m going to see. It can depend on whether I light it from the front or the back; I can play with depth of field, with transparency in the strict sense of the term. I can work with backlighting and a number of other things. There\u2019s a way of treating transparency by interpreting it strictly: \u201cI\u2019m going to do something that won\u2019t be seen, and I\u2019m going to see everything through it.\u201d On the architectural level, it\u2019s nothing but pornography.... J.B. The opposite of a secret, obscenity. J.N. My buildings try to play with the effects of virtuality, appearance. Viewers wonder if the material is present or not. We create virtual images, we create ambiguity. A building can play with transparency effects, but it does so through another element, which is reflection. At the Cartier Foundation building, the viewer never knows if they\u2019re seeing the sky or its reflection. Generally, you see both, and that ambiguity creates an interplay of multiple appearances. At the same time, the building makes use of the most trivial function of transparency for the exhibition space. There, you know that what is exposed in the interior is going to change the nature of the building, or at least one\u2019s perception of it\u2014but it\u2019s designed for that. Walking in front of the building, you see a display. J.B. That\u2019s what was so extraordinary about the opening of the Issey Miyake exhibit, because you had the designer\u2019s mobile elements inside, then you had a figurative representation formed by the guests themselves\u2014most of the women were dressed in Second Interview [] 6b Issey Miyake\u2014which created a second element in the overall design. But you also made the entire building transparent, which served as the general set design. Standing outside the building, you saw the action unfold in the space where the items were displayed and which had itself become an object in the exhibition. J.N. It would be very interesting to have a picture of the building that reveals all the exhibits that have taken place inside. One image I get a great deal of satisfaction from, in terms of under standing the Cartier Foundation space, is the By Night exhibition that took place there. The entire ground floor, plunged in darkness, remained completely dark for three months. That was part of the project. Transparency is also trans appearance.... We shouldn\u2019t consider this an ideology based on our ability to reveal everything, control everything. J.B. But that sense is still included in the idea of transparency, whether you want it to be or not.... And it implies a good deal more than just architecture. It implies all the means of information, a totality of information about oneself.... The idea of setting the attractions, the secrets of transparency against the dictatorship of transparency, of contrasting the interplay of the visible and the invisible against absolute visibility, is quite subtle. There are constructions that yield to the most trivial transparency, as a vector of power, focusing on the elimination of secrets. It only serves to reveal that it is no longer part of what we see. Disappearance J.N. What interests me about transparency is the idea of evaporation. Ever since man became man, he has fought against fate, against the elements, against matter. He started off building stone by stone, then made windows with small pieces of oiled paper, then learned how to do other things. There is a kind of architectural \u201cDarwinism\u201d at work, which is an evolutionary process through which man attempts to cover the maximum amount of space, the largest surface, insulate the most but with the least amount of material, without looking like he did 64 [] Seund Interview anything. There's been a tremendous push forward that still isn't over and never will be. We can summarize it as follows: how can we resolve the most material problems with the greatest amount of elegance? It involves the domination of matter. For example, the progress made in glass technology during the century has been astonishing. Among other advantages, it\u2019s made from sand, and it doesn\u2019t require colossal amounts of energy. Glass has good durability, and now we are able to do more or less what we want with it. We can do a great job insulating glass because it contains particles that can\u2019t be seen with the naked eye. Glass can be opaque or transparent; it can change color. Glass is also a kind of language, a kind of mutant material, a material subject to a wide range of subtle treatments. Glass is a significant trend. J.B. Isn't there a danger of seeing a proliferation of glass the way there was for plastic? A danger that it will become a universal material? J.N. Yes, because it\u2019s very flexible in the way it can be used; you can do whatever you want with it. Because of this architectural Darwinism, glass has acquired a number of qualities; it lends itself well to the interplay of materials because it\u2019s the only material that allows you to visually program a building by giving it different looks. One of the trends in architecture today is to capture everything that can affect this awareness of the moment We\u2019re also trying to capture variations of time, the seasons, the movements of visitors, and all of that is part of the architectural composition. There's also the idea of fragility, which is conveyed by the glass or by transparency\u2014in the sense of a more living, more poignant reality. Even though, ever since banks started using glass for protection, transparency has taken quite a hit. J.B. At least we still have the idea. In fact, like many others, the word \u201ctransparency\u201d has undergone considerable semantic evolution. Previously it stood for a kind of absolute ideal. We could believe in the transparency of our social relationships or our relation to power. Now it's turning into a form of terror. Secant Interview [] 65 J.N. Yes, now it\u2019s become a pretext, and this didn\u2019t just begin today. Stained glass windows were also used to similar effect. The Sainte Chapelle was there long before we were! But if we consider that architecture involves creating a poetics of sorts, an instantaneous metaphysics, then transparency assumes a different meaning. You have the idea of the solid and the ephemeral. The concept of perennity still remains the characteristic of architecture that is most often acknowledged. Consider a pyramid_____ J.B. We want architecture to be something that survives us. However, that\u2019s no longer a factor for modern architecture\u2014at least this is the way it seems to me. Or it\u2019s a factor that\u2019s been disguised, diverted; it\u2019s been turned into something like \u201csaving time.\u201d Overtaking the moment. J.N. Yes, but why is a building preserved? A building is preserved as soon as it\u2019s loved. J.B. Humans, too! What Does Architecture Bear Witness To? J.N. When a building serves as a witness to a bygone era, it is preserved. If a building is considered a suitable prospect for bearing witness, even if it\u2019s very fragile, like Katsura or, an example closer to home, the Eiffel Tower or Beaubourg, it is preserved. The fact that we maintain it, spruce it up, repair it, preserve it in perfect condition, is part of a ritual of conservation. Once a building has reached this dimension of \u201cbearing witness,\u201d it is, at least in a sense, archived, put under seal. Just because it\u2019s made of reinforced concrete or granite doesn\u2019t mean it will resist the depredations of time\u2014the buildings constructed around the time of the Second World War are already in pretty bad shape, whatever Paul Virilio may think. In Berlin, for example, Bauhaus buildings have been preserved, while those from the fifties are being leveled left and right. 66 [] Second Interview J.B. Le Corbusier\u2019s Villa Savoy has never been as lovely. It\u2019s been perfectly maintained and is more beautiful now than it was originally, more mature. I\u2019d go as far as to say that our architectural heritage has been enriched. Look at the Oriental influence in Frank Lloyd Wright, wood and brick. Consider the destiny that would have had______At the time, the avant garde in architecture was involved with organic forms, made with ephemeral materials that weren\u2019t destined to last, like Las Vegas. For me, since I\u2019ve known the city for thirty years, it\u2019s been a real massacre. J.N. Sometimes the Americans are so outrageous that the result is really outstanding. We\u2019ll continue to complain about this outrageousness until the day we wake up in shock____In any case, ar chitecture is, paradoxically, unviewable; only a very small part of what\u2019s built counts___Even Frank Lloyd Wright, who had con siderable influence on the century, who built hundreds of houses, including Falling Water, a handful of large buildings such as the Johnson Wax building and the Guggenheim... Even with him, it\u2019s not so easy to uncover his tracks in the United States. Singularity J.N. Speaking of which, I very much liked what you said about our expectations of architects: that they are the ones still creating \u201csingular objects.\u201d J.B. I don\u2019t deserve the credit... The object, in an unfortunate sense, is to an extent the end of architecture as something capable of translating a form belonging to the human community. Now, you mention \u201csingular objects,\u201d which reflects a different quality of the object. J.N. For more than twenty years, I\u2019ve been defending the notion of the object\u2019s \u201chyperspecificity,\u201d contrary to all the typological, ideological, and dogmatic information that it comprises. J.B. At some point, architecture is like poetry: you can provide all the interpretations of the poem you like, but it\u2019s always there. The object is literal in the sense that it is fully exhausted in itself. Second Interview [] 67 You no longer wonder about architecture or poetry; you have an object that literally absorbs you, that is perfectly resolved in itself. That\u2019s my way of expressing singularity.... And it\u2019s essential that at a given point in time this singularity become an event; in other words, the object should be something that can\u2019t simply be interpreted, sociologically, politically, spatially, even aesthetically. The object may be quite beautiful and not be a singular object. It will be part of the general aesthetic, of global civilization. Yes, I think some can still be found____But we also have to take into account the way the individual\u2019s singular perception divides the world There are no standards, there are no formulas, there\u2019s no aesthetic or even functional matrix you can apply. The same object can satisfy all the functions we assign to it. That doesn\u2019t prevent it from possessing this extra quality. J.N. Could we go so far as to say that the greater its singularity, the greater the chance it will be appreciated? That would be a consequence more than anything else. J.B. Anything can be appreciated; I\u2019m very skeptical about the notion_____It\u2019s not a question of relations, affects. You can have an affect for any object whatsoever that singularizes it for you. But at some point, what\u2019s needed is a different kind of awareness. If you like it, it becomes your dog and not someone else\u2019s. But this is something different, which is harder to articulate, because it can\u2019t be grasped intellectually.... It even seems to me that there\u2019s something a bit demoniacal in it, in the German sense of the word. J.N. In the case of singularity, the aesthetics of the object is not fundamental to the extent that aesthetics obeys a type of convention, a type of judgment. You may feel an object is ugly, very ugly, uglier than ugly, monstrously ugly, and yet it can become in itself an entity that is absolutely essential. By that very fact, the object will become beautiful. Fortunately, it\u2019s not necessary to respect aesthetic codes to define singularity. The interesting thing is the ability to differentiate yourself from them and transgress them. 68 [] Second Interview J.B. Take the Louvre Pyramid. At one point there was a movement to prevent its construction, because it was ugly. Then everyone calmed down. J.N. It became widely accepted through use. But to me, it\u2019s not an example of a singular object. J.B. It\u2019s obviously an academic object. But audacity, or the lack of audacity, is something that belongs not solely to an isolated object but also to the space it generates. At La Defense, in spite of everything, we can say that a strange space has been generated. Moreover, at first we don\u2019t know whether an object will become singular or not. This is what I referred to previously in terms of \u201cbecoming,\u201d of becoming\u2014or not becoming\u2014singular. It\u2019s a question not of change but of becoming. And this is something we can\u2019t determine. Sometimes even circumstances, whether they\u2019re historical, sociological, or whatever, trigger an object\u2019s singular becoming. J.N. Pure event, \u201cI perceive architecture as pure event,\u201d you said. J.B. I\u2019m interested in the things that shock me. I was writing about architecture as pure event, beyond beauty and ugliness. J.N. But you contrast the \u201csingular\u201d with the \u201cneutral\u201d and the \u201cglobal.\u201d J.B. Yes, I differentiate global, universal, and singular. J.N. And with respect to the neutral, you were kind enough to add: \u201cWe don\u2019t need architects for that!\u201d Neutrality, Universality, and Globalization J.B. I would say the same for literature, thought, art, et cetera. Neutrality is assured; there\u2019s no problem with that. It\u2019s the total security we\u2019re offered day after day. Neutrality has never had a good reputation because neutral things are indifferent. At the Secoad latetview [] 69 very least, it signifies an absence of quality, the nonqualitative. It\u2019s not the land of thing you can like; we perceive the mass, conformity. But now we\u2019re seeing the emergence of another form of neutrality, which appears in the literal sense of the term this time. In fact, all it can do is appear, since it is defined within a domain where all possibilities neutralize one another. This domain is different than before, when there was neither quality nor relief. Here it\u2019s the opposite. You have a \u201cdynamic\u201d neutrality that is open to so many possibilities that they are all neutralized, like the history of the still camera I mentioned earlier, a device that allows you to take all possible photographs. From that point on, you are neutralized as a subject. This neutrality, for me, is the baseline of the human species\u2014and we can reach the same point in architecture, as well. It\u2019s a cultural effect, a choice, our choice. It\u2019s true, I contrast the singular with the neutral, but I also contrast it with the global. We need to be clear about our terms. There is a considerable difference between the universal and globalization. The universal remains a system of values, and in principle, everyone can access it. It\u2019s still the object of certain conquests. But little by little, it\u2019s becoming neutralized; cultures are being juxtaposed. Nonetheless the result is still a top down equalization, through value, whereas in the process of globalization, we\u2019re witnessing a bottom up leveling, according to the lowest common denominator. This is the \"Disneyfication\u201d of the world. Unlike the values that drive universalization, globalization will be a theater of intense discrimination, the site of the worst discrimination. It will be a \u201cpyramidal\u201d globalization, so to speak. The society it generates will always be dissociated and no longer a society of conflict. One has the impression that between the two, that is, between those who will have access to information technology, the future \u201cwired\u201d world, and the others, the connection will have been broken. The two halves of society will become disconnected. They will each go down their own path, in parallel, and one will tend increasingly toward sophistication with respect to knowledge, speed, while the other will live with its exclusion\u2014but without conflict, without any gateways. It\u2019s more dangerous than a revolt because it neutralizes conflict itself. Forget about class struggle! There won\u2019t even be any \u201cclashes.\u201d Forget revolution. There won\u2019t be any relations of force; the fuse has melted. That\u2019s globalization. In the English language press, the term refers primarily to economic markets. I mean something much more comprehensive. But it\u2019s the same underlying process if you look at it conceptually. It\u2019s an identification, a totalization\u2014of the field of neutrality\u2014it stands in contrast to the universal, which was an idea, a value, a utopia. This is the dimension of \u201crealized\u201d objects. In the case of the universal, it\u2019s the particular that stands opposite; in the case of globalization, it\u2019s singularity, a radicality of a different order. And one that doesn\u2019t enter into direct conflict with antagonistic forces. This isn\u2019t a revolutionary force; it exists elsewhere, is developed elsewhere, disappears. It\u2019s interesting to observe what remains of the irreducible in this process of globalization, this irreversible movement. This movement is a system, contrary to what the term would seem to imply, for the term \u201cglobalization\u201d appears to imply that everything is comprised within it. But that\u2019s not the case. This movement is going to create a virtual hypersociety that will have access to all the resources\u2014this much is clear\u2014and all the power. Members of this hypersociety will be an absolute minority, an increasing minority, and in the majority of cases\u2014in generic terms\u2014the rest will remain excluded. So we\u2019ll be moving toward these parallel, dualistic societies, where things no longer function the same way on either side of the divide. What will that mean for life on earth? I don\u2019t know, but I have the impression that it\u2019s happening now in cities. In this sense, the cities are prophetic. They are moving toward a kind of virtuality in terms of real, natural, traditional space. On the plane of the real, of reality, space is shared, while the most abstract virtual space is never shared. It\u2019s the privilege of those who have access to it. We won\u2019t be dealing with a dominant class any longer, but a computer rich intelligentsia that will give free rein to complete speculation. Yet ultimately that\u2019s how Europe is being created. The euro, which is so much in the news Seand htenriew [] 71 today, is the epitome of the virtual object, imposed from above. All imposed decrees are established without any relation to actual opinion, but who cares, it will happen, and it did happen! Everyone will operate within a parallel market, a kind of black market, with its markups; everyone will organize their escape as well. Increasingly we\u2019ll see parallel sites spring up: parallel markets, parallel work, moonlighting, peripheral capitals, and so on. And in a sense, that\u2019s fortunate, because if control of one over the other were total, it would be an unbeatable defense strategy. You almost get the impression that things were predestined to be this way. Destiny and Becoming J.B. For me, destiny is something that cannot be exchanged. This is true up to and including construction: what can\u2019t be exchanged for its own end is subject to destiny, to a form of becoming and singularity, a form of destiny. Predestination is a little different, for it claims that the end is already present in the beginning, but doesn\u2019t eliminate the end. In one sense, the end is already there; a cycle of predestination is then established. Destiny is what can\u2019t be inscribed within a finalizing continuity, something that can\u2019t be exchanged, whether for better or worse. I feel that thought, theory, is inexchangeable. It can\u2019t be exchanged either for truth or for reality. Exchange is impossible. It\u2019s because of this that theory even exists. However, there are many cases where exchange is possible.... Maybe this reflects the history of the city, architecture, space\u2014there has to be a possibility of exchange so that things can be exchanged with one another. But sometimes they don\u2019t get exchanged at all. There may be no equivalent to a given building, there\u2019s no need, it can\u2019t be exchanged against anything else. They\u2019ll build another one, but as it stands, it can\u2019t be exchanged for something else. It\u2019s an unhappy fate, a failure in a certain sense. However, singular things can\u2019t be exchanged, either; they\u2019re autonomous. Only in this case, we can say that we\u2019re dealing with a fully realized form. 72 [] Second Interview J.N. There\u2019s something that amused me in all this talk about destiny and fatality: when you finally advise the architect to not think! J.B. Ah, yes! When I said that we have too many ideas. I say the same thing about philosophers, as well.... You have to differentiate thought from ideas. I don\u2019t recommend that they not think; I advise them against having too many ideas. J.N. We know that this is difficult territory. We know our fate isn\u2019t clear to us, and yet we still need a minimum amount of strategy to deal with it And that\u2019s what\u2019s actually going on. What kind of architecture can survive, what kind will still have meaning in tomorrow\u2019s world, in a context that we are in large part familiar with. J.B. That we know almost too well. That\u2019s the problem. The Idea of Architecture and History J.B. One of the problems with today\u2019s architecture is that we can no longer make architecture without having an idea of architecture in mind, the history of architecture. In philosophy, for example, you have to take history into account, the references to which ideas are subjected by history, any number of heteroclite issues. That\u2019s where I say, \u201cLet\u2019s not think too much!\u201d Whenever you have an architectural project in mind, different data about space, history, the environment, the elements of the project, objectives, finalities, all of that provides you with the information to produce a disconcerting object that will be something quite different than the initial project. But if you project too much, if your conceptualization is too narrow, the lode runs out, and I think this is just as true in the field of theoretical research. People who accumulate every reference they can lay their hands on, multiplying the amount of data, carefully delineating the path they\u2019ll follow out toward infinity, exhaust themselves before they can say... what? Nothing. Sccoad Interview [] 73 J.N. Yes, we can make architecture that is not about architectural theory. Architecture is no longer an autonomous discipline. But that doesn\u2019t force us to think more, to broaden our field of investigation. The majority of the buildings in our cities weren\u2019t thought out in that sense. They arrived there through a kind of automatism, a lack of attention___So I think, if we want singular objects, then we\u2019ll have to use various kinds of analysis, reflection, connotation; we'll have to establish relationships among contradictory objects. In short, we\u2019U have to start thinking. Another Kind of Wisdom J.B. Look, I don\u2019t want to make a mystery of spontaneity. In fact, we should abdicate to serendipity. J.N. Serendipity? J.B. Serendipity, yes. In fact, no one knows the exact definition_ It\u2019s the idea of looking for something and finding something completely different. J.N. But I\u2019m a big fan of the sport! I\u2019ve been practicing serendipity all my life without knowing it. J.B. The important thing is to have looked. Even if you miss what you were initially looking for, the direction of the research itself shifts, and something else is discovered.... The concept is primarily applied to the sciences, but it\u2019s also the name of a store in London, where you can find all sorts of things, except whatever it is you\u2019re looking for. The word comes from the Sanskrit. It\u2019s a beautiful way of saying \u201cwisdom.\u201d It has been anchored in sacred Indian literature for centuries. J.N. At bottom we\u2019re looking for something, but we never know what. When we find it, everything is all right_Fortunately, in architecture there\u2019s never a single correct response. There are 74 [] Second latcrvlcw millions of pathetic and a few thousand exciting responses. All we need is to find one that can be realized. But these responses are rarely simplistic. Paradoxically they are trying to be obvious but indecipherable. There\u2019s nothing worse than a building whose recipes we know by heart. In architectural conferences, you often hear people discuss kitchen recipes that result in the creation of a building. People don\u2019t always want to tell you \u201chow,\u201d they don\u2019t want to reveal their strategy, but rather want to create an aura of mystery that\u2019s essential for a certain type of seduction. The Question of Style J.B. In Buenos Aires the presentation of buildings by different architects, all of them well known, lasted five days. There was never a question of the mystery you speak of, only the nature of the projects, the development of a program, the results obtained, the international career of the person exposing his or her work. With respect to this sense of mystery, what we saw was incredibly impoverished. J.K. We are dealing with thickness, something that will never be totally elucidated, deciphered. There will always have to be things that remain unsaid and things in which we lose ourselves. At the same time, an architectural work should be capable of being experienced by people with very different sensibilities. So we have to set up a certain number of markers that can capture the attention or the interest of this highly diverse group. J.B. In a number of fields, this kind of sociological calculation is barely functional. The entire field of advertising is focused on this type of approach, but in reality they have no idea what they\u2019re doing. J.N. It\u2019s true of literature, painting, music. The great works, the great books, are universal. They affect people from all cultures and all levels of education. Secsnd Interview [] 75 J.B. Yes, but to the extent that these artists are able to create without giving in to the farce of art, art history, or aesthetic codes. So it's possible, ultimately. It's as if the architect were able to build without first reviewing the field of architecture, its history, and everything that is constructed. The ability to create a vacuum is undoubtedly the prerequisite for any act of authentic creation. If you don\u2019t create a vacuum, you\u2019ll never achieve singularity. You may produce remarkable things, but the heritage you have to deal with is such that you\u2019ll have to pass through a whole genetics of accumulation. J.N. Yes, but that doesn\u2019t rule out a strategy to flush out... J.B. Architecture can\u2019t be as spontaneous as writing. J.N. Certainly. Still, what characterizes architecture is its writing, the fact that we are able to recognize any detail at all. This doesn\u2019t only involve an exterior shape. And if you look at all the great architects of this century\u2014Wright, Le Corbusier, Aalto, Kahn\u2014you can recognize them by the details. This singularity of their architecture is remarkable. There must be something natural and spontaneous in it, but at the same time, it\u2019s planned, worked on, premeditated. J.B. You could say predestined. J.N. This activity of premeditation is the thing architecture needs the most at this time. It will prevent its banality, mindless repetition, autism. J.B. Not just anyone has the means to make his mark on a building, but anyone can write a bad article. Facility, in this case, is dangerous. J.N. No, but many people are under the illusion that depth, thought, comes about through omnipresent decoration. Decoration is used to palliate this absence of intent, the incoherence 76 [] Second laterview of architecture. Generally the architecture is hidden behind an ersatz facade. It\u2019s the obsession that makes the difference; with decoration you can mimic anything, any universe. There are decorators who could be considered architects. They work at revealing the spirit of the place. This was true during the thirties, and it\u2019s still true today when people like Starck succeed in transforming a place. J.B. Do they still speak of style in architecture? Because compared to singularity, I would like to know what style is______We recognize someone who has style, but the work produced won\u2019t necessarily be the embodiment of a singular vision. J.N. Except if the style happens to be a singular vision___It\u2019s one of the big questions in architecture. Style addresses the problem of the evolution of architecture. We can say that architects, in the twentieth century, have positioned themselves as artists in the plastic arts. They\u2019ve appropriated the field; they\u2019ve pretended it was also their own. Once this formal identification was made, the number of caricatures began to multiply: the ones who made everything white or everything blue, all in garlands, and so on. That\u2019s how myths get started. For example, historically Meier\u2019s architecture always turns out white. You\u2019re familiar with Ungers, who only does squares; Baselitz, the artist, turns things upside down. Those are perfectly identifiable styles that conceive of architecture as a preexisting vocabulary that can be used according to a preexisting code. A style, in my sense of the term, is something different. Style is a way of doing. But I can also suggest another definition______Personally, I\u2019m very inter ested in the way a style works, which has presented a problem\u2014 concerning me\u2014for certain critics or certain individuals, who wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s this guy doing?\u201d When an architect\u2019s way of doing something is identified, the way we recognize his style is as well. If these artist architects build, their building will always be particular, since it will become their signature, in a way; but their approach has no relation to other particularities that they could exploit but don\u2019t. They are enclosed within a system. Style should reflect a singular way of thinking the world. Secrad Intenriew [] 77 Inadmissible Complicity J.N. You\u2019ve said that you prefer complicity to complexity. I like the idea very much. It reflects a real problem in architecture. We manage to make things that are profound only through complicity, and perhaps only through this complicity do we achieve a certain degree of complexity, which isn\u2019t an end in itself. Often things are complex when they have to be, quite simply. This preliminary search for complexity has long been associated with a theory that claims that interesting things have to be complex because we then escape from a completely repetitive form of simplicity. The idea of complicity in architecture is more unusual, more uncommon. Complicity is the only guarantee that we\u2019ll be able to push the boundaries. But we need to consider this in a very broad sense. If this complicity is established, it means that something more than simple comprehension is going on between people, a shared meaning, mutual assistance. Obviously, I can\u2019t build the Cartier Foundation building if I don\u2019t establish a relationship of complicity with the person who conceived and manages it. And this complicity has to exist among the crew, an enterprise, a global project. There has to be a shared dynamic, one that\u2019s often unspoken but translated into actions. However, the word \u201ccomplicity\u201d is not always well received. In this world, where everyone is trying to find their place, if you start weaving privileged links, you\u2019re accused of plotting, of cheating. If you set up relationships that are more than contractual, if you begin to enjoy doing something, you\u2019re called on the carpet.... You\u2019re not supposed to have fun while doing architecture! And you\u2019re especially not supposed to talk about desire before talking about the project requirements. However, all the great architects made their careers by exploiting this sense of complicity between contractor and client For example, look at Gaudi or Gehry: contractor and client were inseparable. Freedom as Self Realization J.B. Like seduction, \u201ccomplicity\u201d is a term with a bad reputation. Both are contrasted with an ideology of transparency. The complicity of a connection can\u2019t be \u201cexposed,\u201d but at best suggested. Personally, I\u2019m not sure how free we are to accept such complicity. Obviously I have a kind of prejudice against freedom. Against liberation, in any case. Freedom has become the ideal of modernity. And this no longer seems to pose any problems. When the individual is freed, he no longer knows what he is. Be yourself! Be free! That\u2019s part of the idea, the new diktat of modernity. Under the constraints of this new liberation, the individual is forced to find an identity for himself. Today we still live with the ultimatum that we find our identity, fulfill ourselves, realize our full potential. In this sense we are \u201cfree\u201d because we have the technical means for this realization. But this is a prodigal freedom and culminates in individualism. It hasn\u2019t always been like this. The freedom of a subject struggling with his freedom is something else. Today we have an individual who isn\u2019t struggling with anything but who has set himself the goal of realizing himself in every possible dimension. We can\u2019t really postulate the problem of freedom. It\u2019s no more than a kind of operationality. J.N. Is that what you mean when you write, \u201cUltimately, we exist in a society where the concept of architecture is no longer possible, the architect no longer has any freedom\u201d? J.B. No, not exactly. What would freedom mean within an ideological field that is no longer the same? Freedom in a state of subjection, want, is an idea and, at the same time, a kind of destiny: you desire it, you look for it. Liberation is not at all the same thing as freedom. That\u2019s what I wanted to make clear. When you\u2019re free, when you think you\u2019re living a realized freedom, it\u2019s a trap. You are standing before a mirage of the realization of various possibilities____Everything that was once idea, dream, utopia, is virtually realized. You are faced with the paradox of a freedom that has no finality. It\u2019s simply the consecration of your identity. J.N. What are you saying? J.B. Well, that you have the right to fulfill yourself in the name of this freedom. Simply put, at some point in time, you no longer Seraid Interview [] 79 know who you are. It's a surgical operation. The history of your identity helps set the trap. The sexes find their sexual identity, and nothing more is shared between them, they exist in their own bubble. Alterity? Freedom is charged with a heavy load of remorse. And the liberation of people, in the historical sense of the term, is also a fantastic deception. There is always an element of the unthinkable that won\u2019t have been evacuated. So there\u2019s a kind of remorse because of what\u2019s transpired. We\u2019re free\u2014so what? Everything begins at the point where, in reality, we have the impression that something was supposed to be fulfilled. Take the idea that the individual becomes free\u2014every man for himself, of course. At that point there is a terrible betrayal toward... something like the species, I don\u2019t know what else to say about it. Everyone dreams of individual emancipation, and yet there remains a kind of collective remorse about it. This surfaces in the form of self hatred, deadly experimentation, fratricidal warfare... a morbid state of affairs. There is even a final requirement that this state of affairs itself be questioned. Liberation is too good to be true. So you look for a destiny, an alterity, which is artificial, most of the time. You\u2019re forced to invent the alterity, to invent something risky, to rediscover at least a kind of ideal freedom, not a realized form, because that really is unbearable. The absence of destiny is itself a fatality! So what can the architect do with this freedom? J.N. The architect is not free himself.... And men are not free with respect to architecture. Architecture is always a response to a question that wasn\u2019t asked. Most of the time, we are asked to handle contingencies, and if while handling these needs, we can create a bit of architecture, so much the better.... But we also realize that three quarters of the planet is not actively thinking about architecture. And where it is too present, people resent it Where is the point of balance between these two extremes? J.B. It\u2019s not a handicap; it\u2019s a strategic value. J.N. Regardless of the future form our civilization takes, there will always be a place for architecture, there will always be a particular BO [] Secoii Interview strategy for inhabiting it, a territory to defend. Even if we start with the assumption that the city will disappear, in the sense that it will no longer be physically present as a territory\u2014which doesn\u2019t lend itself to an urban vision of architecture\u2014there will still always be architectural acts that assume some relation to the new data and which will be a source of pleasure. We\u2019ve been told that the book would disappear with the Internet, but we\u2019ll always need a home, some place to live__Even if the architec tural gesture tends to become increasingly automatic. J.B. For cloned encephalons! J.N. An automatic architecture created by interchangeable architects. This fatality doesn\u2019t bother us; it\u2019s an essential part of today\u2019s reality. We still have the exception to invalidate the rule. The philosopher and writer Jean Baudrillard has taught at several universities around the world. He is the author of numerous books and essays. In English his most notable works are Simulacra and Simulation, America, The Vital Illusion, Symbolic Exchange and Death, and Consumer Society. Jean Nouvel, an architect of international renown, has designed L\u2019Institut du Monde Arabe and the Cartier Foundation in Paris. With Paul Jodard, he is author of International Design Yearbook (1995) and Present and Futures: Architecture in Cities. He also worked with Conway Lloyd Morgan on Jean Nouvel: The Elements of Architecture. Robert Bononno is a recent recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts award for the translation of Isabelle Eberhardt, Seven Years in the Life of a Woman: Letters and Journals. His many translations include Cyberculture (Minnesota, 2001), Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, French New Wave, and Ghost Image. K.

        "Foreword K.",
        "Michael Hays The Singular Objects of Architecture should not create the expectation that either architecture or philosophy will be treated in this dialogue in anything like a traditional way (which, were it the case, would seem not so much old fashioned as reactionary, coming from two of the few cultural figures practicing today that we could still dare to call progressive).",
        "Indeed, it is better to state the reverse: what first strikes one as extraordinary about this conversation is that architecture and philosophy are treated with any distinction at all by progressive thinkers in our present era.",
        "In our own time, the de differentiation of disciplines and the tendentious erasure of boundaries between specific cultural materials and practices promise to homogenize all distinction, difference, and otherness into a globalized, neutralized sameness.",
        "Much of what claims to be progressive thought is happy to aestheticize this situation, to accelerate its effects, and to trade in any remaining individuality or singularity of thought for a randomized, spread out delirium.",
        "The flattening seems to have been chosen.",
        "Besides, any disciplinary autonomy or expertise that might counter this leveling tendency is destined to be crushed anyway under the massive movement of the world system itself, to be emulsified along with everything else into vil vffi [] Foreword so many cultural and economic fluids.",
        "What is extraordinary about this conversation, then, is its declaration, against all that, to search for singular objects (rather than globalized fluids) as might be found in architecture and philosophy.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re not heading for disaster, we\u2019re already in the midst of total disaster,\u201d Nouvel declares at one point.",
        "Yet neither he nor Baudrillard ever laments the loss of a real or idealized past, nor do they accept, not even for a moment, the cynically complacent preemption of the future.",
        "The second surprise of The Singular Objects of Architecture is that what is offered, both as program and as practice exemplified in this particular dialogue, is a renewal of utopian thought, a revived attempt at envisioning a possible future out of our disastrous present, a way of thinking that has been under ban now for more than two decades.",
        "Against the hegemony of the antiutopian, real time thinking of our contemporary technocratic positivism and experiential nominalism (\u201cWhat\u2019s mine is mine, and you can\u2019t feel it\u201d), the singular object must be anticipatory, inexhaustible, and shared; it must destroy culture (or what has become of it) and redistribute the leftovers.",
        "And so, while architecture and philosophy are treated together as parts of a period problem\u2014as disciplines and practices with specific histories, transitions, and transformations, subjected to the desultory effects of history now, in our own period\u2014they will not remain unchallenged or unchanged in this dialogue.",
        "If the singular object is to be both utopian and destructive, future directed and exquisitely representative of the present, it will be a peculiar object indeed.",
        "Its model will be neither architecture nor philosophy freestanding, as traditionally practiced, but a productive enfolding of one into the other\u2014an event more than an object, a constructional operation in which each discourse interprets the other but nevertheless produces a new, irreducible, singular thing: that peculiar thing we call theory.",
        "\u201cI feel that thought, theory, is inexchangeable,\u201d says Baudrillard.",
        "\u201cIt can\u2019t be exchanged for truth or for reality.",
        "Exchange is impossible.",
        "It\u2019s because of this that theory even exists.\u201d Theory is the diagram of the singular object of architecture.",
        "This, at least, should come as no surprise, for work of such large ambition as Foreword [] ix is evidenced here is to be found today almost nowhere other than theory.",
        "Theory is ready to travel.",
        "Although at its best, theory will stay close to the historicity of its material, mediating between specific cultural practices and specific historical contexts, theoretical constructions also possess an uncanny capacity to cross over, drift, and expand across disciplines, however much authors, institutions, and orthodoxies try to confine them.",
        "Theory is autonomous (\u201cinexchangeable\u201d), but it is nourished by circulation\u2014by borrowing and trading, by unconscious influence or wholesale appropriation.",
        "Through the accidents of discourse, a body of theory can also be dislodged and pressed into the service of a quite different one, reinvested with unpredicted content, and refimetioned for unexpected vocations.",
        "Not least among such transactions is that between architecture and philosophy, provided we understand that coupling in an expanded sense to include urbanism, semiology, Ideologiekritik, and certain strains of poststructuralist thought; for it is that fusion (what we now call, simply, architecture theory) that, since the mid 1960s, has so energized architectural discourse in academic and professional circles, turning us away from an earlier functionalist, empiricist, foundationalist way of thinking and toward new registers of signification.",
        "By the 1980s, architecture theory had discovered affinities with other branches of theory and developed concerns with textual strategies, constructions of subjectivity and gender, power and property, geopolitics, and other themes that were already part of the general poststructuralist repertoire but whose spatial dimension was now foregrounded.",
        "This entailed that the emphasis on the production of architectural objects (which aimed to prescribe normative standards for design and layout methods and motives for implementation) should give way to an emphasis on the production of architecture as a subject of knowledge.",
        "Theory took on the task of revealing the unintended ideological presumptions that architectural procedures and techniques alternately enabled or tried to remove from the possibility of thinking, which is to say x [] Foreword that theory understood architecture as one of culture\u2019s primary representational systems.",
        "The concern with the specific internal workings of architecture\u2014which tend to be mainly synchronic, synthetic, and projective\u2014was not abandoned so much as folded into various discourses of context and exteriority, recalibrated according to what was sayable or thinkable in the idiolects of Marxism, de construction, psychoanalysis, and other imported systems.",
        "But these systems were not merely yoked together with architecture.",
        "Rather, something of a shift of level, as much as perspective, took place, in which architecture\u2019s specific forms, operations, and practices could now more clearly be seen as producing concepts whose ultimate horizon of effect lay outside architecture \u201cproper,\u201d in a more general sociocultural field.",
        "This new activity of theory demanded not new ideas for buildings but the invention of altogether new techniques for rethinking issues of representation, foundation, subjectivity, structure and ornament, materiality, media, and more.",
        "What used to be called philosophy, then, began to think its problems through architecture rather than the other way around.",
        "And this inevitably attracted some of the most important thinkers of our time (including Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Fredric Jameson) to ponder architectural problems.",
        "There has rarely been a sustained conversation between a philosopher and an architect of the scope and focus that we have here.",
        "Then again, a certain horizontality of thought, along with the desire to interpret the totality, seems demanded by our current situation.",
        "For all the apparently wild multiplicity of our present system of objects, there is also the constant magnetic pull of the single global market and a corporate controlled re totalization of all the dispersed vocations and functions of social life into a single space time of consumption and communication.",
        "Our different day to day activities are no longer tied to determinate needs or to specific exchanges between people and objects, but rather to a total universe of signs and simulacra floating in economic and cultural informational fluids.",
        "Even the conscious ideologies of rebellion and negative critique seem to be not so much co opted by the system as a strategic part of the system\u2019s internal workings.",
        "At certain moments, in certain singular objects, architecture itself produces the perception of this conflictedly overdetermined situation; architecture becomes a kind of precipitate of the vapor that we used to call the social.",
        "The twinness of the World Trade Center, for example\u2014a building that was a replica of itself\u2014was already, in the 1960s when the towers were built, an anticipatory sign of the computerized, genetically networked, cloning society that was emerging.",
        "In the next decade, the Centre Pompidou, even more deeply conflicted, signals the catastrophic finishing off of mass culture by the masses themselves: a new breed of cultural consumer who is also, along with the paintings and the cash, both the raw material and the product of the new museum.",
        "And then the architecture of our own time (the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, perhaps, one of infinite possible clones or chimeras spun out of a software package) seems to become altogether virtual, for an audience that is everyone and everywhere\u2014not so much an architectural readymade (in the sense of Duchamp) as an architecture already made, a transparent cutout that is its own template.",
        "In their conversation, Baudrillard and Nouvel turn over and over again possible ways of understanding this situation and its agents, mapping it through the languages of architecture, philosophy, and both together (and it is fascinating to register the slippages of perspective between the architect and the philosopher, to compare how the mind feels performing work on the problem one way and then the other, but also to become aware of the preference that both have for a description of the totality over the separate, abstract parts).",
        "But the provocations, responses, and probes are not meant to prtciser the ways in which architecture simply replicates the base and superstructure apparatus of which it is a primary organ (the code words for such ideological reproduction include \u201cscreen architecture\u201d and \u201cclone architecture,\u201d but also the neutral and the global).",
        "Baudrillard and Nouvel search also for some autonomous force or effect produced by the object not in culture but xii [] Foreword alongside it, in the penumbra of culture, a force that thickens the situation, obscures the scene, and gums up the hegemonic workings of visibility and transparency.",
        "This attribute of the object is alternately called its \u201csecret,\u201d its \u201cradicality,\u201d its \u201cliterality,\u201d or indeed its singularity.",
        "But dearly this is an apprehension of the singular object quite the reverse of any that would fixate on aesthetic properties to the exdusion of larger, \u201cextrinsic\u201d factors.",
        "Rather, the singular object is the way of access, through the coils of contradiction, to be sure, but nevertheless opening onto the determining conditions of its own cultural surround.",
        "Take Nouvel\u2019s own work, which has famously found its identity in a logic of the surface.",
        "On the one hand, from the earliest stone facades to the steel and glass curtain wall, architecture has always played a game of contradiction with mass and gravity and their dematerialization into surface.",
        "On the other hand, from our present perspective, the logic of the surface is a perceptual logic we must now understand as having been given to us by consumer communication culture and its slick advertising two dimensionality.",
        "\u201cScreen architecture\u201d? \u201cClone architecture\u201d? Or singular object.",
        "It is the particular handling of the surface that must make a difference.",
        "As Nouvel has commented on his Cartier Foundation: \u201cIf I look at the facade, since it\u2019s bigger than the building, I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m looking at the reflection of the sky or at the sky through the glass_If I look at a tree through the three glass panes, I can never determine if I\u2019m looking at the tree through the glass, in front of it, behind it, or the reflection of the tree.",
        "And when I plant two trees in parallel, even accidentally, to the glass plane, I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s a second tree or if it\u2019s a real tree.\u201d For Baudrillard, this form of illusion is not gratuitous; in his essay \u201cTruth or Radicality in Architecture,\u201d he referred to it as a \u201cdramaturgy of illusion and seduction.\u201d Such destabilizations of perception thwart the dictatorship of the smoothly visible and install an alternative perception, a \"secret image,\u201d an almost bodily recalcitrance (Barthes\u2019s punctum is mentioned as a model), which will make itself felt as a kind of resistance, lag, or refraction beneath the transparency.",
        "An object both of Foreword [] xiK a culture and the culture\u2019s biggest threat, then: pained by the loss, anticipating the gain, a representation of the moment and a momentary refusal.",
        "The singular object is deeply conflicted, and the conversation here takes on its subject\u2019s form.",
        "We can\u2019t go on; we must go on.",
        "The architect stretching to imagine what it would take to actually make a singular object, the philosopher insisting that no intention, no amount of individual effort, can guarantee singularity\u2019s arrival (\u201clet\u2019s not think too much\u201d).",
        "Both against premature clarification: I know it\u2019s here, but I can\u2019t see it; \u201cthe important thing is to have looked.\u201d Rarely can so many conflicting things be said about a singular subject.",
        "Rarely has such conflict been so productive.",

        "If I examine the truth of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, for example, I see that, in that location, architecture expresses, signifies, translates a kind of full, constructed form, the context of a society already experiencing hyperrealism.",
        "Those two towers resemble two perforated bands.",
        "Today we\u2019d probably say they\u2019re clones of each other, that they\u2019ve already been cloned.",
        "Did they anticipate our present? Does that mean that architecture is not part of reality but part of the fiction of a society, an anticipatory illusion? Or does architecture simply translate what is already there? That\u2019s why I asked, \u201cIs there such a thing as architectural truth?\u201d in the sense that there would be a suprasensible destination for architecture and for space.",

        "I took notes on some of your thoughts about our architectural monstrosities and some of your more radical points of view, which could supply us with a number of questions.",
        "If we attempt to talk about architecture as a limit\u2014and that\u2019s what really interests me\u2014we do so by always positioning ourselves on the fringe of knowledge and ignorance.",

        "You said, somewhere, that a consensus must exist in order for seduction to occur.",

        "I think Deleuze, in Proust and Signs, spoke about it from a different point of view.",
        "This diversion, which reroutes our perception of phenomena from the material to the immaterial, is a concept that architecture should appropriate for itself.",
        "Using these kinds of concepts, we can create more than what we see.",
        "And this \u201cmore than what we see\u201d is manifest in and through physical context.",
        "With respect to what architecture has borrowed from cinema, the concept of sequence is very important, as Paul Virilio reminds us.",
        "In other words, concepts such as displacement, speed, memory seen in terms of an imposed trajectory, or a known trajectory, enable us to compose an architectural space based not only on what we see but on what we have memorized as a succession of sequences that are perceived to follow one another.",
        "From this point on, there are contrasts between what is created and what was originally present in our perception of space.",
        "In the Versailles Theater, you enter through a stone corridor, which is absolutely neutral, plain, devoid of decoration, and which opens suddenly into something absolutely stunning in terms of its decoration, its preciosity.",

        "At the same time, when I play with the concept of a virtual space, in the magician\u2019s sense, it\u2019s because space and architecture are things we become conscious of through our 8 0 Flrstlaterview eyes.",

        "These are the means by which architecture creates a virtual space or a mental space; it\u2019s a way of tricking the senses.",

        "That\u2019s where the game is played.",

        "When you stand in front of the buildings, you see them, but they\u2019re invisible to the extent that they effectively counteract that hegemonic visibility, the visibility that dominates us, the visibility of the system, where everything must be immediately visible and immediately interpretable.",

        "In your work, I feel it in the effect produced by this illusion you spoke of earlier; not in the sense of an illusion or a trompe l\u2019oeil\u2014well, ultimately, yes, of course, but not an illusion in the sense of a simulation\u2014of something that takes place beyond the reflection of things or beyond the screen.",

        "It seems to me that everything you do, and do well, is another architecture First Interview [] 11 I /\"~ seen through a screen.",

        "And here I\u2019d like to know, as part of this question of context, what happens to social and political data, to everything that can constrain things, when architecture is tempted to become the expression, or even the sociological or political transformer, of a social reality, which is an illusion\u2014in the negative sense of the term.",
        "In one sense, even if architecture wants to respond to a political program or fulfill social needs, it will never succeed because it is confronted, fortunately, by something that is also a black hole.",
        "And this black hole simply means that the \u201cmasses\u201d are still there and they are not at all recipients, or conscious, or reflected, or anything; it\u2019s an extremely perverse operator with respect to everything that is constructed.",
        "So even if architecture wants what it wants and tries to signify what it wants to express, it will be deflected.",
        "You, however, strive for this deflection and destabilization, and you\u2019re right.",
        "And as we discussed, it\u2019s going to happen anyway.",

        "People don\u2019t always want to tell you \u201chow,\u201d they don\u2019t want to reveal their strategy, but rather want to create an aura of mystery that\u2019s essential for a certain type of seduction.",
        "The Question of Style J.B.",
        "In Buenos Aires the presentation of buildings by different architects, all of them well known, lasted five days.",
        "There was never a question of the mystery you speak of, only the nature of the projects, the development of a program, the results obtained, the international career of the person exposing his or her work.",
        "With respect to this sense of mystery, what we saw was incredibly impoverished.",
        "We are dealing with thickness, something that will never be totally elucidated, deciphered.",
        "There will always have to be things that remain unsaid and things in which we lose ourselves.",
        "At the same time, an architectural work should be capable of being experienced by people with very different sensibilities.",
        "So we have to set up a certain number of markers that can capture the attention or the interest of this highly diverse group.",
        "In a number of fields, this kind of sociological calculation is barely functional.",

        "So it's possible, ultimately.",
        "It's as if the architect were able to build without first reviewing the field of architecture, its history, and everything that is constructed.",
        "The ability to create a vacuum is undoubtedly the prerequisite for any act of authentic creation.",
        "If you don\u2019t create a vacuum, you\u2019ll never achieve singularity.",
        "You may produce remarkable things, but the heritage you have to deal with is such that you\u2019ll have to pass through a whole genetics of accumulation.",
        "Yes, but that doesn\u2019t rule out a strategy to flush out...",
        "Architecture can\u2019t be as spontaneous as writing.",
        "Certainly.",
        "Still, what characterizes architecture is its writing, the fact that we are able to recognize any detail at all.",
        "This doesn\u2019t only involve an exterior shape.",
        "And if you look at all the great architects of this century\u2014Wright, Le Corbusier, Aalto, Kahn\u2014you can recognize them by the details.",
        "This singularity of their architecture is remarkable.",
        "There must be something natural and spontaneous in it, but at the same time, it\u2019s planned, worked on, premeditated.",
        "You could say predestined.",
        "This activity of premeditation is the thing architecture needs the most at this time.",

        "This was true during the thirties, and it\u2019s still true today when people like Starck succeed in transforming a place.",
        "Do they still speak of style in architecture? Because compared to singularity, I would like to know what style is______We recognize someone who has style, but the work produced won\u2019t necessarily be the embodiment of a singular vision.",
        "Except if the style happens to be a singular vision___It\u2019s one of the big questions in architecture.",
        "Style addresses the problem of the evolution of architecture.",
        "We can say that architects, in the twentieth century, have positioned themselves as artists in the plastic arts.",
        "They\u2019ve appropriated the field; they\u2019ve pretended it was also their own.",
        "Once this formal identification was made, the number of caricatures began to multiply: the ones who made everything white or everything blue, all in garlands, and so on.",

        "A style, in my sense of the term, is something different.",
        "Style is a way of doing.",
        "But I can also suggest another definition______Personally, I\u2019m very inter ested in the way a style works, which has presented a problem\u2014 concerning me\u2014for certain critics or certain individuals, who wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s this guy doing?\u201d When an architect\u2019s way of doing something is identified, the way we recognize his style is as well.",

        "We manage to make things that are profound only through complicity, and perhaps only through this complicity do we achieve a certain degree of complexity, which isn\u2019t an end in itself.",
        "Often things are complex when they have to be, quite simply.",
        "This preliminary search for complexity has long been associated with a theory that claims that interesting things have to be complex because we then escape from a completely repetitive form of simplicity.",
        "The idea of complicity in architecture is more unusual, more uncommon.",
        "Complicity is the only guarantee that we\u2019ll be able to push the boundaries.",
        "But we need to consider this in a very broad sense.",
        "If this complicity is established, it means that something more than simple comprehension is going on between people, a shared meaning, mutual assistance.",
        "Obviously, I can\u2019t build the Cartier Foundation building if I don\u2019t establish a relationship of complicity with the person who conceived and manages it.",
        "And this complicity has to exist among the crew, an enterprise, a global project.",

        "The freedom of a subject struggling with his freedom is something else.",
        "Today we have an individual who isn\u2019t struggling with anything but who has set himself the goal of realizing himself in every possible dimension.",
        "We can\u2019t really postulate the problem of freedom.",
        "It\u2019s no more than a kind of operationality.",

        "No, not exactly.",
        "What would freedom mean within an ideological field that is no longer the same? Freedom in a state of subjection, want, is an idea and, at the same time, a kind of destiny: you desire it, you look for it.",
        "Liberation is not at all the same thing as freedom.",
        "That\u2019s what I wanted to make clear.",
        "When you\u2019re free, when you think you\u2019re living a realized freedom, it\u2019s a trap.",

        "The sexes find their sexual identity, and nothing more is shared between them, they exist in their own bubble.",
        "Alterity? Freedom is charged with a heavy load of remorse.",
        "And the liberation of people, in the historical sense of the term, is also a fantastic deception.",
        "There is always an element of the unthinkable that won\u2019t have been evacuated.",
        "So there\u2019s a kind of remorse because of what\u2019s transpired.",
        "We\u2019re free\u2014so what? Everything begins at the point where, in reality, we have the impression that something was supposed to be fulfilled.",
