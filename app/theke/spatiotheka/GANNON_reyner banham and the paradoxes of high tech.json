    "content": "On 15 December 1987, the British architectural historian and critic Reyner Banham wrote to the publisher Axel Menges to provide an update on his latest book project. Two years earlier, Menges had suggested that Banham \u201cwrite a book...that integrates today's High tech architecture (Foster, Rogers, Piano, Mangiarotti, etc.) into a tradtion [sic] of almost 200 years of technologically oriented architecture.\u201d1 With Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech, Banham planned to answer Menges\u2019s request with a detailed account of the movement\u2019s defining characteristics, historical sources, main practitioners, and implications for late twentieth century architectural culture. He included with his letter a summary of his argument, a draft outline of the book\u2019s contents, and an \u201cextensively re written introductory chapter,\u201d which, he claimed, \u201crepresented] his current thinking on the subject.\u201d2 At the time, Banham was in the process of relocating from his home in Santa Cruz, California, to New York City, where he had been named the Sheldon H. Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at New York University\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts. The book, he explained, would have to be put on hold until he and his wife, Mary, had completed their move, and he was able \u201cto get [himself] into a High Tech writing frame of mind.\u201d3 Unfortunately, the following weeks did not go as planned. The cancer for which Banham had undergone surgery the previous summer had returned, and he relocated not to New York but rather to London, where he succumbed to the disease on 19 March 1988. Banham\u2019s death at the age of sixty six silenced one of architecture\u2019s most distinctive voices, and his unfinished project on High Tech points to lacunae in the history of late twentieth century architecture that have persisted into the present. Though several publications have been devoted to the work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and other architects associated with High Tech, only a few general treatments of the movement exist, and the topic remains largely Piano + Rogers (Renzo Piano, Italian, b. 1937; Richard Rogers, British, b. Italy, 1933). Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris, 1977) General view (detail). Photo by Michel Denance. See p. 222, pi. 13. unexplored by twenty first century scholars.4 Similarly, Banham\u2019s late career work on High Tech has been little discussed in the growing literature on his influential writing and thinking. In the present book, I address these lacunae with a detailed examination of writings by Banham from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period that coincides with the prehistory and maturation of High Tech architecture. Chapters focus on key moments in Banham\u2019s early engagement with the New Brutalism of Alison and Peter Smithson; his measured enthusiasm for various \u201cclip on\u201d approaches pursued by the Archigram group, Cedric Price, and others; his advocacy of \u201cwell tempered environments\u201d fostered by integrated mechanical and electrical systems; and his late career assessments of Foster, Piano, Rogers, and other High Tech practitioners. I complement these textual analyses with close readings of salient architectural projects of the period, not to provide a comprehensive historical treatment of High Tech but rather to bring into sharper relief the relationship between Banham\u2019s argumentation and specific qualities of the buildings and projects he chose to examine and, in a few important cases, to avoid. In contrast to other studies that focus on Banham\u2019s early writings and many extradisciplinary interests, I devote significant attention to Banham\u2019s late writings on High Tech, including archival materials held at the Getty Research Institute related to his unfinished manuscript. Banham\u2019s previously unpublished draft introduction to Making Architecture, \u201cHigh Tech and Advanced Engineering,\u201d has been included. As Banham planned to demonstrate, High Tech was plagued by ambiguities. On one hand, it was seen as a visual style based on easily graspable tropes such as exposed structure and mechanical services. On the other, it was understood as an attitude toward building particularly attentive to social relations and functional performance. Critics of the period seized on these apparent antinomies to charge the movement \u2014 and often along with it modern architecture more generally\u2014 with crimes ranging from contextual insensitivity to capitulation to capitalism. Banham, by contrast, saw in High Tech a reinvigoration of the visual qualities and guiding principles upon which modern architecture had been founded. For him, High Tech represented the continuation of an \u201cother modern architecture,\u201d one that developed alongside the canonical International Style of the 1920s and \u201930s and traced its genealogy through lesser known constructivist sources to \u201cles grands constructeurs\u201d of nineteenth century engineering.5 This \u201calternative Modernism,\u201d Banham claimed, could counter not only what he viewed as the cliched tropes of the International Style but also the anachronisms of the then ascendant idiom of postmodern architecture.6 As is well known, Banham often railed against entrenched conventions and dominant traditions in twentieth century architecture, and several commentators have addressed the distinctly antiestablishment current that runs through his writings. In a 1999 treatment, Panayotis Tournikiotis concentrated almost exclusively on Banham\u2019s first book, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i960), in which, he argued, Banham \u201cexposes the real modern movement in order to be able to reject it.\u201d7 Anthony Vidler, in an excellent assessment, linked Banham closely to his mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner, and demonstrated important links between Banham\u2019s modernism and Pevsner\u2019s advocacy of the picturesque tradition. Vidler\u2019s Banham articulated a \u201cFuturist Modernism,\u201d with a \u201ccall for a posttechnological, postacademic, even postarchitectural discourse\u201d in his writings of the 1950s and \u201960s,8 a call Banham answered with Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971), Scenes in America Deserta (1982), and other texts. Nigel Whiteley, in a comprehensive critical biography, ultimately conjured a pragmatist Banham. \u201cPragmatism and its associated values,\u201d he concluded, \u201cunderlay Banham\u2019s architectural thinking and freed his mind from the sort of dogma that had infiltrated much modernist thinking.\u201d9 Though I at times take issue with points made by my predecessors, I do not aim in the present book to contradict earlier interpretations. The Banham I present here exists alongside Tournikiotis\u2019s antiestablishment Banham, Vidler\u2019s futurist Banham, and Whiteley\u2019s pragmatist Banham. But where earlier narratives focus on Banham\u2019s well known impatience with disciplinary conventions, I draw attention to his simultaneous and seemingly contradictory embrace of the traditional values inscribed in those very conventions. This somewhat paradoxical Banham was as prone to quip that \u201carchitects who genuinely see how narrow and restricting are the traditions of their profession normally get out of it,\u201d as he was, just a few lines later, to endorse \u201ca world in which \u2018architect\u2019 is a meaningful and productive category of human being.\u201d10 This Banham is possible not because he famously \u201cchanged his mind\u201d over the course of his career,11 but rather because he tended to structure his arguments around persistent antinomies \u2014 tradition versus technology, aesthetics versus ethics, style versus performance \u2014 that he saw as key features of modern architecture and central to his discussion of High Tech.12 Drawing attention to these dialectics, particularly as they played out in Banham\u2019s late writings, brings to light important aspects of his thinking that to date have gone unexamined. Few have noticed, for example, that the \u201cother modern architecture\u201d Banham outlined in later texts was not identical with his earlier idea of une architecture autref3 or that his late career formulation of \u201cmaking architecture,\u201d which involved \u201cclarity and frugality in resolving functional problems within the canons of architecture,\u201d does not square easily with the antiestablishment agenda for which he is so often celebrated.14 Revisiting earlier writings with the concept of \u201cmaking architecture\u201d in mind not only clarifies Banham\u2019s various postulations of otherness in architecture but also reveals an other Banham, one committed not only to discrediting entrenched conventions and dissolving disciplinary boundaries but also to maintaining and strengthening core traditions and values. This more \u201cpractice oriented\u201d Banham provides a unique lens through which to reexamine High Tech architecture.15 Banham\u2019s early writings on the modem movement and the New Brutalism, his midcareer advocacy of the Archigram group and various \u201cclip on\u201d approaches, and his elevation of environmental technologies in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment (1969) deal directly with the movement\u2019s primary antecedents, while his late writings on the work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Richard Rogers remain some of the most valuable treatments of High Tech and its main exponents. A reevaluation of Banham\u2019s engagement with High Tech not only unsettles prevailing opinions regarding one of the twentieth century\u2019s most influential architectural historians, but also sheds new light on an important movement in architecture that has received scant critical analysis Before proceeding, some ground clearing of key terms is in order. Following Ban ham, I oscillate between using the term High Tech as a label specific to certain works of architecture dating primarily to the 1970s and \u201980s and as a more general description of any object that promises (whether or not it delivers) technological innovation or enhanced performance.16 Though the literature is not always consistent in this regard, as far as possible, capitalization signals the former sense of the term. Such consistency is more difficult to maintain with other important terms including modern, modernist, modernism, the modern movement, and the International Style. Banham often used these terms interchangeably, as in the second edition of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, which begins, \u201cThe \u2018Modern Movement\u2019 or \u2018The International Style\u2019 has had a long and productive life in architecture\u201d;17 at the outset of A Concrete Atlantis: U.S. Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture (1986), where he discussed \u201cthe classic modernist architecture of the International Style in Europe\u201d;18 and in the introduction to Making Architecture, where he referred to \u201cthe older Modernism of the International Style.\u201d19 Given such usage, a full disambiguation of his terminology is not possible. Nonetheless, it is important to approach the chapters that follow with an understanding of Banham\u2019s signal concern with questions of style, particularly the International Style, which he claimed in 1980 to be \u201cthe dominant style of our present century,\u201d20 and which he later noted had been his \u201cprime subject of study\u201d as a historian.21 Alfred J. Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is usually credited with coining the term somewhere around 1930,22 and it acquired its canonical air as the title of Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson\u2019s famous 1932 book of the same name23 The modern movement, on the other hand, is closely associated with Pioneers of the Modern Movement, the classic 1936 study written by Banham\u2019s dissertation adviser and mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner.24 In the present book, both International Style and modern movement usually refer to the ambiguous cluster of visual characteristics and sociopolitical values associated with the architecture of Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and related figures dating primarily to the 1920s and \u201930s and occasionally stretching back into the late nineteenth century and forward into the postwar period.25 As Banham used them, these terms typically retain a close association with Barr, Hitchcock, Johnson, Pevsner, and, for reasons that become clear below, Sigfried Giedion, and they often imply the shortcomings he found in those authors\u2019 formulations. Modern architecture is best understood in this context as a broader term that encompasses the canonical work of the 1920s and \u201930s, as well as later developments, including the New Brutalism, clip on architecture, and High Tech. This broadness greatly blunts the term\u2019s precision, as Banham acknowledged in his 1962 Guide to Modern Architecture. Given that modern architecture appeared to have \u201cgrown up\u201d by midcentury, he explained, the term could no longer stand exclusively for the \u201cbang up to date, born yesterday, as of now attributes\u201d that characterized the major achievements of the interwar years.26 It would be better, he surmised, to take it simply to mean \u201cnot old\u201d27 and to see the white walled, flat roofed, patent glazed consistency of the International Style as representing the \u201cteenage uniform of modern architecture.\u201d28 Extending Banham\u2019s metaphor, one might usefully understand the New Brutalist, clip on, and High Tech works discussed in this book as attempts to devise appropriate garments for a more mature phase of modern architecture in the latter half of the twentieth century. It is also important to note Banham\u2019s tendency to see modern architecture not simply as a style within the even broader category of \u201carchitecture\u201d but rather as constituting the whole of the field. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t modern nowadays,\u201d he wrote in 1962, \u201cit isn\u2019t architecture anymore, but archaeology, cowardice, or fancy dress.\u201d29 Banham\u2019s tendency to draw disciplinary boundaries by a process of exclusion figures strongly in my narrative, particularly in his late career treatment of High Tech and what he saw as its main stylistic adversary, postmodern architecture.30 Of course, modern and its many variants carry implications well beyond issues of style. The modern movement, for example, baldly implies action and, as Pevsner used it, signifies not only a stylistic category but also a cultural impetus, the collective ambition of a group of people who had placed the machine in a privileged position within society and artistic production.31 Banham certainly subscribed to this central place for mechanical technology in any conception of a modern movement, and maintained it in his own formulation of various \u201cmachine ages\u201d throughout his career. Related and somewhat loftier terms such as modernity and modernism, while occasionally used by Banham in reference to style, more often imply a cultural condition associated with self conscious innovation and distinct \u2014 if not always total \u2014ruptures between the often anxious inhabitants of a turbulent present and the established traditions and conventions of the past.32 This extended explication of terminojogy has been made necessary by Banham\u2019s persistent use of finely tuned, often dialectically structured terminological distinctions throughout his writing. Consider, for example, his 1955 gloss on the two main types of \u201cisms\u201d associated with the modern movement: \u201cOne, like Cubism, is a label, a recognition tag, applied by critics and historians to a body of work which appears to have certain consistent principles running through it, whatever the relationship of the artists; the other, like Futurism, is a banner, a slogan, a policy consciously adopted by a group of artists, whatever the apparent similarity or dissimilarity of their products.\u201d33 With this succinct partitioning of the modern movement\u2019s formal and ideological inflections, Banham set up his famous characterization of the New Brutalism as a contest between aesthetics and ethics.34 A similar structure is apparent in his 1960 \u201cstocktaking\u201d of contemporary architecture, in which he opposed the \u201coperational lore\u201d of disciplinary tradition with the \u201capparent intelligence\u201d of advanced technology,35 and in his planned exegesis of High Tech according to a fundamental tension between visual style and functional performance. A similar set of oppositional themes structures my narrative. First among them is Banham\u2019s commitment to architecture\u2019s accommodation of human subjects, a commitment that drove him to challenge core tenets of architectural humanism.36 Second is Banham\u2019s repeated postulation of the fundamental necessity of a coherent visual image to any architecture. This allegiance to the image often put Banham at odds with the suspicion of architectural formalism he maintained throughout his career and tempered his brash antiestablishmentarianism with a conspicuous respect for certain of the field\u2019s long standing habits and expectations. Finally, attention is paid to Banham\u2019s persistent evocation of the disappearance of architecture in the face of other modes of design. This enthusiastic promotion of visual dissipation stands in stark contrast to his commitment to bold architectural imagery and mirrors other thematic oppositions that charge his writings, as well as the architecture he wrote about, with a provocative tension that remained both productive and unresolved throughout his oeuvre. Banham\u2019s engagement with these dialectics resonates with other oppositions he made thematic in his writing. In the 1960s and \u201970s, Banham proposed Homo Ludens, the theoretical \u201cman at play\u201d first conceived by Johan Huizinga,37 as an alternative to the classical concept of the Vitruvian Man. Just as the Vitruvian Man stood for the idealized human subject addressed by classical and modern humanists, Homo Ludens provided a theoretical personification of the alternative audience Banham wished to engage with his technologically progressive agenda. Banham often invoked Homo Ludens while rhapsodizing the indeterminate programmatic accumulations made possible by new technologies and made popular by progressive youth culture. Yet while he tirelessly championed Homo Ludens s distracted subjectivity, Banham cultivated in himself and encouraged in his contemporaries the keen eye and rapt attention of a humanist connoisseur. Further, though one might expect Banham\u2019s support of programmatic indeterminacy to extend to the objects from which it issued, visually inconsistent works the fractured and disintegrated forms increasingly favored by the architects of his generation found, at best, an ambivalent ally in Banham. The historian who introduced architecture to the formal juxtapositions of clip on architecture routinely chose visually integrated works as models for the otherness he sought, articulating qualities such as absolute consistency,\u201d38 \u201cconvincing unity of the total effect, 39 and a unified aesthetic for structure and services\u201d40 to describe them. If visual unity was not readily apparent, Banham responded at times with searing criticism, at others with conspicuous silence, and occasionally with cunning invocations of invisibility. A survey of Banham\u2019s major books attests to the oscillating themes that pervade his writings. Banham\u2019s first and still widely read book, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i960), famously concludes by announcing the potential disappearance of architecture in the face of technology. His Guide to Modern Architecture (1962), by contrast, ends with a close reading of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s meticulous details. After The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic? (1966), his chronicle of the idiom for which he developed the idea of \u201cbuilding as an \u2018image,\u2019\u201d41 Banham moved on to The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment (1969), Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971), and, later, Scenes in America Deserta (1982), books that draw attention to mechanical systems, urban structures, and natural phenomena that previously had been overlooked by the field. With Age of the Masters: A Personal View of Modern Architecture (1975), Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (1976), A Concrete Atlantis: U.S. Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture, 1900 1925 (1986), and The Visions of Ron Herron (completed 1988, published 1994), Banham turned his attention toward more specifically architectural (and imagistic) concerns before outlining a complex interplay of arresting imagery and a contrasting dissipation of visible form for the unfinished Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech. Exactly how Banham intended to develop his notion of High Tech\u2019s \u201cparadoxes is difficult to discern. The archive holds nothing specific on the topic beyond a brief description of a planned closing chapter to Making Architecture titled \u201cThe Paradoxes of High Tech,\u201d which focused on the \u201cextremes and limitations of High Tech as an architectural genre, [the] penalties of a maintainance intensive [sic] architecture, the consequences of the information revolution, [and a] summing up of [the] present position.\u201d42 Nonetheless, Banham\u2019s attraction to paradoxical formulations is evident throughout his work,43 and his persistent use of seeming contradictions aligns neatly with the philosopher Susanne K. Langer\u2019s description of the phenomenon: \u201cAn absurd term or self contradictory proposition that continues to function in serious, systematic thought, although its logical scandal is patent, is paradoxical.\u201d44 Langer\u2019s formulation comes from her influential 1953 book, Feeling and Form, in which she laid out a theory aimed at resolving the antinomies she found to be both rife and debilitating in writings about art. While many authors postulated a simple polarity between opposed terms as sufficient to accommodate persistent contradictions, Langer insisted that such formulations be resolved. \u201cThe conception of polarity,\u201d she claimed, \u201cintriguing though it be, is really an unfortunate metaphor whereby a logical muddle is raised to the dignity of a fundamental principle.\u201d45 For Langer, the primary function of any art form was symbolic expression. In too many cases, she argued, a clear understanding of this fact was obscured by the tendency of writers (and artists) to incorrectly elevate an associated but ultimately irrelevant term in their formulations. \u201cEach art,\u201d she wrote, \u201chas its special incubus of natural misconceptions\u201d that arises from poorly formulated polarities. She continued, \u201cThe affliction of literature is its relation to fact, propositional truth; of drama, its nearness to moral questions; of dance, the personal element, the sensual interest; of painting and sculpture, the pseudo problem of \u2018imitation\u2019; of architecture, the obvious fact of utility.\u201d46 Langer proposed to resolve the paradoxical relation between utility and expression in architecture by exposing the irrelevance of the former term. \u201cThe created space of architecture,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis a symbol of functional existence. This does not mean, however, that signs of important activities \u2014 hooks for implements, convenient benches, well planned doors \u2014 play any part in its significance....Symbolic expression is something miles removed from provident planning or good arrangement.\u201d47 Banham was certainly familiar with Langer\u2019s work; he even structured a 1964 lecture for the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) in direct response to the passage cited above. Admitting that \u201cthe obvious fact of utility has always been one of the stumbling blocks in the critical evaluation of architecture as an art,\u201d48 Banham went on to argue that Langer\u2019s attitude toward utility, though seductive as a general theory, was impossible to maintain in the criticism of individual buildings. Utility, Banham claimed, must remain a primary concern, and symbolic expression should arise naturally from functional necessity. As an example, he offered the highly ritualized collection of benches, hooks, and other functional elements in a traditional Norwegian farmhouse. In these, he argued, expression and utility collapse into one another and cannot be distinguished. Langer, he concluded, had gotten it backward: \u201cHad Suzanne [s/c] Langer been an architect rather than the inventor of a systematic study of visual symbols, she would probably have said that it was symbolic expression and not utility which was the affliction of architecture.\u201d49 But if, for Banham, symbolic expression was architecture\u2019s \u201caffliction,\u201d it was a necessary one. Though he occasionally treated aesthetic issues with a degree of impatience, he scrupulously maintained them throughout his formulations. \u201cPart of the business of being an architect and/or an architectural critic,\u201d he explained, \u201cis that you are dealing among other things (and I insist on \u2018among other things\u2019)... with visual symbols which are acceptable or not acceptable, for fashionable reasons, for personal reasons, irrespective of the functions that the building has to serve.\u201d50 Thus, for Banham, architecture\u2019s seemingly irreconcilable obligations to both aesthetics and ethics, to tradition and technology, to style and performance were not conceptual \u201cmuddles\u201d to be resolved through the abstract logic of the philosopher but rather were part of the actual circumstances involved in the design of buildings and as such were to be accounted for through the descriptive methods of the architectural critic and historian. While Banham was sensitive to the differences between the activities of a critic and those of a historian,51 in his ACSA address, he closely linked the tasks of the two professions, casting them not in opposition to each other but rather joining them in their common concern for specificity and in contrast to theory\u2019s necessary tendency toward generalization. As he put it, \u201cThe production of a properly generalized theory of architecture really involves leaving out the particulars. If you are going to begin to generalize, then your final intellectual construct, document, or whatever which embodies the theory will have to leave out pretty well all the particulars in order to achieve a general rule. But, presented with a particular building on a particular site, criticism, evaluation, history cannot proceed in the absence of such particulars.\u201d52 Thus linked to the specific qualities of the object of investigation, in Banham\u2019s view, both history and criticism required a primarily descriptive methodology, with the ultimate goal \u201cto make clear how and why the building got to be the way it is.\u201d53 He maintained this commitment to what he later termed \u201cobservational\u201d history throughout his career.54 And though he often assumed a highly polemical posture and proved to be a formidable influence on his contemporaries, Banham\u2019s principal focus was not to advocate a personal vision of how architects should conduct themselves (even if he occasionally gave this very impression) but rather to provide dispassionate documentation and evaluation of the actual circumstances in which they did so. If paradoxical formulations were among the hows and whys that brought a building into being, then they, and whatever \u201clogical scandal\u201d they carried with them, must necessarily find their place in the history of architecture. Importantly, for Banham, the task of the historian extended beyond mere description and evaluation. \u201cAll major works of historical philosophy,\u201d he opined, \u201cextrapolate present trends into the future condition of men.\u201d55 A historian did not simply document the events of the past but also outlined what he termed the \u201cHistory of the Immediate Future.\u201d At the outset of his career, Banham saw in the immediate future the impending maturation of a second machine age, an era of individually focused mechanical technology and truly progressive architecture that finally would bring about the unkept promises of the heroic modern pioneers. As he put it in 1980, \u201cWhat had been promised by the First Machine Age, but never properly delivered, now [in 1960] seemed to be at hand.\u201d56 Of course, Banham understood such predictions were fallible, noting in 1961 that current events are prone to \u201cdevelop characteristics which you could hardly have expected from earlier results.\u201d57 Banham grappled with unexpected developments in modern architecture throughout his career, and by the 1980s, a melancholic tone had entered his writings. A passage from his introduction to the second edition of Theory and Design attests: \u201cEvery now and again the Machine Aesthetic will produce a burst of creative speed, but in general this grand old vehicle is nowadays just sputtering its way to the junkyard.\u201d58 Yet, at the same time that Banham was lamenting the decline of modern architecture, Foster, Piano, Rogers, and other High Tech practitioners were putting up what he judged to be \u201cthe best buildings that are actually being built in Europe and North America,\u201d and they were doing so with all of modern architecture\u2019s \u201cmythologies (social, economic, technological) still intact.\u201d59 In buildings such as Foster\u2019s Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters (completed 1974) in Ipswich, England, and Piano + Rogers\u2019s Centre Georges Pompidou (completed 1977) in Paris, Banham found a reinvigorated modern architecture, both technologically advanced and aesthetically persuasive, perfectly suited to address the challenges presented by everyday as well as monumental commissions.60 Eschewing the often arcane rhetoric of postmodern architecture, High Tech architects, like Banham himself, wagered that the best strategy to produce a viable architecture for the late twentieth century was not to abandon modern architecture\u2019s founding principles but rather to stand firm in unwavering commitment to them. This study begins with an overview of Banham\u2019s early career and the postwar context in which he matured, devoting significant attention to his promotion of the New Brutalism and his development of the concept of une architecture autre. Revisiting Banham\u2019s enthusiasm for early exponents of the clip on approach and his curiously tepid response to later built works in that idiom reveal two important tensions: one between his advocacy of extreme programmatic diversity and his insistence on coherent visual unity in the works he supported, and another stemming from his simultaneous endorsement of the immersive experience of distracted building occupants and of the critical distance traditionally associated with attentive connoisseurs. An examination of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, Banham\u2019s most aggressive postulation of an architecture of technology, alongside competing theoretical agendas advanced by his talented pupil, Charles Jencks, foregrounds Banham\u2019s simultaneous commitment to the monumental imagery of traditional architecture and to the dissipation of visual form he so often found in progressive applications of technology to building. Later chapters devoted specifically to High Tech architecture examine Banham\u2019s early endorsement of projects by Foster, Piano, Rogers, and others and outline the development of his thinking in late writings including archival materials related to Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech. In these texts, Banham assumed a staunchly critical stance to postmodern architecture and labored to make a case for the continued validity of modern architecture. I continue with analyses of little studied late works by Ban ham, including his posthumously published book on Archigram member Ron Herron, in which Banham suggests that architecture might productively be understood to exist independently of buildings. My narrative concludes with an investigation of an alternative trajectory outlined in Banham\u2019s late writings that points to the possibility of a mode of building unencumbered by architectural convention. In the pages that follow, I devote significant attention to oft overlooked themes such as formal organization, construction details, programmatic accommodation, and the role of disciplinary convention. While these themes carry my investigations deep into the realm of building construction, my aim is not to assert the primacy of traditional building in the history of late twentieth century architecture or to twenty first century practice. Instead, I argue that it was exactly attempts to project architecture beyond building that led architects from the 1950s to the 1980s to reexamine\u2014 and ultimately to reinforce\u2014traditional disciplinary values. And, in tracing a parallel commitment to rational, accommodative construction from the New Brutal ism to High Tech, I demonstrate that a little studied trajectory of seemingly orthodox works came much closer to Banham\u2019s call for viable alternatives to conventional practice by suggesting a paradoxical mode of building beyond architecture.

Reyner Banham\u2019s entree into British architectural circles in the 1950s coincided with a period of contentious debate regarding the future of modern architecture. Though as late as i960 Nikolaus Pevsner would argue that the \u201cstyle of the century\u201d he described twenty four years earlier in Pioneers of the Modern Movement was \u201cstill valid,\u201d1 the devastation of World War II led many to question the adequacy of prewar modernism to address the challenges of reconstruction. Such questions were particularly pressing in Great Britain. Modern architecture had arrived relatively late to the British context. Both before and after the war, its proponents, many of them (like Pevsner) emigres from the Continent, had struggled against perceptions of elitism and an increasingly nationalistic political climate to win broad support from the architectural establishment, institutional clients, and the general public.2 By the late 1940s, many British architects, critics, and historians had been experimenting with alternatives. For example, at the influential Architectural Review, where Pevsner served on the editorial board, a prewar editorial focus on modern architecture widened to allow for promiscuous affiliations ranging from popular art to the picturesque tradition. In private firms and municipal agencies, such as the Architect\u2019s Department of the London County Council (LCC), the so called Contemporary style, redolent of vernacular precedents, was adopted by a generation of architects committed to \u201chumanizing\u201d the built environment. In academic circles, the writings of Rudolf Wittkower and others sparked a renewed enthusiasm for classical proportions. The fine arts witnessed a similar questioning of the tenets of modernism, as interest in the supposedly timeless and universal qualities of modern art gave way in many circles to nationalism and neo romanticism. Banham was part of a generation of young artists and architects, many of them combat veterans, dismayed by these events, which they viewed to be largely backward looking, parochial, and sentimental. As Banham\u2019s widow, Mary, remembered, Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003). Hunstanton Secondary Modern School (Hunstanton, England, 1954). Interior view (detail). See p. 25, fig. i.n. \u201cWe, and our friends, were far more interested in the work of European architects, Le Corbusier particularly, rather than what we considered somewhat \u2018tame\u2019 British work.\u201d3 At the time, tempers ran hotter, particularly among artists in the Ban hams\u2019 circle, such as Eduardo Paolozzi and William Turnbull, whom Reyner Banham recalled as aiming with their work \u201cto kick Henry Moore in the teeth.\u201d4 With similar venom directed at the establishment, Alison and Peter Smithson developed their own ruthless version of modern architecture, the New Brutalism, in the early 1950s. And it was by linking the New Brutalism tightly to the ambitions of artists such as Paolozzi and Turnbull that Banham would fashion his famous call for une architecture autre. Both the New Brutalism and une architecture autre have received significant attention in recent scholarship.5 In a 1990 study, Nigel Whiteley found the concept of une architecture autre to be central to Banham\u2019s writing. \u201cUnderlying all Banham\u2019s criticism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas a commitment not to form nor even a system of aesthetics, but to an attitude. And it was this attitude \u2014derived from post war art autre with its undercurrent of anti traditionalism and anti convention \u2014 which was manifest throughout Banham\u2019s quest for an architecture autre.\u201d6 In a perceptive 2008 analysis, Anthony Vidler came to a somewhat different conclusion, noticing \u201cBanham\u2019s insistence on the role of aesthetics \u2014 of the viewer and in experience \u2014 in the promulgation of a new architecture,\u201d7 and arguing that Banham\u2019s \u201creal agenda with regard to \u2018une architecture autre\u2019... [was] a call for an architecture that technologically overcomes all previous architectures, to possess an expressive form.\u201d8 Thus, with one linking une architecture autre to an attitude and the other to a call for expressive form, Whiteley and Vidler together rehearsed exactly the tension Banham himself used to structure both The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?, his 1966 book on the movement, and his initial formulations of Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech, which he left unfinished two decades later. Indeed, many of the dialectics Banham planned to investigate in the latter book \u2014between style and performance, tradition and technology, architecture and the possibility of \u201cother\u201d alternatives \u2014were present in his early work on the New Brutalism and find their roots in British architectural debates of the 1950s. And though a surfeit of literature on these debates as well as Banham\u2019s role in them exists,9 their centrality to the formation of High Tech architecture necessitates a brief review of salient issues here. Background To begin, a few biographical notes offer some orientation.10 Peter Reyner Banham was born in Norwich, England, in 1922. He began engineering training at Bristol Technical College in 1939, but his study was cut short by the outbreak of World War II. He spent the war years as an engine fitter in the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and then he began writing art reviews for the local paper in Norwich after the war. Following their marriage in 1946, he and his wife, Mary, relocated to London, where he undertook a course of study in art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1949. Moving to Primrose Hill, London, in 1951 made the architect Colin St. John Wilson a neighbor and brought Banham into contact with a circle of ambitious young architects and artists, including Alan Colquhoun, Richard Hamilton, Nigel Henderson, Robert Maxwell, Eduardo Paolozzi, Alison and Peter Smithson, James Stirling, and William Turnbull, among others.11 Sunday morning coffee at the Banhams\u2019 flat became something of a ritual for the group, what Banham later described as \u201can invisible college of a remarkable kind.\u201d12 In 1952, he began doctoral studies at the Courtauld under the supervision of Nikolaus Pevsner. The following year, Pevsner invited him to join the staff of the Architectural Review, where Banham would remain until 1964.13 Thus, by 1953, Banham had fallen into close contact with two groups that would constitute the opposing sides of a debate over the legacy of modern architecture in postwar Britain. On one hand, Banham was aligned with the young artists and architects who would form the core of the Independent Group and would author some of England\u2019s most progressive buildings throughout the 1950s and \u201960s.14 On the other, he was employed at a prestigious establishment publication and was working both professionally and academically under Pevsner, arguably England\u2019s most venerated architectural historian.15 During his doctoral studies, Banham immersed himself in the literature of modern architecture. In addition to Pevsner\u2019s Pioneers of the Modern Movement, Banham identified Sigfried Giedion\u2019s Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton (1928) as a crucial text. Both authors located the sources of modern architecture in the nineteenth century, with the former crediting the English arts and crafts movement, art nouveau, and Victorian engineering as crucial antecedents and the latter offering technical advances in steel, reinforced concrete, and glass as seminal catalysts. Though one worked primarily through period styles and the other through building tectonics, both foregrounded historical continuities between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and argued that the canonical modern style was well in place by the 1910s. In 1932, Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson provided a seminal catalog of works in the modern idiom in their famous exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and its attendant publications, including The International Style: Architecture since 7922.16 In examining these and other works, Banham noticed what he termed a \u201czone of silence, extending from about 1910 to 1926\u201d in the historical literature.17 Pevsner, he observed, concluded his study in 1914 with the Werkbund exhibition at Cologne, while Giedion effectively terminated his in the nineteenth century. The canonical works associated with the International Style \u2014 Le Corbusier\u2019s classic villas, Walter Gropius\u2019s Bauhaus, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Barcelona Pavilion, and the modernist showcase at the Stuttgart WeiBenhofsiedlung (in which all three architects participated) \u2014 date to the latter half of the 1920s. \u201cIn the process of creating this Zone of Silence,\u201d Banham wrote, \u201ctwo alternative misconceptions were propagated\u2014one, always in favour with some group or another, that there were scandals to be hidden; the other, the official line until fairly recently, that the Modern Movement is a direct continuation of the Rationalism and Functionalism of the nineteenth century.\u201d18 Banham turned his attention toward the \u201czone of silence\u201d in his doctoral research, with a series of articles in the Architectural Review marking his progress.19 He labored to explain \u201caberrations\u201d such as Gropius\u2019s 1921 Sommerfeld House as part and parcel to the tumultuous aesthetic and political context of its day, and he was particularly attentive to the unacknowledged contribution of Italian futurists, German expressionists, Russian constructivists, and other groups in the formation of modern architecture.20 After completing his dissertation in 1958, he appended a polemical introduction and conclusion and published the results two years later as Theory and Design in the First Machine Age. If Banham\u2019s research into the misfit projects and personalities of modern architecture\u2019s early years demonstrated them to be lacking in scandal or embarrassment, his book exposed other questionable behavior in the period. In their propagandists zeal to give the impression of a coherent, focused, and apparently inevitable movement, he argued, \u201cmodern architects decided to cut off half their grandparents without a farthing.\u201d21 Major historical accounts of the period, he noted, tended to be \u201cselective and classicizing,\u201d22 written \u201cwith all the Futurists, Romantics, Expressionists, Elementarists, and pure aesthetes omitted.\u201d23 Further, continuities between modern architecture and nineteenth century sources were not so much a continuation of the earlier century\u2019s rationalism and functionalism, as Giedion and Pevsner had written, but rather a continuation of the academic conventions codified in the supposedly antithetical Ecole des Beaux Arts. Finally, and perhaps most damningly, modern architecture\u2019s close links to technology, epitomized in Le Corbusier\u2019s famous manifesto, Vers une architecture,24 proved upon examination literally to be whitewash, the plaster rendering concealing traditional blockwork at the Villa Savoye standing as an apt reification of Le Corbusier\u2019s overtures to technology, which Banham showed largely to be rhetorical veneer.25 Banham\u2019s book bolstered a younger generation whose interest in Continental modernism ran counter to mainstream developments in British architectural circles, which had taken a distinctly nationalistic turn during World War II.26 By the mid 1940s, the Architectural Review had begun a rehabilitation of the English picturesque tradition with a series of articles on the topic by Pevsner and others.27 This was a significant move on the part of the Review, which, under the influence of its eccentric proprietor, Hugh de Cronin Hastings, had been a dependable proponent of modern architecture since the 1930s.28 By the 1950s, the magazine had launched its promotion of Townscape, a mode of urban planning based on picturesque visual principles, the incorporation of existing vernacular construction, and an appeal to the inherent reasonableness of the English national character.29 The immediate postwar years in Great Britain also saw the victory of Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour party in the 1945 general election and with it a significant strengthening of the welfare state and a parallel institutionalization of the arts. Government agencies\u2014including the Council of Industrial Design, founded in 1944, and the Arts Council, chartered in 1946 \u2014promoted a leavening of Continental modern art and design with elements of British tradition, which coalesced, in painting and sculpture, into a form of neo romanticism based on nostalgic and often fictional portrayals of Britain\u2019s rural past and, in design and architecture, into the so called Contemporary style.30 Proponents of the Contemporary style drew inspiration from the socialist realism promoted in the Soviet Union since the 1930s by Andrei Zhdanov and from recent architecture in the established welfare state of Sweden. Prior to the war, modern architecture had had some success in Sweden, as evidenced by Sven Markelius\u2019s sober student union building at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm of 1930 and Erik Gunnar Asplund\u2019s more playful buildings for the Stockholmsutstdllningen (Stockholm exhibition) of the same year (fig. i.i). By the end of the decade, the supposed \u201cobjectivity\u201d of modern architecture, which Asplund already had challenged with his exhibition buildings, was more specifically called into question as Swedish architects sought to reintroduce traditional aspects of coziness and informality.31 In his 1937 Summer House at Stennas (fig. 1.2), for example, Asplund employed a casual massing and a traditional, if somewhat stripped down, vocabulary of plastered walls, high chimneys, and pitched roofs, while in fig. 1.1 Erik Gunnar Asplund (Swedish, 1885 1940).

Model. his celebrated buildings at the Woodland Cemetery in Stockholm, he combined aspects of modern and classical architecture in a bucolic setting. Asplund\u2019s later works became a model for younger Swedish architects such as Ralph Erskine and Sven Backstrom, whose projects neatly aligned with the ambitions of the burgeoning Townscape movement and were enthusiastically documented in the Architectural Review in the late 1940s under the banner of the New Empiricism.32 As Review editors developed these varied alternatives to prewar modern architecture, left leaning British architects, including many associated with the Architect\u2019s Department of the London County Council (at the time, the main employer of younger architects in London), adopted the Contemporary style through the use of the \u201cpeople\u2019s detailing,\u201d a vocabulary of pitched roofs, brick walls, small paned windows, and other traditional elements strongly reminiscent of Swedish precedents and sometimes referred to as the New Humanism (fig. i.3).33 These new \u201cisms\u201d often were conflated with each other and with the Contemporary style in the literature of the period,34 and they signaled \u2014 regional and temporal inflections notwithstanding\u2014a desire across British architectural culture to provoke a \u201cprogressive humanization of the Modern Movement.\u201d35 In 1951, these various strands came together in the design of the Festival of Britain (fig. 1.4).36 Frankly nationalistic in their ambitions, festival organizers excluded international participants and encouraged neoromanticism in the fine art they commissioned.37 The buildings of the main exhibition on London\u2019s South Bank contrasted the more traditional manner that dominated other festival sites with a formal vocabulary somewhat reminiscent\u2014particularly in the three hundred foot tall cable stayed Skylon \u2014 of Russian constructivism. The influence of Asplund\u2019s lighthearted interpretation of the International Style at the Stockholmsutstallningen also was apparent, as was that of the proponents of Townscape.38 Kenneth Framp ton, at the time a first year student at London\u2019s Architectural Association School, later remembered the South Bank festival site as \u201cvaguely Swedish...in its overall tone.\u201d39 The editors of the Architectural Review applauded the design for its resonance with the modern picturesque planning they advocated.40 Alongside the architects in his circle, Banham found little to celebrate in the Festival of Britain. While he later recalled an \u201cobservable internationalism\u201d in the festival architecture, he noted that among architects of his generation, \u201cthe Festival style was anathema.\u201d41 Colquhoun, the Smithsons, Stirling, Wilson, and other young architects bristled at the \u201chumanized\u201d and provincial modernism espoused by festival architects, practiced at the LCC, and promoted by the Architectural Review. In response, they turned their attention toward the work of canonically modern architects such as Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier, whose recent projects in steel and reinforced concrete (figs. 1.5, i.6) seemed to offer more suitable models for their own work.42 The Independent Group and the Birth of the New Brutalism Banham and his contemporaries found a similar taste for the conviction of Continental modernism at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), which had been founded in London in 1948 by the artists E. L.T. Mesens and Roland Penrose and the art historian Herbert Read.43 In contrast to the populist trends promoted by official government agencies, the ICA advocated an elitist form of modern art with close ties to Mesens\u2019s and Penrose\u2019s roots in surrealism and to Read\u2019s purist, Neoplatonic aesthetic theories.44 Though the ICA often received funding from the Arts Council and even staged an exhibition for the Festival of Britain, the institute operated largely outside the mainstream and quickly came to be seen as \u201cthe place to go for outrageous art.\u201d45 Artists and architects of Banham\u2019s circle gravitated to the institute soon after its acquisition of a permanent headquarters in 1950.46 In 1951, Richard Hamilton assembled the exhibition Growth and Form at the ICA to coincide with the eighth Congres internationaux d\u2019architecture moderne (CIAM) meeting, fig. 1.5 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (German, 1886 1969).

Who can say? All we know is what moves us now. This day. January 23,1954 s7 This short text appeared at a moment when the term New Brutalism, which for several years had circulated among younger London architects as a \u201cmildly sarcastic\u201d send up of the various other new \u201cisms\u201d they derided, began to take on a more serious air.58 From the start, the epithet was closely associated with the Smithsons, who adopted it as something of a personal battle cry that encapsulated their view of \u201carchitecture as a direct result of a way of life.\u201d59 As they described it in 1955, that way of life involved \u201ca sort of reverence for the natural world and, from that, for the materials of the built world.\u201d The latter, they claimed, would affect \u201ca realization of the affinity which can be established between building and man.\u201d60 Such relationships, they surmised, took on a deep resonance with human history: \u201cIn the Golden Age, the humblest swineherd between his doorposts was the image of humanity: deliberate, noble, and even elegant. The dream takes positive shape \u2014 a built domain where our everyday life will seem heroic.\u201d61 While the oft cited importance of material choices and no frills building construction should not be underestimated, it is important to underscore here the centrality of abstract, often classically inspired form to the Smithsons\u2019 early conception of the New Brutalism. In a 1953 text on their Hunstanton Secondary Modern School (figs. 1.9 1.11; see pi. 1), for example, they made their classical affiliations overt: \u201cPlastically it achieves its ends through finite, locked, symmetrical relationships, a complex on a raised podium whose ancestor is the Sunion [sic] Temenos.\u201d62 The following year, they implored their readers to notice an important duality in their understanding of the school: FIG. 1.10 Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003).

Hunstanton Secondary Modern School (Hunstanton, England, 1954). Interior view. IN SEARCH OF ALTERNATIVE? to exist as idea even when the Built Form has long disappeared. It is through BUILT FORM that the inherent nobility of man finds release.63 In the Smithsons\u2019 conception of the New Brutalism, quotidian function, though a part of a building\u2019s \u201ceveryday life,\u201d was transient. Abstract form, by contrast, would persist even in the absence of the noble materials from which Brutalist buildings had been constructed, and was, ultimately, the guarantor of nobility. In these early texts, the Smithsons\u2019 earnest solemnity with respect to abstract form is palpable. Read over half a century later, it is easy to miss that in the early 1950s, as Anthony Vidler pointed out, the movement also \"carried all the overtones of an elaborate fiction, a style hoax visited on the unsuspecting establishment of British left wing modernism.\u201d64 This sarcastic air, as well as the Smithsons\u2019 commitment to abstract form, has been obscured in recent scholarship, which tends to focus on the role of concrete materials, visceral images, and earnest rhetoric and to conflate the artistic ambitions of other Independent Group members with the architectural motivations of the Smithsons. In part, these tendencies stem from Banham\u2019s own famous 1955 essay on the New Brutalism, in which he introduced his complex notion of the \"image\u201d and named Parallel of Life and Art as \u201ca locus classics of the movement.\u201d65 Yet, as Dirk van den Heuvel has pointed out, \u201cthe foursome responsible for the installation never explicitly conceived of the exhibition as a manifestation of the New Brutalism as such.\u201d66 Indeed, while the influence of the young artists in their circle on the Smithsons is undeniable, the respective attitudes of the artists and architects toward the relevance of modern precedents to their own work were sharply divergent. As Banham explained in 1958, artists such as Paolozzi and Turnbull \u201cresolutely rejected that aesthetic of pure form... and the theory of the Thirties; the Brutalists have rejected only the forms, on the ground that they are false to the theory; and the theory they accept in its full moralistic, functional, and rationalistic rigour, as it has been accepted, more or less, by progressive architects for over a century now.\u201d67 The forms in question here were those \"rule and compass shapes\u201d of the \u201cwhite architecture of the Thirties,\u201d68 that is, of the International Style, whose compositional logic stemmed from exactly the classical sources that the Smithsons had held in high regard in the early 1950s. Banham, by contrast, saw such forms as impediments to technological progress, and they became important targets in his writing of the period. In \u201cThe New Brutalism,\u201d he crafted a delicate treatment of the movement that carefully isolated, neutered, and excised classical associations as it nudged the Smithsons away from conventional formalism and closer to the artistic ambitions of Flenderson, Paolozzi, and Turnbull. A key component of his argument was the Smithsons\u2019 apparent abandonment in the early 1950s of the \u201cformal\u201d and classically inspired planning of the Hunstanton School for the \u201caformal\u201d organization of their competition design for an extension to Sheffield University (see figs. 1.15, 1 20,1.21). This move, Banham surmised, represented a crucial break with conventional modern architecture and could be understood as a signal of the Smith sons\u2019 commitment to producing \u201cune Architecture Autre... which fully matches up to the threat and promise of Parallel of Life and Art.\u2019\u201969 Banham\u2019s Brutalism Nevertheless, in his 1955 text, Banham cited the Hunstanton School and the small house the Smithsons designed for themselves at Colville Place in Soho, London, in 1953, as \u201cthe points of architectural reference by which the New Brutalism in architecture may be defined.\u201d70 Curiously, Banham had little else to say about the Soho House. It is not mentioned again in his 1955 essay, and it is entirely left out of his 1966 book. Similarly, the project largely has been overlooked in the historical literature on the New Brutalism.71 This lack of attention presumably owes to the fact that the house was never built and that published drawings of it are limited to a spare collection of plans, sections, and elevations (fig. 1.12). Yet, with its brash combination of straightforward construction, sensible functionality, and often witty nods to classical convention, the Soho House serves as a telling encapsulation of the formal and historical tensions that would prove central to the New Brutalism and with which Banham would grapple throughout his career. Planned for an infill site that had been bombed during the war, the Soho House comprised four floors measuring fifteen by twenty feet that were joined by a compact stair. The uppermost and ground floors were left undivided but for the stair and were to accommodate living space and a studio, respectively. The remaining floors were divided equally by a single partition to define spaces for sleeping and cooking on the first floor and bathing and storage in the basement. According to the architects, this curious organization of program was determined not in deference to the prevailing conventions of the project\u2019s Georgian context but rather by a sober consideration of environmental conditions. \u201cThe air and sunlight of the attics in the daytime,\u201d they surmised, \u201csuggests that living quarters should be up top, with the bathroom in the cool dim basement.\u201d72 Entry from the street was located at the northeast corner, with a small garden accessed over a concrete bench that spanned the south facade and cleverly allowed natural light to enter the bathroom below.73 In anticipation of neighboring row houses to the east and west, uninterrupted brick bearing walls were planned to sandwich the interior spaces. Concrete lintels spanning between them capped large strips of windows (patio doors at the garden) at the north and south facades. The lintels would have been left exposed on the two visible facades and, along with a corresponding concrete beam at the center of the fig. 1.12 Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003). House at Colville Place (Soho, London, 1952). Plans, sections, elevations. space, on the interior. Wood floor joists and tongue and groove decking also would have been exposed, though the clinker brick of the central partition and surrounding the windows to the north and south was to have been plastered. At the upper level, the wooden roof would have sloped in from the party walls to a single gutter that bisected the space lengthwise and joined a cast iron drain pipe ceremoniously located at the center of the north facade. The overall effect is curious, at once strangely formal and casually ad hoc. On one hand, the patchwork of bare brick, plaster, wood, and concrete on the interiors, in concert with what undoubtedly would have been a spartan collection of furnishings, would have given the impression of an austere yet comfortable environment free of the anachronistic conceits of its Georgian neighbors. Exposed plumbing and electrical equipment would have added to the frankness of the endeavor. On the other hand, conspicuously clever details (such as the glass blocks at the base of the bench at the back of the studio) and the project\u2019s insistent symmetries, proportional rigor, and cheeky axial relationships appear to have been devised with a ARCH OF ALTERNATIVES mischievous wink in the direction of those who were paying attention. The axial comedy is best observed in the basement, where the toilet, lit from above by the south facing bench cum clerestory, is honorifically aligned with both the bathroom door and the prominently placed drain pipe centered on the opposite wall. Further pretensions, if less outright wit, were to be found in the dimensions governing the plan. The stair, for example, occupies a five foot square module of a grid that extends over the entire plan of the building. Its corner position subdivides the front room into two additional squares, one five by five feet and the other ten by ten feet.74 Each of the smaller rooms measures fifteen by ten feet and the larger ones twenty by fifteen feet. These proportions, 3:2 (musically, a perfect fifth) and 4:3 (a perfect fourth), were among those discussed by Rudolf Wittkower in his influential Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (1949), in which he described a preference among Renaissance architects for \u201can easily perceptible ratio between the length, height, and depth of a building.\u201d75 Alongside many in their generation, the Smithsons enthusiastically read Wittkower\u2019s book in the late 1940s and early \u201950s.76 Architectural Principles contributed not only to the increased interest in rigorously applied geometric and proportional systems by the Smithsons and their contemporaries but also, particularly as interpreted and built upon by Wittkower\u2019s student Colin Rowe, to bridging the gap between modern architecture and the historical past.77 Though most contemporary commentators (including Banham) focused on the discussions of abstract geometric matrices that formed the core of Architectural Principles, Wittkower devoted considerable attention in the book to \u201csocietal meaning\u201d and tightly linked form, function, and symbolism in his interpretations.78 These tendencies undoubtedly contributed to the book\u2019s influence on contemporary architects, who found in it an antidote to the prevailing tendencies of mainstream practice. As Peter Smithson put it, Wittkower\u2019s book had given his generation \u201csomething to believe in.\u201d79 Equally important to the reception of Architectural Principles, as Alina Payne has shown in a perceptive essay, was the book\u2019s echo of Sigfried Giedion\u2019s writings, particularly Space, Time, and Architecture (1941), in which he closely linked science with the arts and favored objectivity and rationalism over subjectivity and expressionism in modern architecture.80 This desire to link art and science was a common theme among the Independent Group and many postwar practitioners of the Smithsons\u2019 generation, and it was adopted with well known zeal by Banham, who would argue for a \u201cscientific aesthetic\u201d in his famous \u201cArchitecture after i960\u201d series in the Architectural Review.81 If Wittkower\u2019s book squared neatly with Giedion and the modernist establishment, it also diverged sharply from the status quo in Renaissance studies. Prominent earlier accounts of the period \u2014such as those of John Ruskin, Geoffrey Scott, and Heinrich Wolfflin \u2014 privileged Renaissance architecture\u2019s sensuous aspects and its emotional impact on human subjects, and they showed little connection between the arts and science.82 According to one reviewer, Wittkower\u2019s book fully eclipsed such interpretations and \u201cdispose[d], once and for all, of the hedonistic, or purely aesthetic, theory of Renaissance architecture.\u201d83 Taking specific aim at the sensuous humanism Scott advanced in his influential Architecture of Humanism of 1914, Wittkower proposed instead a humanism in which abstract geometries (primarily those inscribed in two dimensional plans and elevations) took precedence over sculpture and ornament84 If, for Scott, humanism had to do primarily with the body, for Wittkower, it had to do with the mind. This privileging of intellection over perception also put Wittkower at some remove from the visual bias of Nikolaus Pevsner and other editors of the Architectural Review, who had professed in a 1947 statement to be committed \u201cto re establish the supremacy of the eye.\u201d85 Like Wittkower\u2019s, the Review\u2019s position was bound up with the question of humanism, but their call for a \u201cnew humanism\u201d86 had less to do with Renaissance historiography than with an attempt to humanize contemporary architecture by intersecting it with the planning principles of the English picturesque tradition under the banner of Townscape. A key component of this process was \u201cthe recovery of ornament, color, texture, and a specific consciousness of history in relation to place.\u201d87 Often, these qualities were sought by drawing attention to the \u201csubmerged third\u201d of town planning, elements such as power lines, advertising, paving surfaces, and other everyday items deemed by the Review\u2019s editors to have been left out in the division of professional responsibilities that characterized modernist planning.88 As mentioned above, the younger generation hotly disputed the Review\u2019s promotion of Townscape through the early 1950s, and the Smithsons, who would later declare to have positioned their early work in direct contrast to the \u201cgoing literary style of the Architectural Review,\u201d89 soon also distanced themselves from Wittkower\u2019s thinking. In April 1957, they summed up the formal development of the New Brutalism as a search for a holistic approach to problems of human inhabitation that of necessity moved beyond Wittkower\u2019s abstract geometries: \u201cFrom individual buildings, disciplined on the whole by classical aesthetic techniques, we moved on to an examination of the whole problem of human associations and the relationship that building and community has to them. From this study has grown a completely new attitude and non classical aesthetic.\u201d90 Banham\u2019s skepticism of Wittkower inspired neoclassicism, as well as of the neo picturesque position of his employers at the Architectural Review, is well known. Yet, in his famous three part formulation of the New Brutalism\u2019s main characteristics as \u201c1, Memorability as an Image; 2, Clear exhibition of Structure; and 3, Valuation of Materials \u2018as found,\u2019\u201d91 one finds traces not only of Wittkower\u2019s intellectual humanism but also of the picturesque humanism of Pevsner and the Review and even of the earlier hedonistic humanism of Scott. Banham\u2019s valorization of as found materials, for example, calls to mind not only the rough concrete surfaces of Le Corbusier\u2019s Unite d\u2019Habitation and the unvarnished interiors of the Smithsons\u2019 Soho House but also the quotidian bric a brac of the \u201csubmerged third\u201d that drew the attention of the Architectural Review\u2019s editors. Advocates of Townscape and the New Brutalism alike shared a keen attentiveness to architectural surfaces, particularly to the textures and colors of common building materials, and architects associated with both camps exhibited a tendency to work with, as opposed to against, the limitations of existing conditions. Indeed, Banham\u2019s valorization of materials \u201cas found\u201d lies as close to the Smithsons\u2019 aim to \u201cdrag a rough poetry out of the confused and powerful forces which are at work\u201d92 in society as it does to the Review editors\u2019 desire, through the incorporation of everyday materials into new work, \u201cto invoke the messy vitality of the urban condition.\u201d93 Banham\u2019s requirement of \u201cClear exhibition of Structure,\u201d though obviously associated with visibly exposed structural assemblies in buildings, also had broader implications. As he clarified toward the end of his 1955 essay, \u201cstructure, in its fullest sense, is the relationship of parts\u201d in a building.94 With this expanded definition, Banham amplified an echo of Wittkower in his own formulation \u2014 both historians stressed the clear presentation of abstract organizational systems and integrated part to whole relationships that gave buildings their convincing sense of unity. Also like Wittkower, Banham sought in architecture a legible reflection of the contemporary moment and even linked his idea of \u201cMemorability as an Image\u201d to the centralized church of Santa Maria della Consolazione (begun 1508) in Todi, Italy, the first realized building illustrated in Architectural Principles.95 And though he noted that image making was \u201cconceptual,\u201d96 for Banham, memorability as an image had little to do with Wittkower\u2019s cool mathematical logic.97 As he put it in an oft quoted paraphrase of Thomas Aquinas in the 1955 essay, \u201cImage may be defined as quod visum perturbat\u2014that which seen, affects the emotions.\u201d98 In this, Banham aligned his concept not only with Le Corbusier\u2019s definition of architecture as \u201cthe use of raw materials to establish stirring emotions\u201d99 but also with the hedonistic humanism advocated by Scott and others. But where Scott\u2019s hedonism cleaved closely with the ancient pleasures of Vitruvian delight, the emotions that interested Banham were of a more forceful sort. Indeed, it was another quality of the Smithsons\u2019 work, its \u201cje m\u2019en foutisme, its bloodymindedness,\u201d that, for Banham, set the Smithsons apart from other fig. 1.13 Louis Kahn (American, b. Russia, 1901 74). Yale University Art Gallery (New Haven, Connecticut, 1953). View of gallery. Photo by Lionel Freedman. Philadelphia, Louis I. Kahn Collection, University of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. architects, such as Louis Kahn, whose 1953 Yale University Art Gallery (fig. 1.13) superficially aligned with New Brutalist visual qualities but fell short of the movement\u2019s aggressive stance due to \u201carty\u201d details and movable display screens that threatened the building\u2019s formal clarity.100 The Smithsons\u2019 frankly exposed structure, piping, and ductwork, however, delivered what Banham felt was a more unified and impactful coherence (see pi. 1). Just as importantly, the Smithsons\u2019 \u201cabstemious under designing of the details\u201d resulted in \u201cineloquence, but absolute consistency\u201d and carried the project\u2019s unvarnished conception through to all aspects of the visual field. For Banham, this ruthless consonance between concept and percept, planning and execution, and fact and appearance engendered an architectural object of singular, unmitigated coherence and formed the core of his concept of \u201cbuilding as \u2018an image.\u2019\u201d101 The term image held special significance in Banham\u2019s circles and has been much discussed in recent literature.102 The affective quality Banham described was clearly similar to the images Independent Group members found \u201cmoving\u201d\u2014such as the paintings of Jean Dubuffet and Jackson Pollock reproduced in Growth and Form and Parallel of Life and Art\u2014and sought to achieve in their own work. And though Banham suggested the term\u2019s \u201cspecial use\u201d at the time had been coined by Henderson,103 this specifically affective sense resonates with a range of other sources. As Alex Kitnick has pointed out, Banham\u2019s usage recalls the writings of Andre Breton, who claimed in his Manifeste du surrealisme (1924) that \u201cthe will is powerless... and no longer controls the faculties\u201d when faced with surrealist images.104 Anthony Vidler noticed a similar sense of the term in the writing of the art historian Ernst Gombrich, who in the 1950s was a lecturer at the Warburg Institute in London.105 In a widely read 1951 essay, Gombrich discussed images not in familiar terms having to do with the imitation of form but rather as visual stimuli that provoke specific reactions in a perceiving subject. Drawing on biological research into animal behavior, Gombrich hypothesized that a viewer\u2019s response to certain images had less to do with the recognition of a represented object than with more primal aspects of human perception. As he put it: \u201cWe know that there are certain privileged motifs in our world to which we respond almost too easily....Our automatic response is stronger than our visual awareness.\u201d106 Concurrent writings by the philosopher Susanne Langer also resonate with Banham\u2019s usage. For Banham, the possibility of architectural objects being understood as viscerally affective images was a crucial step toward the achievement of une architecture autre. Langer, too, closely linked the idea of an image with otherness. In her widely read 1953 text, Feeling and Form, she wrote: The work of art... if it is successful, detaches itself from the rest of the world. Every real work of art has a tendency to appear thus dissociated from its mundane environment. The most immediate impression it creates is one of \u201cotherness\u201d from reality\u2014the impression of an illusion enfolding the thing, action, statement, or flow of sound that constitutes the work. Even where the element of representation is absent, where nothing is imitated or feigned \u2014 in a lovely textile, a pot, a building, a sonata \u2014 this air of illusion, of being a sheer image, exists as forcibly as in the most deceptive picture or the most plausible narrative.107 For Langer, an object \u201cbecomes an image when it presents itself purely to our vision, i.e. as a sheer visual form instead of a locally and practically related object.\u201d108 Langer\u2019s notion of an artwork\u2019s striking alterity aligned closely with the effects Ban ham praised in the work of Alberto Burri, Magda Cordell, Henderson, Paolozzi, and Pollock that he used to illustrate \u201cThe New Brutalism\u201d (see fig. 1.8), while her description of an \u201cimpression of illusion\u201d predicted Banham\u2019s insistence that image making was \u201cconceptual.\u201d109 Despite these alignments, Banham made no mention of these sources in his 1955 essay nor in his 1966 book on the New Brutalism. Though unlikely, the possibility remains that he was unfamiliar with Langer\u2019s book at the time,110 but her absence, as well as that of Gombrich and surrealism, might better be attributed to fig. 1.14 Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003).

Gombrich was associated with Banham\u2019s formal education at the Courtauld, while surrealism, through Mesens and Penrose, was part of the legacy of the ICA leadership. And even if, as Mark Jarzombek noted, Langers writings were \u201ceagerly consumed by a young generation of artists, architects, and architectural theorists uncomfortable with the strictures of formalist analyses of the modernist style that had so dominated aesthetic discourses in the 1950s,\u201d111 Langer had also exerted a strong influence on Herbert Read\u2019s art criticism and, on those grounds, presumably was best left out of the discussion.112 In the end, the main target of Banham\u2019s argumentation was the classically inspired formalism to which all these sources were in some way linked. He stressed in his 1955 essay that the concept of the image was not beholden to the \u201cstandards of classical aesthetics,\u201d and even, in its affective influence on the emotions, \u201ccould subsume the pleasure caused by beauty.\u201d113 To bolster his case for an architecture conceived not so much against as beyond classical ideals, Banham invoked two unbuilt projects by the Smithsons that moved well away from conventional formalism. Their 1952 scheme for the Golden Lane Estate (fig. 1.14), he argued, was notable for its determination to create a coherent visual image by non formal means,\u201d while their proposal for Sheffield University (fig. 1.15; see also figs. 1.20,1.21) moved further into nonformalist territory, with an \u201cintuitive sense of topology\u201d replacing conventional architectural composition.114 At the outset of his essay, Banham had summarized the Hunstanton School\u2019s salient qualities as \u201c1, formal legibility of plan; 2, clear exhibition of structure; and 3, valuation of materials for their inherent quality \u2018as found.\u2019\u201d115 To underline the significance of the shift from formal planning to alternative organizational schemata, Banham concluded by revising his initial triad of principles and nominating a new project as the flagship example of New Brutalist architecture. Having demonstrated it to be extraneous to the New Brutalism\u2019s logic, Banham dropped \u201cformal legibility of plan\u201d from his list of core qualities, \u201cMemorability as an Image\u201d took its place alongside \u201cClear exhibition of Structure\u201d and \u201cValuation of Materials \u2018as found,'\u201d and the Sheffield University scheme, uncompromised by formal axiality, superseded the Hunstanton School as \u201cthe most extreme point reached by any Brutalists in their search for Une Architecture Autre.\u201d'1'16 Une Architecture Autre In contrast to his concise three part encapsulation of the New Brutalism, Ban ham\u2019s initial definition of une architecture autre was vague. In his 1955 essay, he relied primarily on analogies to the art world. In addition to Parallel of Life and Art, the French art critic Michel Tapie\u2019s 1952 book, Un art autre (in which Paolozzi appeared alongside other \u201canti artists\u201d such as Dubuffet and Pollock), provided a crucial source.117 In his 1966 book, Banham provided a more specific description. Une architecture autre, he claimed, \u201cwas intended to stand for something equally radical\u201d to Tapie\u2019s concept.118 It represented \u201can architecture whose vehemence fig. 1.15 Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003).

Unlike previous Smithsons projects that had employed conventional architectural materials, the House of the Future called for molded \u201cplastic impregnated fibrous plaster\u201d panels joined by synthetic gaskets.124 Individual programmatic volumes rose seamlessly from the plastic floor, took asymmetrical, somewhat expressionistic shapes, and were loosely arranged around a central ovoid courtyard. The house was outfitted with a full battery of modern technical gadgetry, including stereo, television, and short wave radio. At the exhibition, futuristically clad models (women in nylon dresses and tightly curled, frosted hair; men in snug wool leggings with integrated shoes) completed the scene. Banham saw alterity not only in the house's futurist \u201cstyling\u201d but also in its detailing, which the Smithsons developed from their study of American automobile design. Unlike British car manufacturers, which according to Banham accommodated accessories and components by \u201csticking them in as afterthoughts,\u201d American designers \u201cexhibited a dazzling command of details, joints, and connections.\u201d125 Likewise, the Smithsons offered a \u201ccomplete aesthetic of panels and joints\u201d and a convincing sense of unity that, because it issued primarily from its detailing, owed no allegiance to traditional architectural conventions. fig. 1.18 Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003).

J But even with these later works, the Sheffield University scheme remained the Smithsons\u2019 most promising postulation of an \u201cother\u201d architecture. In his 1955 essay, Banham described the scheme as one in which \u201caformalism becomes a positive force in its composition as it does in a painting by Burri or Pollock.\u201d126 Yet, this was a composition \u201cbased not on the elementary rule and compass geometry which underlies most architectural composition, so much as an intuitive sense of topology.\u201d127 As Banham used it here, topology stood for a sort of unity derived not from geometric integration of building forms but rather from the unifying connective tissue of circulation systems.128 Banham\u2019s use of topology, like his use of image, was closely related to his ambition to develop a discourse for architecture more in line with scientific culture than with traditional aesthetics, as Laurent Stalder described in a perceptive essay.129 The term, which Banham borrowed from D\u2019Arcy Thompson, gave his argumentation a quasi scientific air and underwrote a desire to move architecture away from \u201cunitary, simple, and elementary\u201d forms toward more open systems and a rigorous, analysis driven approach to the solution of architectural problems.130 In Stalder\u2019s reading, Banham saw topology as a method. Image, by contrast, was the expression of that method. Yet, as Banham admitted in his 1966 book, the Smithsons\u2019 arrangement of buildings at Sheffield gave the impression, at least superficially, of informal picturesque planning. But, he continued, \u201cwhereas Picturesque compositional techniques were normally used to build up images of rich and confusing abundance, the effect of the arrangement offered by the Smithsons appears in the drawing to be aloof, rebarba tive, and deliberately anti graceful, replacing the sweetness and sentimentality of the Picturesque with a blunt and uncompromising statement of structure and function in every part.\u201d131 Indeed, at Sheffield, expedient function appears to trump the niceties of picturesque planning. In the plan, the project snakes around the perimeter of the site to define a loose, pentagonal courtyard, its disparate ends linked to each other and to existing buildings on the site by linear catwalks (see fig. 1.21). In line with Banham\u2019s New Brutalist checklist, the Smithsons depicted a building in which materials (bare concrete and glass) were deployed \u201cas found\u201d and the structural system was frankly displayed. With its exterior expression derived entirely from the even rhythm of the concrete frame and glazing joints, the building\u2014particularly in a much reproduced axonometric drawing (see fig. 1.15) \u2014 exhibited an uncompromising and distinctly memorable image. An altogether different impression is given by the perspectival view Banham included with his 1955 essay (fig. 1.20). Here, a loose, asymmetrical group of building elements of varying heights reminds one less of the aggressive aformalism of Pollock than the crenellated silhouettes of the picturesque tradition. Though less apparent in the published images of the Sheffield scheme, further associations with that tradition \u2014 as well as with the neo picturesque of Townscape \u2014 stem from the planned juxtaposition of the Smithsons\u2019 addition to the existing Victorian buildings on the project site. While this might indicate the dictates of function taking precedence over the niceties of form, it seriously erodes Banham\u2019s insistence on a unified visual image. Had Sheffield been built, nearly any vantage point would have revealed not just the \u201cbloodyminded\u201d rigor of the Smithsons\u2019 concrete and glass fig. i.2i Alison Smithson (British, 1938 93) and Peter Smithson (British, 1923 2003). Sheffield University Extension (Sheffield, England, 1953). Site plan. intervention but also the intervention\u2019s complex compositional dialogue with surrounding buildings (fig. 1.21). The design proposed elevated concrete walkways and mechanical conduits that mercilessly skewer polite nineteenth century facades. To the east, the Smithsons\u2019 Brutalist perimeter focuses attention on the Victorian tail of the existing linear building. The older elevation assumes an honorific central position, while the new intervention offers a neutral backdrop. To the south, roles are reversed, as the Smithsons\u2019 Senate House forms a centralized modern pavilion within the existing building\u2019s Victorian perimeter. The visitor would be subjected to brash juxtapositions of Brutalist and Victorian elements everywhere, with careful formal relationships locking new and old into a dynamic composition. Far from visually unified, Sheffield\u2019s dissonant assemblage of elements achieves Banham\u2019s \u201cabsolute consistency\u201d as an image only when existing buildings, so carefully grafted into the Smithsons\u2019 proposal, are cropped out of view, as they are in both the perspective and the partial site plan that illustrate \u201cThe New Brutalism\u201d (see fig. 1.20).132 It is tempting to speculate that these views were chosen for publication precisely because they occlude the existing buildings at Sheffield, thus exaggerating the project\u2019s visual unity.133 Whether or not Banham was slanting the evidence to make his case, his commitment to ruthless visual consistency would soon come into conflict with his similarly vocal insistence on facile programmatic accommodation and drive him in later writing to develop an increasingly complex position with respect to dissonant architectural imagery. Accommodating Dissonance A trio of well known essays illustrate the point. Banham\u2019s famous two column analysis of the state of the discipline at the close of the 1950s, \u201ci960 \u2014 Stocktaking,\u201d appeared in a series of articles he assembled for the Review that addressed emerging technological opportunities for the field.134 Many of the themes Banham traced in \u201cThe New Brutalism\u201d are in evidence here, from attacks on Wittkowerian humanism and axial planning to a delicate treatment of the role of history in contemporary practice. Beyond the obvious tactic of composing the essay itself as a juxtaposition of two opposing viewpoints, Banham\u2019s short concluding section, \u201cThe Gap \u2014 Town Planning,\u201d warrants attention. Here, he argued that prevailing ideas concerning the city, like much of the \u201coperational lore\u201d he disparaged under the heading \u201cTradition,\u201d are debilitating presuppositions to be overcome. While he admitted that most people \u2014 designers as well as the broader public \u2014 assume that cities ought to be compact, each group also \u201cexpect[s] to be able to drive straight down an Autoroute de I\u2019Ouest, straight through the Arc de Triomphe, and into a Champs Elysees that still has the urbanity of a sequence from Gigi. They demand suburban expansiveness, and urban compactness, ancient monuments and tomorrow\u2019s mechanical aids simultaneously and in the same place.\u201d135 For Banham, the contradictory demands placed on the contemporary city called neither for a consistent expression nor for a ruthless adherence to a singular mode of organization, but rather for a dissonant accretion of multiple experiential possibilities and, by implication, their inevitable juxtaposition within the visual field. Banham soon extended his accretive vision to architectural practice in a 1961 address to the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Railing against the field\u2019s tendencies toward \u201carchitecture for architecture\u2019s sake,\u201d Banham insisted on the necessity of direct engagement with life. Again, he proposed the New Brutal ists as examples: \u201cIf Brutalists reached different and more radical judgments than other architects, it was not because of the cases with which they have asked to judge, but because the standards they have taken in passing judgment are different and, doubtless, more radical. And those standards have come from outside architecture, and what drives people mad about the Smithsons is that the standards are apt to be different from one building to the next.\u201d136 Here, six years after the publication of \u201cThe New Brutalism,\u201d consistency of approach, characterized now as the \u201cpure formalism of architects\u2019 architecture,\u201d137 has become a detriment; and an agile, ad hoc, and expedient incorporation of outside influences\u2014from science, technology, programmatic concerns, and elsewhere \u2014 signifies a progressive mode of operation. Notice the abrupt shift in Banham\u2019s argumentation. In 1955, he wrote, \u201cOne thing of which the Smithsons have never been accused is a lack of logic or consistency in thinking through a design.\u201d138 In 1961, one finds that the \u201cattempt to design by the light of a pure theory of architecture... has resulted in much of the most vacuous architecture we have.\u201d139 Consistency of approach now signified the \u201carchitects\u2019 architecture\u201d of an aloof and disconnected establishment, and it failed to deliver anything beyond \u201cempty expertise.\u201d140 By contrast, \u201cpositive manifestations of architecture gaining strength, or conviction, from its non architecture content\u201d were readily available to be pressed into service as counter proposals.141 Banham\u2019s indictment against the establishment was sweeping, and his remarks prompted this stinging reply from an audience member: \u201cDr. Banham has suggested that the human sciences are gathering momentum and that they should be our inspiration for the future.... While we are doing our best to use the human sciences will he not be standing by looking pontifical (rather like a younger G. K. Chesterton) and, when we have done our best and the buildings are complete, will he not come along and pass judgment on them in aesthetic terms?\u201d142 The criticism was valid, and Banham struggled, both in this talk and elsewhere, to strike a balance between an aesthetic agenda and the functionalist ethic he was advancing alongside. In his eyes, the New Brutalism offered a visual expression that did not fall into the nostalgic traps of \u201cthe So called New H, \u2022 pd tohear ^ those days about \u00b0f the earlV \u201950s, and the endless guff we u5 ^ ^Q[fi COncern for build' S f\u00b0r hUman scale\u2019etc etc\u201d143 By dem\u00b0nStra de the pPne in the proc ^ \u00b0CCUpants and incorporating expertise from oU ^g|1 ^ humane than ^ NeW Brutalists, in Banham\u2019s estimation, ha P c0mPr\u00b0 miSed the aesthetic ^ HUmaniStS\u2019 and> JU5t as importantly, they had n ^ But the Nb quality of their architecture in the process. urnber 0 f\u00b0rms and cou,dW| rUtaliSm\u2019S ViSUa' exPress'on was prone to take ^ aS t0 the visual H ^ ^ 6aSily t0 the relentless visual consistency 0 ^ tant t0 giving '^S\u00b0nance of Sheffield.

And, just as the prospeCt responsibility [for the design of cities] to the will of a dictator\u2014Le Corbusier at Chandigarh, Lucio Costa at Brasilia\u201d145 \u2014failed to deliver sufficiently flexible urban experiences, so too was an architect\u2019s tendency to design stylized built in containers around new technological elements such as televisions \u201clittle more than an attempt to impose a veneer of totalitarian order in a situation where something like democratic give and take may have been more to the point.\u201d146 Visual consistency was strained by the demands of experiential diversity (not to mention vilified by unsavory political associations), and the disciplinary status quo again was found ill equipped to deliver a solution. But all was not lost, and it was Le Corbusier himself who offered a way out: It is possible to abandon the position of autocratic dominance implicit in Bau haus theory without losing control of the over all design. Very small powers of accommodation enable the architect to do what Le Corbusier anticipated as long ago as 1925, that is, to exercise creative choice. His Pavilion de I\u2019Esprit Nouveau was entirely furnished with equipment from manufacturers catalogues, without the architect himself having to design a thing. Although the convincing unity of the total effect was doubtless helped by the fact that the rooms them selves had been designed in what he conceived to be the style of the objects that were to furnish them (and in this there is a lesson to be pondered), the whole operation was a triumph of disciplined and adventurous selection from what was at hand.147 As Sylvia Lavin noticed, Banham\u2019s recalibration of the architects responsibilities shifted focus away from the visual attributes of individual objects toward their inter active contributions to the overall affective milieu.148 And while this recalibration might have lessened \u201cthe architect\u2019s claim to be the absolute master of the visual environment,\u201d it was also a signal that \u201cthere may be more useful work done and better service rendered to the public.\u201d149 \u201cDesign by Choice\u201d stands as an important refinement of Banham\u2019s rhetoric in \u201cThe New Brutalism.\u201d With no direct link to a particular architectural practice or style, the concept was insulated from the aesthetic criticism that plagued the New Brutalism while remaining true to the three tenets he offered as its definition. The incorporation of manufactured objects \u201coff the peg, an idea that would gain cur rency in Banham\u2019s writings throughout the 1960s, was but a small step beyond using materials \u201cas found.\u201d The resistance to homogenizing architectural millwork used to conceal dissonant technological accoutrements was similarly a refinement of his 1955 call to clearly exhibit the structure, and it foreshadowed his later writings that would work aggressively to put mechanical services on par with structure as architect\u201d2 \u00b0b|eC'S \u00b0f archi,ecl|Jral expression.'50 Banham's final nVincin\u00ab 4 Sh0Uld be \u2014abie as an image, was rendered here as \" L ' '0,al effect\u201d a\"d \u2122\u00b0uld remain a crucial factor in his later \u00ab\"* j away frQS SUCh as these reveal a subtle shift in Banham\u2019s writing of1 \u00ae technology n l0glGS t0 contemP\u00b0rary art toward more direct links tecture ant f ^ a,S\u00b0 'ndicate an important decoupling of the cone P g^^lis^ had faded j\" 0\u00b0\u2122 *7 NeW Brutal'sm.

And if, by the mid 1960s, the Smithsons had failed to deliver on that promise, Fuller, Price, and a new generation of young architects experimenting with what Banham had christened a year earlier a \u201cclip on\u201d approach161 had already begun to exhibit signs of a more promising agenda.

Banham first used the phrase \u201cune architecture autre\u201d in \u201cThe New Brutalism,\u201d and the concept has received significant treatments by Nigel Whiteley and Anthony Vidier. See Nigel Whiteley, \u201cBanham and \u2018Otherness\u2019: Reyner Banham (1922 1988) and His Quest for an Architecture Autre,\u201d Architectural History 33 (1990): 188 221; Nigel Whiteley, Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002), 117 33; and Anthony Vidier, Histories of the Immediate Present: Inventing Architectural Modernism (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2008), 133 40. 6 Whiteley, \u201cBanham and \u2018Otherness,\u2019\u201d 219, emphasis in the original. 7 Vidier, Histories of the Immediate Present, 139. 8 Vidier, Histories of the Immediate Present, 134. 9 Vidler\u2019s chapter on Banham in Histories of the Immediate Present remains the strongest treatment of Banham s early career to date. Banham\u2019s own, slightly sarcastic version of events is also excellent.

The younger Hastings\u2019s role began as assistant editor in 1927, shifted to executive editor in 1935, and extended to his retirement in 1973. 29 See I. de Wolfe (pseudonym of Hugh de Cronin Hastings), \u201cTownscape: A Plea for an English Visual Philosophy Founded on the True Rock of Sir Uvedale Price,\u201d Architectural Review 106 (1949): 354 62.

They would have to use \u2018objects as found as the basis of their |^_ ture__Such fragments took on for them a magical quality, they beca objects, to be conspicuously displayed.7 To complete their formulation, the Smithsons borrowed a method for arrang these fragments from another American source, Charles and Ray Eames s recefi Y completed house in Pacific Palisades, California. There, the Smithsons discovers that \u201cobjects could be arranged, apparently casually, against a neutral background forceful resultant effect. The combination of the Mies aesthetic with the Earneses concept of arrangement proved electrifying when interpreted by the Smithsons. The wash handbasins and kitchen stoves at Hunstanton seen against walls of glsss convey still the strongest impression of the Brutalist image\u201d (see pi. 1).8 According to Middleton, as the Smithsons gained confidence in using this hybrid of Miesian aesthetics and Eamesian curation, they advanced more complex architectural proposals. Unsatisfied to simply collage elements into new combinations, they experimented with and quickly abandoned Palladian geometry before arriving at a more useful organizing logic in Louis Kahn\u2019s notion of \u201cthe link.\u201dy As Middleton described, \u201cThe link and the route soon became all important for the Smithson\u2019s [sic] concept of an organic architecture, in which individual homes or buildings were all slotted into the town as a whole.\u201d10 Middleton then recounted precedents (including Alvar Aalto\u2019s 1948 Baker House at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and early projects (such as Smith and Lynn\u2019s Park Hill Flats [see fig. 2.3]) that subscribed to this logic and led in a clear progression from Hunstanton to the Economist building. Contrasting Banham\u2019s disappointed assessment in The New Brutalism, Middleton argued that the Economist building demonstrated not the Smithsons\u2019 abdication of but rather their deep commitment to the ethical mission of the New Brutalism. Some of Middleton\u2019s arguments resonated with Banham\u2019s. But where Middle ton, like the Smithsons, was content to see new techniques and as found components distilled into polished solutions such as the Economist building, Banham remained committed to an alternative aesthetic to be coupled with alternative principles. A year prior to the release of The New Brutalism, Banham published \u201cA Clip On Architecture.\u201d Sidestepping Brutalism altogether, in the text he located clip on\u2019s roots in the emergence of \u201cendless and indeterminate\u201d projects, such as Eero Saarinen\u2019s General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan (1948 55) (fig 2.4), and in accompanying midcentury rhetoric. Gerhard Kallman\u2019s suggestion that traditional modes of centralized compositional unity were threatened with obsolescence by new techniques involving indeterminate extension was crucial: \u201cThe question of whether\u2014with emerging new realities of the anonymous, of endlessly linked chains, of fugal and progressional rhythms\u2014all centristic concepts, be they geometrical or irregular, will give way to new concepts, is now becoming a very burning one.\u201d11 Certainly an advocate of such noncentristic approaches, Banham noted that Kallman\u2019s query fell on deaf ears in America: \u201cSubsequent history shows that the fig. 2.4 Eero Saarinen (American, 1910 61).

The nonhierc ^ uncer approach enabled architects to be \u201ccautiously noncommittal a ^ ^ as Rich tainties of postwar reconstruction.\u201d13 Though some commentators, i Rohe\u2019s work at tnc ard Llewelyn Davies, associated the approach with Mies van ^ \\ associa~ Illinois Institute of Technology,14 Banham found that projects c assica tions too overt and offered instead anticlassical examples such as Such housing blocks near Paris and Lynn and Smith\u2019s Park Hill Flats (see g ^ nQt projects, Banham observed, represented \u201can architecture whose kal\" defined by the accepted rules of architecture \u2014 symmetry, unity, cohe ance, and all those.\u201d15 Instead, these projects were provided wit walk through the organization of circulation systems. Each featured pedest ways and bridges that linked the various housing blocks together in a mann ^ to the elevated circulation routes the Smithsons had used in their Golde Estate (see fig. 1.14). Rehearsing his arguments in The New Brutalism, Banham associated ^ aformal innovations with parallel developments in contemporary art, inclu ing nonhierarchical qualities of Jackson Pollock\u2019s paintings, which, he noted, had bee introduced to British architectural audiences by Philip Johnson in a 1951 lectu the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).16 These varied sources led Britis architects to seek \u201ca kind of building design which was not only endless, indeter minate, and a formal, but in which every bit was as good as another and could e replaced by any other.\u201d17 In Banham\u2019s view, they did not find such a method. Indeed, Banham did not see nonhierarchical interchangeability, as Middleton did, in the New Brutalism. Rather, in the Smithsons\u2019 urban schemes of the period and even in the Park Hill Flats, which, he admitted, came \u201cpretty close to \u2018an other archi tecture,\u201d\u201918 Banham saw a distinct \u201cre appearance of the Picturesque method, which precluded the possibility of the otherness he sought. Nevertheless, it was the Smithsons themselves who provided a seminal counterexample. The Smithsons\u2019 1956 House of the Future (see figs. 1.18,1.19) offered what Banham saw as a new approach to producing endlessness in architecture. Yet what set it apart from contemporary examples was not its seamless integration of technology but rather its clever aggregation of housing units. With its monolithic exterior interrupted by just a single door and interior light provided by the central open court (and ample artificial lighting), multiple houses could be arranged in side to side and back to back rows, producing an extendable urban system of repeated living units (fig. 2.5). Banham saw this innovation as crucial: Where Davies had identified repeating structural units that could be added up into a useable volume, the Smithsons were offering usable volumes that could be added up to something more complex. The concept was less intellectually pellucid, but emotionally more appealing\u2014it is difficult to identify oneself with a pair of vertical mull ions, an underwindow air conditioner, and an area of tinted glass, but easy to identify with a room you can stand up and walk around in.20 Such an arrangement bolstered Banham\u2019s argument against the formalism associated with traditional architectural humanism (by offering endlessness as an alternative to \u201ccentristic\u201d concepts) and simultaneously appealed to its audience by offering an architecture that, while unusual, remained open to empathetic engagement by human subjects.21 While the House of the Future was an anomaly that would not be revisited in the Smithsons' oeuvre, clip together plastic components were studied further by the Belgian architect Jacques Baudon, whose Clip On House (1959) joined prefabricated kitchens, baths, and bedrooms to an ambiguously constructed \u201cfreeform\u201d living space via repeatable sections of plastic corridor elements. Despite their innovative approach, Banham noted a severe limitation in these early clip together proposals: Services, communication, and other manifestations of interdependency will have to be consciously designed at the same time as the units themselves \u2014 the result of not doing so can be seen in the overhead jungle of wires and marginal slummery of so many American trailer camps. If the units are simply spread on the ground, then the circulation of men and vehicles among them will become a determinant of the layout\u2014as with the corridors of Baudon's house, or even with the way the Smithson houses stack with their doors outwards, thus fixing the lines of communication along the sides of the super blocks into which they aggregate. If the units are stacked vertically, then some form of external structure will be needed to take up their cumulative weight; and if any substantial number are to be serviced with water, air, gas, piped music or you name it, then those services are going to thicken up into some pretty impressive ducts and trunking in places.22 Notice here Banham\u2019s dismissal not only of the ad hoc accretion of mechanical servicing but also of circulation design as methods for coordinating the aggregated system. The repeated living blocks of the House of the Future as well as the end on end corridor elements of Baudon\u2019s Clip On House could produce only more or less orthogonal streets and hallways around which living spaces would be organized.,te vvi^1 resonal I The more units joined in this manner, the more the projec ^ easily can ^ j traditional axial organizations and familiar street grids.

Underlining the compositional themes with which he organized the essay, oft quoted final prognosis focused on the project\u2019s \u2018 formal lessons. A Plug In y must look like a Plug In City. If people are to enjoy manipulating this kind of adaptable mechanical environment (and if they don\u2019t enjoy it, we have gained nothing over previous environments) then they will have to be able to recognize its parts and func tion, so that they can understand what it is doing to them, and what they are doing to it.\u201d33 In this, technical legibility couples with active performance while emotional enjoyment amplifies conventional empathy.34 As Banham saw it, Archigram had turned the tables on the entire discussion: \u201cWe started with Kallman making cautious predictions about what technology might do to aesthetics, we finish with aesthetics offering to give technology its marching orders.\u201d35 In these fantastical urban proposals, the hierarchical stasis of modern classicism was replaced by the loose flexibility of a Pollock canvas. At the same time, architecture\u2019s time honored ideal subject, the geometrically stable Vitruvian Man, was rejected in favor of the fun seeking Homo Ludens. This new architectural subject was not the wellspring of geometric hierarchies and proportional certainties to be reflected in architectural form but rather a fickle and active occupant whose pursuit of a good time reigned supreme. The New Brutalism, from the start committed to disciplinary first principles, had in Banham\u2019s assessment begun its inexorable decline into classicism almost as soon as it began. The clip on approach swore no such allegiance to classical convention and, bolstered by the unlikely celebrity of the Archigram group and the impending construction of the Fun Palace, appeared in 1965 to have an extremely promising future. As is well known, very few \u201chighly mechanized future environments\u201d on the order of Plug In City came to pass, and the Fun Palace soon succumbed to the crushing bureaucracies of the English building and planning authorities.36 Nonetheless, a collection of small scale built works appeared in London through the second half of the 1960s that stayed true to the ambitions of clip on. Early built projects are notable for their pragmatic approach. Where a Plug In City would require significant capital investment as well as a wholesale reconsideration of existing building codes, construction techniques, leasing agreements, and lifestyle habits, these more modest proposals could capitalize on the delivery of increased functional efficacy from an economically priced and easily constructed add on element. The remainder of this chapter presents three of these projects in detail: Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership\u2019s Student Hostel Service Tower for the International Students Club (1967, commonly known as the Bathroom Tower), Richard + Su Rogers\u2019s Conversion and Roof Extension for the Design Research Unit (1969 71, the DRU Conversion), and James Stirling and Edward Cullinan\u2019s work at the Olivetti Training Center in Hasle mere (1969 74). Each comprised a renovation of and addition to an existing nineteenth century structure, and all three were designed with forms, materials, and programmatic elements in stark contrast to existing conditions. Though these early examples of High Tech architecture reflected exactly the tactics he had outlined in \u201cA Clip On Architecture,\u201d Banham had curiously little to say about them. He never published a word on the Bathroom Tower or the DRU Conversion, and, in his published comments on the Olivetti Training Center, he was surprisingly critical of his friend Stirling\u2019s work. His position on these projects ultimately proved consistent with his preference for visual coherence over dissonant juxtaposition, and his comments on Olivetti introduce a telling development in his thinking regarding human subjects, particularly the varying levels of attention afforded buildings by distracted inhabitants and attentive critics alike. The Bathroom Tower With the Bathroom Tower (figs. 2.8 2.10; see pi. 4), the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership converted six nineteenth century terrace houses in London\u2019s Paddington district into a dormitory facility for 190 mostly international university students. Beyond this, the clients requested that the buildings be \u201cunited\u201d both horizontally and vertically.37 While ample volume for sleeping, dining, and study spaces could be accommodated in the existing buildings, retrofitting these masonry structures with sufficient plumbing facilities was deemed too costly.

From \u201cConversion: The Farrell/ Grimshaw Partnership\u2019s Bathroom Tower,\u201d Architectural Design (October 1968) : 491. requirements of a necessary 3,600 gallon water tank exceeded the bearing capac ity of the existing masonry, and site access precluded the use of a crane for con struction. Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s solution offered a freestanding steel frame mast that was six feet across its hexagonal plan. The mast, located at the rear of the site, was crowned with a water tower and skewered communal recreational rooms and dining halls below. The mast, which carried a crane during construction, also supported thirty five prefabricated bathroom pods in glass reinforced polyester (GRP) These were hung outboard of the hexagonal superstructure and were accessed by a continuous helical ramp, also cantilevered from the central mast, which clev erly negotiated the varying floor to floor heights of the existing buildings. Students would enter the ramp from their respective floors, continuing up or down until they encountered a vacant cell. Translucent glass panels spanned vertically between the ramp\u2019s levels to provide enclosure. Within the existing town houses, central corri dors ran the length of the block, puncturing party walls to access a variety of room types. Double height lofts cleverly colonized the space above corridors on the first floor, while more perfunctory \u201cstudy bedrooms\u201d filled in the upper levels. In their solution, Farrell/Grimshaw drew heavily on the excitement over clip on architecture that swept through London student circles in the mid 1960s. Nicholas Grimshaw had come under the sway of Archigram member Peter Cook while studying at the Architectural Association School from 1962 to 1965. In 1966, his student work had even been featured in Archigram 6.38 The Bathroom Tower undeniably resonated with Archigram projects of the period, especially Warren Chalk\u2019s famous Capsule Homes Tower of 1964 (fig. 2.11). In Chalk\u2019s proposal, individual plastic elements could be plugged into a central structural and mechanical mast, while car parking was provided at the base of the tower on a helical ramp. The central mast supported a rooftop crane used to maneuver the prefabricated pods into and out of the matrix. Chalk\u2019s project owed much to earlier precedents. It bore more than a passing resemblance to Bertrand Goldberg\u2019s Marina City Towers in Chicago (1959 65), but it was Buckminster Fuller, who by the mid 1960s had achieved guru status among London\u2019s young architects, who provided the strongest inspiration. Fuller\u2019s rise to disciplinary notoriety came in the wake of commentaries by British authors.39 John McHale, an influential member of the Independent Group, published an important article in the Architectural Review in 1956, while Banham famously cast Fuller into a messianic role in the conclusion of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i96o).40 Fuller\u2019s work regularly turned up in the Archigram pamphlets,41 and it occasionally even appeared in Archigram projects, as evidenced in the accretion of geodesic domes in Peter Cook\u2019s Entertainments Tower for Expo \u201967 in Montreal (unbuilt, designed while Cook was employed at Taylor Woodrow Design Group, 1963) (see pi. 5). fig. 2.11 Warren Chalk (British, 1927 87). Capsule Homes Tower (1964). Elevation. FIG. 2.12 R. Buckminster Fuller (American, 1895 1983). 4D Tower (1929). Elevation. A comparison of early Fuller projects with later proposals by Archigram members and Farrell/Grimshaw demonstrates the depth of influence. Fuller\u2019s first publication, 4D Time Lock (1929), features a trove of salient precedents.42 The work s title project, the 4D Tower, a hexagonal structure supported on a central tower and capped by a crane, was to be delivered and installed by a zeppelin (fig. 2.12).43 Fuller elucidated the project in unorthodox drawings, including a six frame comic strip. It is a clear antecedent to Herron\u2019s Capsule Tower and Cook\u2019s later Instant City (1968), which was similarly to be delivered to the site by dirigible. While it is unlikely that Fuller\u2019s text would have been available to the Archigram group in the early 1960s,44 the comic strip was reproduced in Ulrich Conrads\u2019s influential Architecture of Fantasy (1962), as well as in the widely read Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller (1960), which featured a chapter length treatment of the project.45 Cook included the latter book in an \"infectious\u201d bibliography in his book Architecture: Action and Plan (1967).46 Centrally supported, hexagonal structures would also serve as the key device of Fuller\u2019s Dymaxion house studies (1927 45), in which he again exploited the structural efficiency of such configurations. Subdivided into equilateral triangles and warped over a sphere, the hexagon also features prominently in Fuller\u2019s most famous work, the geodesic dome.47 Further offering cues to later capsule projects, Fuller designed (and later patented) his famous self contained Dymaxion bathroom unit in 1937; and, in an apparently irresistible provocation to Farrell/Grimshaw, he illustrated an earlier \u201cunitary bathroom\u201d being hoisted into a hexagonally structured steel tower in 1927.48 The hexagonal form throws all of these works into a difficult relationship with calls for a renewed humanism pursued by various strains of midcentury modern architects.49 In the opening pages of Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism 0949), Rudolf Wittkower outlined Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s preference for centralized churches, and he illustrated the hexagon among a series of geometric constructions derived from circles that Alberti listed as suitable for church plans in De re aedifica toria (written ca. 1450, first printed i486).50 In Book IV of his treatise, Alberti noted that \u201cnature also delights in the hexagon. For bees, hornets, and insects of every kind have learned to build the cells of their hives entirely out of hexagons.\u201d51 Taken at face value, these passages threaten to open Fuller, Archigram, Farrell/Grimshaw, and other iconoclastic practices to alignment with classical paradigms and suggest yet another impending slide into neoclassicism. Yet Manfredo Tafuri suggested Alberti delivered his lines with a high degree of sarcasm and that they signaled his \u201caversion to Neo platonism [sic].\u201d Tafuri continued: \u201cThe tone he adopts when listing the orifices of animals as guide to the number of openings that a building should have leaves us with little doubt as to the pervasive irony of his intentions.\u201d52 In Tafuri\u2019s revisionist reading, even a humanist of Alberti\u2019s caliber approached ideal geometries with a degree of skepticism and indeed worked toward a \u201cdesacrilization of any possible transcendent principle.\u201d53 As Robin Middleton had described the Brutalists as working with \u201cwhatever fragments were available,\u201d54 Tafuri depicted an Alberti that operated through the expedient deployment of fragments within the urban milieu.55 For Tafuri, the efficacy of Alberti\u2019s humanism resided not in ideal architectural configurations (and certainly not in hexagonal, insect related ones56) or in \u201cinane forms of curiosity regarding first principles\u201d but rather in \u201caction\u201d and \u201cthe deeds of mortals.\u201d He concluded in an echo of New Brutalist rhetoric: \u201cArchitecture is, therefore, a manifestation of ethics.\u201d57 Regardless of the hexagon's level of humanist pedigree (or, for that matter, of Alberti\u2019s proto Brutalism), Fuller\u2019s unusual forms and pervasive disinterest in disciplinary convention were certainly factors in Philip Johnson\u2019s assertion that \u201cBucky Fuller was no architect,\u201d58 as well as in other midcentury architects\u2019 \u201cattitude of extreme hostility\u201d toward Fuller, which Banham noted in The New Brutalism.59 In his influential lecture, \u201cThe Seven Crutches of Architecture,\u201d Johnson paid homage to Fuller\u2019s legendary energy while rejecting his output: It\u2019s like a hurricane, you can\u2019t miss it if it\u2019s coming: he [Fuller] talks, you know, for five or six hours, and he ends up that all architecture is nonsense, and you have to build something like discontinuous domes. The arguments are beautiful. I have nothing against discontinuous domes, but for goodness sake, let\u2019s not call it architecture. Have you ever seen Bucky trying to put a door into one of his domed buildings? He\u2019s never succeeded, and wisely, when he does them, he doesn\u2019t put any covering over them, so they are magnificent pieces of pure sculpture. Sculpture also cannot result in architecture because architecture has problems that Bucky Fuller has not faced, like how do you get in and out.60 If Fuller\u2019s work did not resonate with the establishment, his influence over later generations was profound. The debt owed Fuller by young practitioners has been well documented, and the relationship between Fuller and his fans quickly became reciprocal. By the mid 1960s, the American inventor was speculating on large scale proposals with clear Archigram overtones, and he developed many ideas from the late 1960s onward in concert with Norman Foster, John McHale, and others 61 Of all these connections and sources, Fuller\u2019s modest Mechanical Wing (1940), which Banham presented as a seminal antecedent in \u201cA Clip On Architecture,\u201d warrants attention. The project \u2014 a small, self contained, trailer borne unit containing a bathroom, kitchen, and mechanical equipment that could be attached to an existing structure\u2014had been featured in the October 1940 issue of Architectural Forum, where, alongside a cutaway perspective view, it was sketched in combination with a tint, a small cottage, arvd a modem ?aincb home.. Vine eau% and Ctymax \"tm ^twAe\\,,ihese lWstffahom admd no reservations about dissonant compositional juxtapositions. An outboard motor for domestic enclosures, the Mechanical Wing offered enhanced mechanical performance with little regard for the aesthetic integration of a traditional architectural body into its technological prostheses. Farrell/Grimshaw s similarly pragmatic attitude with the Bathroom Tower sets their project apart from concurrent clip on experiments. Where the Fun Palace, Plug In City, the Capsule Homes Tower, and other Archigram projects offered the clip on sensibility as stand alone projects, Farrell/Grimshaw took the additional step of clipping their clip together unit to a conventional masonry structure. Not satisfied to leave this upgraded object \u201cas found,\u201d the architects aggressively transformed the internal spaces as well, stripping out elegant (though dilapidated) conventional rooms in pursuit of the expedient satisfaction of immediate programmatic necessity. Where the preexisting townhouses offered a familiar hierarchy of served and servant spaces, Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s renovation followed both Tafuri\u2019s Alberti and Johnsons Pollock,62 \u201cdesacrilizing\u201d a traditional diagram to elicit a series of spaces in which \u201cevery bit was as good as another and could be replaced by any other. Tall ceilinged parlors and cramped attics alike were converted into livable dormitory spaces, while neglected basement rooms and \u201cevery odd kink\u201d were elevated to the role of communal gathering space.64 With a shared technological apparatus appended to this matrix and accessible at all levels, individual living functions were disengaged from their conventional spatial containers to be distributed evenly across an energized, expedient, and indeterminate architectural milieu. Yet, for all this, Banham had no comment on the project. The omission is curious, in terms of the project\u2019s close resonance with his own interests at the time as well as his prolific output as a critic. Part of the reason may be personal \u2014 Banham rarely mentioned Farrell or Grimshaw in his writings, and when he did, he tended to adopt a negative tone. But the omission likely had more to do with compositional concerns. Like the Smithsons\u2019 Sheffield proposal, the Bathroom Tower was locked in close compositional dialogue with an existing Victorian structure. Despite Ban ham\u2019s allegiance to clip on expediency in theory, his silence here points again to his aversion to its compositional implications in practice. The DRU Extension Banham\u2019s similar silence with respect to Richard + Su Rogers\u2019s DRU Conversion (figs. 2.13, 2.14; see pi. 6) reinforces the point. The project came at a difficult time for the Rogerses, who had recently dissolved Team 4, their earlier partnership with Norman and Wendy Foster.65 After the split, the two formed their own practice, initially as an independent subsidiary of the Design Research Unit. The DRU had been conceived in 1942 as a multidisciplinary design consultancy by Marcus Brum well, Su Rogers\u2019s stepfather, in consultation with Herbert Read, and it began operating the following year.66 Though it had enjoyed a high degree of success in the postwar period,67 by the late 1960s, the firm seemed to Misha Black, its managing architect, to be somewhat behind the curve of contemporary British design. Black felt the Rogerses\u2019 presence might improve the firm\u2019s overall working atmosphere.68 Their first commission was a study in which the young architects were highly critical of the aging institution\u2019s organization and methods. Despite this alienating report, the Rogerses were commissioned to design the new DRU offices in London in 1969, with their fledgling practice taking up residence in a rooftop extension of their own design in 1971. In designing the interior fit out for the DRU\u2019s new office space, the Rogerses struggled to replace the cellular plan of the firm\u2019s previous offices with an open, flexible system better attuned to the indeterminate nature of the practice. As in Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s dormitory conversion, traditional interiors were rejected in favor of open, nonhierarchical arrangements. Conceiving every occupant \u201cas good as any other\u201d (at least in spatial terms), all office employees regardless of rank were allotted a similar amount of workspace within the open milieu.69 The Rogerses outfitted these new floor plans with vibrantly colored mobile furniture of their own design. Framed with off the shelf metal sections supporting plastic laminate work surfaces, the furniture pieces were seen by one commentator to \u201cassault or delight the visitor depending on his or her ability to gulp down colour by the gallon.\u201d70 The 1971 rooftop extension drew on earlier research the architects had conducted into prefabricated clip together constructions for their Zip Up Enclosure fig. 2.13 Richard + Su Rogers (Richard Rogers, British, b.

Photo by Eamonn O\u2019Mahony No. 1 of 1969 (fig. 2.15). The Architectural Review was quick to point out that project\u2019s affiliations with Fuller: \u201cRichard and Su Rogers, following in the footsteps of master Bucky with his attempt to use aeroplane technology for his Dymaxion house, are experimenting with a nouvelle vague technology of highly insulated lightweight panels and neoprene gasketry.\u201d71 The house took its name from the neoprene gaskets employed to zip together the prefabricated structural sandwich panels from which the house was constructed. The panels \u2014 aluminum skins over an insulating PVC core \u2014 formed rectangular \u201crings\u201d that merged walls, floors, and ceilings into a single continuous loop. Intended to be available for purchase at local stores, the rings were zipped together end to end to enclose an indeterminate space of any length. End elevations were to be fully glazed, while openings in the rings were cut at the discretion of the owner. As individual needs changed over time, additional rings easily could be added to the system, and non load bearing interior partitions and even plumbing locations could be adjusted as desired.72 The project was supported on a grid of adjustable steel jacks able to negotiate variable terrain and enabling easy relocation to other sites if the need or opportunity should arise. While the Zip Up concept had been met with significant resistance as a standalone proposal in a variety of sites,73 the specific constraints of a nineteenth century rooftop were well suited to the Rogerses\u2019 unconventional system. The DRU had secured planning approval for an additional floor to be added to the existing four story structure when the firm took ownership in 1969, but when the extension design was undertaken in 1971, it was discovered that the existing foundations could not support an additional story of conventional masonry.74 The Rogerses\u2019 lightweight Zip Up system was a perfect match. From the start, the Rogers office, now expanded to include architects Jan Kaplicky and Renzo Piano, intended a bold juxtaposition of old and new. Kaplicky\u2019s tongue in cheek photo collage of the brick warehouse capped by an oversize Volkswagen Beetle \u2014the car rendered in bright green and plugged into the existing roof by what appears to be a pneumatic hose\u2014set the tone (see pi. 6). The firm\u2019s original scheme brashly proposed an external truss frame to span twenty seven meters longitudinally between the building\u2019s party walls. Arched sandwich panels, this time with skins of GRP over a phenolic resin core, were to be affixed to the existing front and back facades and suspended from the truss frame, with a longitudinal skylight running the length of the scheme. Adding to the dissonance between old and new systems, the Rogerses designed the three by nine meter panels to be cranked askew of the existing building\u2019s orthogonal grid.75 In keeping with the Zip Up concept, the new office floor was raised off the existing roof on adjustable jacks, while electronics, computer equipment, and HVAC took their places in the plenum created between new floor and existing roof. The scheme\u2019s bright yellow finish was carried through the existing facade at new window heads and door panels in the openings below. Like previous Zip Up schemes, the proposal was not approved by London planning officials. The revisions the project went through to achieve approval unfolded from Kaplicky\u2019s original image to the final built work in a clear trajectory of domestication, as dissonant juxtaposition gave way to clear, if slightly begrudged, conformance. The final scheme dispensed with the external truss frame and proposed a series of three meter wide sandwich panels. In lieu of the GRP cladding rejected by the Greater London Council, the Rogerses offered an aluminum skin. The panels were supported internally on aluminum arched portals that spanned twelve meters orthogonally from front to back. An intermediate scheme showed seven equal bays in the extension, causing a disjunction with the rhythm of the existing facade\u2019s nine structural bays below (see fig. 2.13). In the final, realized scheme, nine aluminum bays march in lockstep with the existing masonry frame. The seven bay scheme boasted asymmetrical windows, a cylindrical water tank to the north, industrial access ladders with exaggerated railings wrapping from front to back, and frankly exposed leveling jacks perched on an existing cornice. The constructed scheme offers unabashed symmetry in panels and fenestration, while a continuous ribbon of steel (mounted to support window washing equipment) screens the previously exposed leveling jacks and reinforces the existing cornice line with a deep shadow (see fig. 2.14). Roof access via spiral stair, the industrial railings, and the water tank also were eliminated, leaving behind a minimal access ladder at the south end as the lone asymmetrical feature. fig. 2.16 James Stirling (British, 1926 92) with Edward Cullinan (British, b. 1931).

From Reyner Banham, \u201cProblem * 3 = Olivetti,\u201d Architectural Review 155 0974): 192. The Olivetti Training Center Working in a highly visible site in central London, the young Rogers office struggled with a conservative planning commission and a client steeped in the conventions of postwar modern architecture. In suburban Haslemere, James Stirling\u2019s far more established firm enjoyed a secluded site and a progressive client eager to embrace innovative design ideas for the Olivetti Training Center (see figs. 2.16 2.23, pis. 7, 8). Nine years Richard Rogers\u2019s senior, Stirling was a celebrated personality in the British architectural scene, having made a resounding entrance with his famous Leicester University Engineering Building (with James Gowan, 1959 63) and the Cambridge History Faculty Building (1964 67). Like the Rogerses and Farrell/Grimshaw, Stirling was charged with the expansion of an existing structure. In this case, Branksome Hilders (1900 1905), an Edwardian country estate by E.J. May, was to be transformed into a training facility for the growing Italian industrial design powerhouse. And like the Rogerses, Stirling offered a dissonant counterpoint to the existing vernacular in brightly colored GRP. But where the younger architects found themselves tracing a series of domesticating revisions that ultimately diluted the radicalism of their initial studies, Stirling, with a carefully choreographed assemblage of disparate elements and discordant spaces, advanced the dissonant qualities of the clip on approach to unprecedented heights. The project entailed the conversion of the existing house (which previously had functioned as a secondary school) to accommodate approximately one hundred trainee residents and the addition of a new wing for training rooms and meeting spaces (fig. 2.16). Stirling enlisted Edward Cullinan, a talented London architect five years his junior, to design the renovation, freeing himself to concentrate on a new structure to accommodate the education facilities. Though both architects contributed greatly to the final product, credit routinely goes to Stirling alone, despite Banham\u2019s efforts to correct prevailing lopsided attributions.76 Indeed, Banham\u2019s presentation in the Architectural Review remains the only published documentation of Cullinan\u2019s contribution (see figs. 2.17, 2.18, pi. 7). Cullinan inherited a rambling, vaguely U shaped plan set upon a high ridge, its central service court open to the north. The western arm of the U stretched north of its eastern counterpart and cranked to the west; a front door with gabled porch occupied the joint in the dogleg. The cranked portion of the house conformed to an orthogonal arrangement of outbuildings to the west. Three gabled bay windows at the southern facade faced a broad meadow and swimming pool beyond. At the eastern wing of the house, a loosely cruciform annex building extended the eastern wing\u2019s axis roughly parallel to a steep drop into the adjacent woods (fig. 2.17). Cullinan\u2019s intervention kept much of the existing construction intact, but, as Farrell/Grimshaw had done at the International Students Club, he bore little sentimentality for the previous organization. Rather than attempt to correct existing anomalies, Cullinan added a collection of dissonant elements to the mix. A glazed steel canopy was inserted to connect the annex with the existing building, the space between them becoming the link with Stirling\u2019s new structure to the east. The glazed element became the new entry to the complex, with the existing annex and cranked wing appearing to focus attention on the entry. Exterior stairs and ramps were added throughout to join the ground plane directly to new residential quarters above, a move that undercut the hierarchical formality of the existing building with an array of expedient and informal connections (fig. 2.18). The canopy opens onto a double height hall occupying the former service yard (see pi. 7). Open stairs link the ground floor common areas to a dense collection of dormitory rooms jigsawed into the irregular plan above. Cullinan\u2019s white steel rails and ad hoc stairs, ramps, and gangways gave his intervention a distinctly nautical air in stark contrast to the polite eccentricities of May\u2019s existing brick and shingle manse. As Banham noted, the architect justified the approach with deadpan rationality: \u201cCullinan himself explains it in terms of the need to find a mode of design that could bridge the gap between his (and his office\u2019s) own attitudes and those expressed by the house, and the only real point of fig. 2.18 Edward Cullinan (British, b 1931).

As Banham pointed out, Olivetti\u2019s program required \u201cradical reworking\u201d of the existing building to pro vide additional fire exits, mechanical services, and other infrastructural updates. Cullinan\u2019s approach enabled a particularly cost effective design. Aside from the removal of several unnecessary chimneys and external buttresses, the archi tect left the majority of May\u2019s work intact, casting the existing house as host for a set of delicate prostheses. Through the shingled roofs, Cullinan punched gabled dormers to bring light into new attic level study bedrooms. These dissonant elements\u2014 framed in white steel and constructed entirely of glass mimic forms appropriate to May\u2019s original but are rendered in materials that have no place in the otherwise nineteenth century vocabulary. Easily mistaken for original by approaching visitors (and viewers of published photographs), these subtle clues are the only indication from the south and west that something out of the ordinary is afoot. Cullinan\u2019s most transformative intervention inhabits the interstitial space of the former service court. The bright lobby was articulated with lightweight steel connectors in an abstract composition that linked the dormitory rooms above to one another and to the common spaces below (see pi. 7). The geometries and colors recall at once constructivist sources, industrial scaffolds, and children\u2019s toys. While Cullinan largely restricted his elemental exuberance to the new stair hall, he affected a significant transformation of the entire structure. Within this new enclosure, Cullinan supplied necessary plumbing, electrical, and HVAC without expensive manipulation of the existing building. A new basement below provided space for mechanical services for both the original house and Stirling's addition. Thus, Cullinan\u2019s central hall offered an expedient solution to the infrastructural and circulatory problems and provided a concentrated source from which both necessary environmental services and a contemporary sensibility emanated. Ban ham\u2019s assessment is noteworthy: \u201cThe result is not in any sense an unified style; it is a converter\u2019s idiom, which exists in its pure form in the center of the plan, and dilutes itself as it spreads outward and penetrates the older building.\u201d78 Working with \u201cwhatever fragments were available,\u201d79 Cullinan marshaled the scattered picturesque elements of May\u2019s scheme into a new, complex coherence. Stirling\u2019s contribution exhibits a similar blend of deadpan efficiency and brash dissonance (see figs. 2.19 2.23, pi. 8). The bulk of the scheme comprises double loaded classroom wings clad in GRP that extend roughly parallel to the east facade of the existing house. With rounded rectangular windows and gasketed connections between the GRP bays, the project bears more than a passing resemblance to the Rogerses\u2019 Zip Up prototypes, though, here, the younger architect\u2019s svelte rectangular section was stretched vertically along its central axis to suggest a gable. Countering the upward thrust of the roof slopes, depressed ridges punctured with a row of circular skylights run the length of the wings. The rounded corners, alternating colors, bucolic site, and clearly secondary status with respect to the original house all conspire to make the project resemble an inflatable tent for a garden party, its internal pressure somewhere short of snapping the ridge into its full upright position (fig. 2.19). In his characteristic style, Stirling explained his formal complexities as the result of no nonsense efficiency. To \u201cavoid colliding with groups of very large specimen trees\u201d and to occupy \u201clevel ground to permit linear expansion\u201d along the top of the ridge, the classroom wings were cranked inward toward the house.80 Though the building has not been extended since completion, the ambition to produce the possibility of repeatable elements distinctly aligns the work with the \u201cendless and indeterminate\u201d projects Banham examined in \u201cA Clip On Architecture.\u201d The idiosyncratic central area, however, gives rise to contrasting readings of insistent specificity. The plan renders the scheme an asymmetrically broken bar\u2014its two ends nudged inward to cradle the existing house while the glass membrane provides visual access to the splintered middle section.81 Here, the GRP bars were tethered to the renovated facility by a glass link containing skewed ramps negotiating both the slope of the site and the geometries of the glass enclosure. Adding further complexity to the scene, a square \u201cmultispace\u201d was planted resolutely within FIG. 2.19 James Stirling (British, 1926 92). Olivetti Training Center (Haslemere, England, 1969 74). Axonometric. fig. 2.20 James Stirling (British, 1926 92). Olivetti Training Center (Haslemere, England, 1969 74) Floor plans. this central zone (fig. 2.20). Crowned with a protruding cruciform roof, this elem rests unperturbed by the adjacent formal commotion. The project\u2019s spatial and elemental complexity is manifest most forcefully the glazed central zone (fig. 2.21). The multispace was set orthogonal to the main house, as was the southern edge of the glazed link. The northern edge of the link adheres to the grid of the north teaching wing, resulting in a splayed triangular space that Stirling capped with a glass gambrel roof and tipped toward the exist ing building to produce a spatial funnel back toward the entry. Two ramps connect the upper and lower floors of the addition to Cullinan\u2019s new entry. The southern ramp accesses the upper level and aligns with the orthogonal south wall, while the northern ramp splays roughly eleven degrees to split the angle between the southern ramp and the north wall. This directs the visitor\u2019s view not out the glazed eastern wall to the woods beyond, nor directly at the blank interior face of the classroom wall but instead, curiously, at an interior corner. The obvious visual conclusion of the woods is neither fully acknowledged nor denied; rather, one\u2019s view is deflected off an interior angle, and the climax is left jarringly unresolved (see pi. 8). Choosing the upper ramp similarly frustrates the viewer\u2019s visual access to the woods, as the ramp aligns on one of two double height, brightly colored radiator grills positioned in front of the glass wall to the east. From the ramps, space spills into the multispace, eddies into the classroom corridors, and unceremoniously leaks past a spiral staircase into the adjacent woods through the glazing beyond. Complex mechanical apparatuses further add to the complexity. The multispace can be subdivided into smaller areas by lowering wall partitions (and a stabilizing central column) from a cruciform protrusion in the roof. Full enclosure can be achieved by deploying retractable walls that scroll away into the northeast and southwest corners. Doing so results not only in the various room configurations Stirling\u2019s office carefully studied in their trademark axonometric drawings but also in a disturbing leftover gulley between the base of the access stairs and the flexible wall. This odd space leaves the remaining area of the link abruptly cropped, and it cleverly reiterates a similarly discomforting confrontation between the lawn\u2019s downward slope and the encroaching vertical wall in the space between the teaching wings and the existing house. The space is peppered with additional mechanical elements: Two story radiators frame the view to the woods to the east (off center to the roof overhead but symmetrical within the wall glazing) and, to the west, march in step with the structure of the glazed link. Air supply and return ducts punctuate interior surfaces as exaggerated nozzles and grommets. Two bulbous mushroom columns at the corner of the multispace suggest pistons lifting the upper floor slab, while a spiral stair just beyond recalls a spring under compressive load. These elements reinforce a diagonal axis across the multispace, with a corner stage, the paired columns, and the spiral stair all carefully aligned, befuddlingly, on fig. 2.21 James Stirling (British, 1926 92). Olivetti Training Center (Haslemere, England, 1969 74). Interior perspective of multispace and glazed link. the southernmost corner of the north teaching wing. Literally crowning this bizarre scene, a mechanized window cleaning apparatus, featuring a clever double hinged mechanism to negotiate the telescoping geometry of the link, periodically lumbers across the glass roof above. In a perceptive formal analysis, Joseph Rykwert further enumerated the project\u2019s discordant effects and linked them to previous Stirling efforts. A spiral staircase to focus an unresolved climax has been used by Stirling elsewhere, most conspicu^ ously at Leicester. The gawky effect is of course part of the mannerist intention. Deploying exuberant metaphorical rhetoric, Charles Jencks highlighted the varied references embedded in the project. He likened the plastic wings to railroad cars or Greyhound buses\u201d and even \u201cstacked waste bins\u201d before describing the central space as a promiscuous mash up of historical sources: \u201cThe Spada Gallery of Bor romini with scissor ramp of Le Corbusier and glazing by Paxton \u2014a kind of green house ship\u2019s deck where grey flannel technicians can meet quietly and converse. While accumulating these metaphors was his primary concern in the text, enc s perceptively outlined the project\u2019s clear inheritance of the historical t j ory being traced in the present book: The plan is similar to the informal topological planning of the Brutalist movement for which growth was a primary consideration. But beyond this is Stirling s partic ular brandmark, a quality (that can be found in all his buildings) of dynamic dis sonance. A comparable feeling in music would be the suspensions and tensions of Stravinsky; in painting, the distortions of Francis Bacon. The effect is tense, elastic, and frightening. Perhaps also it communicates the moral commitment of functionalism: a stern asceticism and a preference for truth over beauty. Here, Jencks tightly linked the dissonant assemblages of the clip on approach to the legacy of Brutalism. In adhering to a moral stance of \u201ctruth over beauty, tiring sacrificed \u201celegance\u201d in favor of \u201ca toughness and uncompromising qua ity. while Stirling\u2019s (and Cullinan\u2019s) deadpan rhetoric and efficiently attache cp on prosthetics might signify a \u201cmoral commitment of functionalism,\u201d their misc,evous relish in the aggressive (and functionally unnecessary) subversion <af tra itional formal and programmatic configurations belies any \u201cstern asceticism, he unconventional techniques evidenced at Haslemere move well beyond funct.ona propriety or clip on expediency. They mark a sustained effort to wittily undermine (or in Tafuri\u2019s term, to \u201cdesacrilize\u201d) established conventions in order to meditate on alternative forms of architectural coherence Strangely, Stirling\u2019s efforts drew a cool assessment from Banharr, lr contrast to the brash alterity suggested by Rykwert and Jencks, Banham found m Ha restrained, almost conventional contribution to the lineage of plastic shell construction. Turning his attention to the interior, he complained of questionable acoustics and inadequate environmental control in the teaching rooms and dismissed the central multispace and glazed link as \u201ccuriously under organized\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d He was similarly unimpressed by the proliferation (and performance) of mechanical gadgets, and he struggled with Stirling\u2019s unconventional tactics for achieving coherence within the complex. In describing the central space, he noticed that what holds it together are not the surfaces that bound the space, but the things in it \u2014 the mushroom columns, the enormous vertical radiators, the elaborately sculptured staircase, and the powerful colors. In strong sunlight, when external objects are seen through the glass, the effect of all this is liberating, if disorienting, so that there can be a faint feeling of insecurity as one perambulates the sloping surfaces of the ramps (a domestic version of the perilous spaces of the Eiffel Tower), but when it is dark outside and most of the light comes from the link\u2019s own internal sources, the whole scene goes out of focus somehow. He found a more convincing coherence on the exterior, where a view from the south between Stirling\u2019s wing and May\u2019s original \u201cgalvanizes the whole plastic panel system into architectural life\u201d (fig. 2.22). This, he argued, \u201cis perhaps the most telling view of the whole ensemble; the multispace sitting as mute and as smug as an fig. 2.22 James Stirling (British, 1926 92).

Indeed, Banham here seems the verge of full apostasy of his iconoclastic position. Coupling his quest to elu the \u201ccenter of the Center\u201d and his implied desire for elegant detailing, he appea L.l to embrace exactly those classical conventions of symmetry, unity, co erence, ance, and all those\u201d he had lampooned in \u201cA Clip On Architecture. Given the trajectory of Banham\u2019s writings, one might have expected him to praise Stirling\u2019s clunky detail as an admirably unvarnished solution chosen from well known sources \u2014 something akin to the \u201cabstemiously under designed details he had praised at the Hunstanton School.97 In its awkward expedience, the per functory seam underlines the dissonant themes so perceptively noted by Jencks and Rykwert and so consistently championed by Banham throughout the i95os an<^ \u201960s. Yet in these early writings, Banham repeatedly backpedaled in the face of visu ally dissonant architectural compositions. From his advocacy of the Smithsons in \u201cThe New Brutalism\u201d to his choice of Cook\u2019s Plug In City as the high point of A Clip On Architecture,\u201d Banham consistently favored visually integrated architectures as illustrations of the otherness he sought. Faced with Stirling\u2019s and Cullinan\u2019s brashly incongruous elements, Banham took a surprising tack. True to his impatience with disorderly objects, he found Stirlings spaces at Haslemere \u201cunder organized,\u201d his mechanical contraptions \u201cponderous,\u201d and his detailing brutish. He barely concerned himself with the formal intricacies that so perplexed Rykwert and Jencks and appealed instead to a traditional notion of centrality. Notice that his clue to the holistic centeredness of the Training Center was found when he initially failed to notice an architectural detail, at the point where mismatched glazing elements disappear into the reflective twinkle of adjacent glass planes. Unmolested by tectonic assemblies demanding scrutiny, the visitor glides happily past this irrelevant deficiency and on through the facility. At Olivetti, Banham exchanged the connoisseur\u2019s rapt attention for the distracted immersion of the flaneur, advancing exactly the shift in subjectivity suggested earlier in the replacement of the Vitruvian Man with Homo Ludens at the Fun Palace. Though the Olivetti complex was densely populated with playful architecture devices that offered sufficient diversion to entertain less aggressive critics, for Banham, Olivetti's \u201cfestive mood\u201d was produced neither through conventional ornamentation (Inigo Jones\u2019s lively swags at the Banqueting House) nor through look at me compositional devices (Stirling\u2019s rooftop robots, giant radiators, clumsy details, and frustrated axes). Indeed, such elements\u2014and the scrutiny they demand \u2014keep the subject object relation of traditional architecture firmly intact. While \u201cStirlingologists\u201d and other initiates into what Banham would later refer to as \u201cthe arcane and privileged aesthetic code\u201d98 of the discipline might enjoy the witty subversions deployed throughout the space, such pleasures, and the subjectivities they sanction, remain, like the New Brutalism, firmly within the realm of Le Corbusier\u2019s Vers une architecture (1923). In the end, Stirling and Cullinan\u2019s clip on conversion exceeded Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s functional iconoclasm at the Bathroom Tower while avoiding the Rogerses\u2019 capitulation to convention at the DRU Conversion. In doing so, Olivetti advanced bold new forms of compositional coherence to stand as an unparalleled achievement in the clip on idiom. But such compositional advances were of little interest to Banham. For him, it was in the work\u2019s contributions beyond the visual register\u2014its suggestion of a subjectivity unencumbered by the visual strictures of conventional formalism and its provocation of alternative modes of immersive experience \u2014that marked Olivetti\u2019s most productive swerve toward an \"other\u201d architecture.

Mary Banham (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996), 297. In the late 1960s, Reyner Banham produced some of his most polemical essays and perhaps his most radical book, The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment O969).1 In these texts, one finds not just an interrogation of key canonical ings and a showcase of unsung examples from outside the disciplinary also a persistent critique of modernist heroes such as Le Corbusier, an eleva important outsiders such as Willis Carrier, and, as shown below in the case of Philip Johnson\u2019s Glass House, a cunning confiscation of works typically associated orthodox modern architecture for the cause of \u201cother\u201d possibilities. At the same time, theoretical debates with his contemporaries revealed Banham s stau mitment to core modern movement values and his ongoing struggle be promotion of appropriate visual images for contemporary architecture glance to the technological forces that seem to guarantee the field\u2019s inexorable sli e into invisibility. Technology versus Meaning in Architecture The buildings and writings examined in this chapter were developed a both orthodox modem architecture and the science minded functionalism of an ham\u2019s generation were coming under increasing scrutiny by a younger g ^ of critics and intellectuals. Meaning in Architecture (1969), edited by Ban P Charles Jencks and the Canadian architect and critic George Baird, provides an important portrait of the burgeoning debate. As the editors opined, the 00 an attempt to address what they saw as current crises in architecture, hand, there is a general crisis over such issues as revolution and change wit in arc tecture (some authors wishing to jettison\u2018architecture\u2019altogether) an on t eo hand there is a specific crisis over what \u2018meaning in architecture (or, rat er, mean ings\u2019) is relevant.\u201d2 To account for the various positions at play, the editors Philip Johnson (American, 1906 2005).

New York, The Museum of Modern Art. essays by authors harboring diametrically opposed viewpoints and allowed themselves as well as each contributor to add marginal comments to one another\u2019s texts. For the most part, the contributors to Meaning in Architecture examined these crises through a specifically structuralist lens. The writings of Claude Levi Strauss resonate through nearly all the collected essays, and while Gillo Dorfles and Geoffrey Broadbent each raised concerns about the importation of his and other extra disciplinary theoretical frameworks into architecture, the structuralist position of seeing architecture as a mode of communication was generally adopted throughout, as evidenced by a pervasive engagement of themes such as language, primitivism, essential patterns, and historical continuity.3 Banham provided a glaring exception with his offerings, which specifically opposed Baird\u2019s contribution, \u2018\u201cLa Dimension Amoureuse\u2019 in Architecture,\u201d with invocations of technology, futurism, innovation, and historical rupture. In his text, Baird attempted to demonstrate the bankruptcy of prevailing modes of architectural design by attacking two representative projects, Eero Saarinen\u2019s CBS Building in New York (1965) (fig 3 0 and Cedric Price\u2019s Potteries Thinkbelt proposed for Staffordshire, England (1964 66) (fig. 3.2).4 The former project stood for the \u201ctotal design\u201d tactics typical of the modernist establishment, while the latter, with its ruthless functionalism and open scorn for traditional aesthetics, represented the \u201cempirical method\u201d adopted by many of the younger generation. Despite these differences, Baird saw the two works as more similar than different, with both finding their ideological roots in the distant past. In his view, \u201cthe concept of \u2018total design\u2019 underlying CBS, like Walter Gropius\u2019 ideas of \u2018total theatre\u2019 and \u2018total architecture,\u2019 was nothing more nor less than a Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk. And Price\u2019s idea of architecture as 'life conditioning\u2019 rested on essentially the same view of human experience as Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Panopticon.\u201d5 Both projects, he continued, derived from a nineteenth century \u201closs of faith in rhetoric\u201d that had caused their architects to misconstrue architecture\u2019s communicative role in society, which Baird portrayed as fundamental.5 In Baird\u2019s view, human society was structured as a communication network, and architecture\u2019s role in society had primarily to do with the production and transmission of meaning. With CBS and the Thinkbelt, he argued, both Saarinen and Price naively attempted to hold \u201cprivileged positions\u201d within society\u2019s communication network by attempting to exert rigid control over the way their respective projects produced legible meaning through architectural form. Saarinen, he claimed, worked to \u201cheighten [the] experience\u201d of the occupants of his building through a careful and elegant coordination of all elements in the environment. Price, by contrast, attempted to dissipate the architectural object into a functionalist milieu unencumbered by outmoded aesthetic or symbolic conventions. Both architects, Baird reasoned, eliminated the possibility of ambiguity and irony to register in their work and ultimately impoverished communication. Saarinen, he claimed, treated his audience like children, Price, like objects. Richer modes of architectural communication were available by taking cues from Levi Strauss\u2019s anthropological research, through which an architect would learn to understand the relationship between architecture\u2019s langue (codes) and parole (individual works); would learn to take seriously into account the impact of both present and historical contexts; and would learn to \u201cdesign in his fellows\u2019 experience, rather than above it, or outside it.\u201d7 To do so would be to offer the possibility of a truly meaningful architecture (as opposed to Saarinen\u2019s empty symbolism or Price\u2019s vapid utility), to regain the power of rhetoric in architecture, and to trade in the responsibility and tolerance he associated, in an echo of Roland Barthes, with architecture\u2019s \u201camorous dimension.\u201d8 Banham saw things differently and cleaved to a distinctly more pragmatic position. In Baird\u2019s attempt to recalibrate architecture as a mechanism of meaningful communication, Banham found little more than a conservative appeal to tradition, habit, and convention. With respect to the Thinkbelt, where Baird saw either meaningless utility or, worse, Benthamesque \u201cconditioning,\u201d Banham saw a \u201cnearly value free\u201d environment devoid of \u201cother people\u2019s values left over from the past.\u201d Such an environment might be \u201ccapable of generating new values symbiotically with its inhabitants,\u201d but Baird and his \u201capologists,\u201d he reasoned, were wary of such projects because they appeared to sanction the formation of subject positions different from those one would expect from traditional campus architecture.9 Banham was unperturbed by this move away from the status quo. For him, the Thinkbelt signaled a powerful alternative future for the field. Such \u201calmost value free\u201d environments were the focus of Banham\u2019s two other texts reprinted in Meaning in Architecture, Flatscape with Containers and A Home Is Not a House.\u201d10 Both focused on environments that evaded the conventions of traditional architecture to produce an alternative spatial and social milieu. Banham s position in both essays was decidedly antimonumental, with the former examining the architectural effects of the so called container revolution in shipping and the latter waxing poetic on the near future possibilities of inflatable construction and mechanical environmental control systems. The constructions of \u201cflatscapes\u201d moved architecture well beyond both the conventional monumental patterns Banham saw as limiting the potential of contemporary architecture and the timeless ritual patterns that could be gleaned from the anthropological study of primitive cultures. Where Levi Strauss\u2019s writings might suggest compelling continuities between then and now, Banham saw in new projects, such as the docklands at Tilbury outside London, nothing but jarring ruptures between now and then. No longer serviced by a landscape of monumental warehouse buildings in picturesque brick, Banham pointed out that contemporary goods transportation was carried out in weather tight containers that needed no buildings at all. And despite the protestations of critics such as Baird, he reasoned that architects sooner or later would have to deal with these new antimonumental landscapes \u2014 landscapes not only bereft of traditional values but often also devoid of buildings\u2014if they were to keep pace with the relentless march of technology. Banham outlined one possible future in \u201cA Home Is Not a House. Here, he combined the increasing presence of mechanical equipment in contemporary construction with a somewhat cheeky line of argumentation that foregrounded a tradition in American culture to eschew monumentality in favor of the great outdoors.\u201d11 Such tendencies, he reasoned, worked against conventional architecture and, taken together, might catalyze a radically alternative vision of human habitation. In Banham\u2019s view, America\u2019s architectural development was one of inexorable dissipation into nature: \u201cIf dirty old Nature could be kept under the proper degree of control (sex left in, streptococci taken out) by other means, the United States would be happy to dispense with architecture and buildings altogether.\u201d12 With a typical nod to Buckminster Fuller, he arrived at a possible vehicle of a habitation revolution: \u201cA standard of living package (the phrase and the concept are both Bucky Fuller\u2019s) that really worked might, like so many sophisticated inventions, return Man nearer to a natural state in spite of his complex culture.\u201d In an ironic play on contemporary invocations of Levi Strauss, the technology minded Banham offered his own link to humanity\u2019s \u201cnatural state.\u201d He continued with mythical rumination on humanity\u2019s primal modes of inhabitation: \u201cMan started with two basic ways of controlling environment: one by avoiding the issue and hiding under a rock, tree, tent, or roof (this led ultimately to architecture as we know it) and the other by actually interfering with the local meteorology, usually by means of a campfire, which, in a more polished form, might lead to the kind of situation now under discussion.\u201d In contrast to the massive and static nature of traditional enclosures, the campfire offers an environment characterized by \u201cfreedom and variability.\u201d Defined not by walls and roofs but rather by emitted light and heat, the habitable zone around the campfire accommodates activities more loosely and embraces, rather than evicts, its natural surroundings. Banham\u2019s \u201cstandard of living package\u201d operated along similar lines. But rather than support the primitive fireside activities he mockingly cited (\u201cshrinking a human head,\u201d \u201cthe floating knuckle bones game\u201d), new technology offered a decidedly more contemporary scene. An oft quoted passage described \u201ca properly set up standard of living package, breathing out warm air along the ground (instead of sucking in cold air like a campfire), radiating soft light and Dionne Warwick in heart warming stereo, with well aged protein turning in an infra red glow in the rotisserie, and the ice maker discreetly coughing cubes into glasses on the swing out bar.\u201d Completing this portrait of a technologically enhanced return to a primitive state were Franqois Dallegret\u2019s famous accompanying drawings (see pi. 9).

Over the ensuing pages, Banham went on, in a predictive reverie reminiscent of Paul Scheerbart\u2019s 1914 Glasarchitektur, to offer a lavish depiction of new lifestyle possibilities interspersed with plausible technical solutions for their delivery.13 Thus, while appearing to proceed with tongue firmly in cheek, Banham offered a seriously considered alternative to the growing interest in low tech primitivism that was sweeping through architectural culture in the mid 1960s. Where the structuralist approach embraced in Meaning in Architecture led many to treat building as a primal mode of communication evidenced in the humblest ancient human shelters, Banham\u2019s technological take on the theme projected humanity to a time before constructed shelter altogether to identify a fork in the mythical road of architectural history. One path (\u201chiding under a rock\u201d) led inexorably to the conventions of traditional architecture. The other (\u201cinterfering with the local meteorology\u201d) charted a radically alternative trajectory. Engineer versus Bricoleur Alongside the interest in primal patterns of culture and communication already mentioned, Levi Strauss introduced the notion of bricolage, an important theme that would be addressed by several architects throughout the 1960s and \u201970s. The anthropologist introduced the term in the first chapter of his influential book La pensee sauvage (1962; The Savage Mind, 1966), where he deployed it as an analogy for the \u201cmythical thought\u201d of so called primitive cultures.14 His aim was to demonstrate the intellectual efficacy of such cultures by comparing the language patterns and conceptual foundations of non Western tribes with modern scientific thought. Scientific thought, he explained, dealt primarily in abstract concepts while mythical thought relied largely on direct observation of concrete reality. The seeming absence of abstraction from mythical thought, however, did not entail an absence of conceptual thinking, but rather it represented a different approach to the more fundamental problem of finding order in the sensible world. Where science advanced by means of verifiable knowledge alone, he argued, it must pay for its rigorous defensibility by allowing a degree of uncertainty and openness (for example, unproven hypotheses and other conceptual lacunae) to remain in the system. Mythical thought tolerated no such uncertainty; it filled in the gaps between observable facts with unverifiable concepts (such as magic and witchcraft) to maintain a closed system. While such closure came at a price too dear for science and thus typically was dismissed as irrational, mythical thought\u2019s fundamental expediency, Levi Strauss concluded, offered nonscientific cultures discernible advantages, and it often was able to beat science to the punch, sometimes leading to \u201cbrilliant unforeseen results\u201d independent (and often well in advance) of scientific cultures.15 Levi Strauss clarified the relationship between these two modes of thought with his famous comparison of allegorical figures associated with each mode \u2014the engineer and the bricoleur. An oft quoted passage warrants full citation here: The \u201cbricoleur\u201d is still someone who works with his hands and uses devious means compared to those of the craftsman....The \u201cbricoleur\u201d is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks; but, unlike the engineer, he does not subordinate each of them to the availability of raw materials and tools conceived and procured for the purpose of the project. His universe of instruments is closed and the rules of his game are always to make do with \u201cwhatever is at hand,\u201d that is to say with a set of tools and materials which is always finite and is also heterogeneous because what it contains bears no relationship to the current project, or indeed to any particular project, but is the contingent result of all the occasions there have been to renew or enrich the stock or to maintain it with the remains of previous constructions or destructions. The set of the \u201cbricoleur\u2019s\u201d means cannot therefore be defined in terms of a project (which would presuppose besides, that, as in the case of the engineer, there were, at least in theory, as many sets of tools and materials or \u201cinstrumental sets,\u201d as there are different kinds of projects). It is to be defined only by its potential use or, putting this another way in the language of the \u201cbricoleur\u201d himself, because the elements are collected or retained on the principle that \u201cthey may always come in handy.\u201d16 In other words, the bricoleur works with \u201cwhatever fragments were available.\u201d17 Indeed, Levi Strauss\u2019s bricoleur resonates distinctly with Robin Middleton\u2019s 1967 description of Alison and Peter Smithson. Middleton did not cite Levi Strauss in his text, but the bricoleur analogy would prove irresistible to many of his contemporaries. Alan Colquhoun, who appealed to Levi Strauss\u2019s Anthropologie structural (1958; Structural Anthropology, 1963) in his contribution to Meaning in Architecture, engaged Levi Strauss\u2019s ideas throughout his oeuvre and specifically deployed both myth and bricolage to structure a 1978 discussion of the work of Michael Graves.18 That same year saw the publication of Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter\u2019s influential book Collage City, in which they reproduced almost exactly the passage from The Savage Mind cited above.19 Here, reiterating Baird\u2019s arguments in \u201c'La Dimension Amoureuse\u2019 in Architecture,\u201d Rowe and Koetter seized upon the concept of bricolage to counter Gropius\u2019s idea of total architecture and what they described as \u201cthe still shining afterglow of a unitary and holistic utopian faith.\u201d20 The year 1978 also saw an important publication in English of Jacques Derrida\u2019s famous 1966 lecture, \u201cLa structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines\u201d (\u201cStructure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\u201d).21 This text would receive significant attention during architecture\u2019s flirtations with deconstruction in the 1980s, but it found little traction in architectural circles in the wake of its initial presentation.22 In it, as Rowe and Koetter would do in Collage City, Derrida aligned Levi Strauss\u2019s work with a critique of prevailing notions of stability and centrality: \u201cIt is here that we rediscover the mythopoetical virtue of bricolage. In effect, what appears most fascinating in this critical search for a new status of discourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a subject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute archia.\u201d23 The crucial term here is appears. In typical fashion, Derrida quickly turned the observation back on itself: If Levi Strauss, better than any other, has brought to light the play of repetition and the repetition of play, one no less perceives in his work a sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self presence in speech \u2014an ethic, nostalgia, and even remorse, which he often presents as the motivation of the ethnological project when he moves toward the archaic societies which are exemplary societies in his eyes.24 By the 1980s, Derrida\u2019s critical domestication of Levi Strauss largely would be accepted across the cultural landscape.25 But if architectural culture remained unperturbed by Derrida\u2019s arguments into the mid 1970s, its exponents had become comfortably familiar with the general content of the Levi Strauss\u2019s work. Robert Maxwell, in a 1976 text, offered a typical demonstration of the attitude while conveniently summarizing its distinctly English resonances: \u201cLong before Claude Levi Strauss\u2019s bricolage was proposed as an alternative to engineering, [Ivor] de Wolfe was on to the art of bric a brac assembly as the only way to put visual coherence into our \u2018brickish a brackish mid century world of barbed wire...\u2019 Because our landscape was the product of unhappy accident, the happy accident had to be cultivated.\u201d26 In this, Maxwell illustrated (but was careful not to subscribe to) a pervasive misreading of Levi Strauss\u2019s analysis in English architectural circles. Levi Strauss did not offer bricolage as an alternative to engineering; rather, he used the term as a metaphor for how mythical thought operated. In a treatment of art practices that immediately followed the section on bricolage, Levi Strauss clearly indicated his view that \u201cart lies half way between scientific knowledge and mythical or magical thought. It is common knowledge that the artist is both something of a scientist and of a \u2018bri coleur\u201d\u201927 Rowe and Koetter recognized this distinction. They argued not for \u201cthe architect as \u2018bricoleur\u2019\u201d but rather enthusiastically promoted a synthetic position similar to Levi Strauss\u2019s characterization of the artist: \u201cThe artist (architect) as both something of a bricoleur and something of a scientist!\u201d Such a combination, they surmised, could produce \u201ca truly useful dialectic\u201d elicited from \u201creestablishing \u2018bri colage\u2019 alongside science\u201d as a corrective to contemporary urban planning.28 Charles Jencks, writing in 1972, advanced a far more partisan position in Adhocism: The Case for Improvisation. At the outset of his section of the book, Jencks reproduced the lines from The Savage Mind cited by Rowe and Koetter (and above). But where Rowe and Koetter used the quotation to sanction a dialectical synthesis of engineering and bricolage, Jencks used it to propose a shift in sensibility from the methods of the former to those of the latter. Though he noted that \u201cthe distinction between bricolage and engineering of science is one of degree and intention rather than kind or quality,\u201d his preference was clear: \u201cThe scientist is intent on using the tools and hypothesis appropriate to his job, whereas the bricoleur or adhocist is intent on undertaking his job immediately, with whatever resources are available.\u201d29 Throughout, Jencks attacked both totalizing and empirical design methods and demonized modern architecture. Adhocism, he argued, offered a means to overcome the stultifying bureaucracies and oppressive theories that had come to overshadow individual needs in the late twentieth century. Further, the adhocist/ bricoleur apparently offered the chance to reclaim theoretical territory ceded to the engineer by Le Corbusier in Vers une architecture. Jencks challenged mainstream modern architecture by invoking such varied developments as electronic communication, cybernetics, hippie culture, the do it yourself movement, and the space program. He ultimately proposed an alternative mode of design that proceeded not toward the mechanized standards of engineered mass production but rather toward the expedient combination of preexisting and readily available parts into heterogeneous new wholes. Jencks would harden his position against modern architecture in later writings. In his influential Language of Post Modern Architecture (1977), he further articulated the pluralistic agenda he had first set down in the dissertation he completed at London University under Banham\u2019s supervision in 1970.30 Beyond its usefulness in resisting modern architecture\u2019s status quo, Levi Strauss\u2019s formulation of bricolage, along with Jencks\u2019s own compositional proclivities, breathed new life into particularly English modes of architectural composition that had seen both enthusiastic reception and vehement rejection in the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s. Proponents of the nostalgic proposals of Townscape, the brash juxtapositions of clip on, and Jencks\u2019s postmodern pluralism each could find a convenient theoretical alibi in Levi Strauss\u2019s notion of bricolage. Unlike his ambitious pupil, Banham would remain committed to modern architecture\u2019s core values and resistant to any potential resonance with the picturesque (and what he saw as its inherent provincialism) throughout his career. Even as he advanced the technological expediency of clip on architecture, he was careful not to embrace fully its visual character and compositional implications. And if he made his initial ambivalence about clip on known largely through insinuation, his resistance to adhocism and the mythology of the bricoleur was vocal and emphatic. For Banham, the engineer, the bricoleur, and the methodological distinction from which they were produced were pure myth, the product of a generation of \u201cacademics bricolating theories out of other people\u2019s books.\u201d Bricolage, in his view, did not represent an alternative to engineering but rather \u201cthe way the world has always worked.\u201d31 He cited an array of examples from engineering\u2014from space capsules to Ferrari race cars \u2014that demonstrated that engineers tend not to \u201cconceiv[e] and procur[e] everything specially for the project,\u201d but rather, because they are driven for the most part by profit, that they work primarily with components \u201coff the peg\u201d and \u201cex catalogue.\u201d32 He continued, \u201cEven if, as Jencks sagely observes, the difference between Bricoleur and Engineer is one of degree, then on an evenly graded scale from the one to the other, practically everybody, including the engineers, is going to be up the brico end.\u201d33 In this, Banham reached a conclusion nearly identical to the one Derrida arrived at over a decade earlier: \u201cAs soon as we admit that every finite discourse is bound by a certain bricolage and that the engineer and the scientist are also species of bricoleurs, then the very idea of bricolage is menaced and the difference in which it took on its meaning breaks down.\u201d34 And while the farcical portrayal of the engineer as \u201cSatan\u201d in this new \u201cbricosmology\u201d might offend Banham the engineer, it was the widespread acceptance of this \u201ctrifling metaphor\u201d that more deeply troubled Banham the scholar. He found the idea \u201cworrying in that it is only a symptom of a general ignorance about engineering among those who profess to tell us what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right with western culture, and \u2014above all\u2014what\u2019s wrong with engineering as a part of that culture.\u201d35 Of course, Banham was not simply defending engineering as a profession; he was at the same time defending modern architecture as a discipline. This marks an important turn in Banham\u2019s writing. Throughout the 1960s, Banham had maintained the position of the enfant terrible of architectural discourse.36 His early writing set out to correct interpretations of modern architecture that had misconstrued the relationship between modern aesthetics and the functional principles on which they were based. Banham had placed much of the blame at the feet of his dissertation adviser, Nikolaus Pevsner, which added a personal, Oedipal component to his labors. But in the mid 1970s, Banham faced a modern movement suffering not from internal contradictions \u2014 the promotion of a puritanical style often at odds with that movement\u2019s underlying functional principles \u2014 but rather from external attacks that fundamentally opposed both modern architecture\u2019s appearance and its principles. Worse, those attacks emanated from a talented scholar whom Banham himself had trained. Jencks offered his polemic writings not to correct the modern movement but rather to advocate for its replacement. And if, as Nigel Whiteley has pointed out, Jencks appeared to have mastered many of his mentor\u2019s rhetorical techniques, it was the younger historian\u2019s adoption of Pevsner\u2019s approach \u2014 his concentration on outward appearance, attentiveness to stylistic labels, and predilection for picturesque massing\u2014that gave his writing much of the force necessary to challenge Banham\u2019s compelling arguments and formidable reputation.37 An assessment of Jencks\u2019s writings demonstrates that it was not toward the bri coleur\u2019s tactics but rather toward the visual character of an architect\u2019s output that he directed the bulk of his attention. This marks an important distinction from other appeals to Levi Strauss encountered previously. Jencks, like Baird, was committed to shifting architecture away from the technologically focused modern movement toward an understanding of architecture that saw legible meaning (as communicated through constructed form) as a primary motivating factor. Of course, modern architecture, and indeed its foremost manifesto, Vers une architecture, also had been concerned with formal legibility, as evidenced by Le Corbusier\u2019s careful graphic design and famous visual comparisons of Greek temples and contemporary automobiles.38 But in Jencks\u2019s Post Modern turn,39 the name of the game was no longer the suggestion of idealized perfection through the use of Euclidean forms but rather polyvalent meanings that spoke at once to expert audiences within the discourse as well as to popular audiences at large.40 George Baird and other advocates of what would soon mature into architectural postmodernism similarly were concerned with a broader understanding of architectural communication and the necessary grappling with attendant ambiguities such an understanding would entail, but Jencks's innovation was to offer a catalog of new visual examples \u2014and a growing vocabulary of equally new stylistic labels\u2014for the buildings he hoped would emerge from this new idiom.41 His gambit would pay off handsomely. Where Adhocism offered precious few contemporary buildings that embodied its compositional ambitions (by necessity given its early date of publication), The Language of Post Modern Architecture was full of them. Indeed, the page count of later editions ballooned as Jencks quickly collected, identified, and classified new built work and stylistic trends in his popular and ever expanding catalog.42 At the same time, his initial position that \"accept[ed] everyone as an architect\u201d slackened somewhat as he sanctioned not a wider array of design practitioners but rather a wider popular audience to be addressed by the architectural establishment43 While bricolage might have been suggested to Jencks by the DIY craftsmen and hippie dropouts in the late 1960s and early \u201970s, by the 1980s, he was advocating the approach in order to influence established professionals at the center rather than precocious amateurs at the fringe. Thus, as for Levi Strauss before him, the bricoleur was for Jencks not the crux of a theory but an expedient means to an end. The character was not mentioned again after the opening pages of Adhocism and would not return in Jencks\u2019s later writings, in which the visual character of architectural form remained the primary concern.44 Ironically, and despite his condescending attacks, Banham would embrace certain qualities associated with the concept throughout his career. Jencks\u2019s argumentation from the late 1960s would move the younger critic toward a careful taxonomy of architectural imagery. Banham, by contrast, would move increasingly to engage architecture\u2019s technological drive toward invisibility. Boffins and the Well Tempered Environment Banham saw the myth of the bricoleur as little more than an attempt to expand architectural discourse in order to engage the \u201coperational lore\u201d of Continental academe. And as a \u201cpurely academic construct,\u201d45 Levi Strauss\u2019s portrayal of the engineer displayed little of the \u201capparent intelligence\u201d Banham routinely celebrated in figures such as Buckminster Fuller. Nonetheless, Fuller embodied many of the qualities that popular architectural opinion had enshrined in the figure of the bricoleur. Of course, Fuller also displayed a deep commitment to \u201cthe dreaded technostructure\u201d Jencks railed against46 and easily could be characterized as a Levi Straussian engineer \u201calways trying to make his way out of and go beyond the constraints imposed by a particular state of civilization.\u201d47 A better label for the kind of designer Banham celebrated is the British term boffin. Though its etymology is uncertain, the designation has been linked to radar scientists associated with the Royal Air Force during World War II.48 Boffin quickly entered into popular usage throughout Great Britain and its former territories as an endearing description of a clever tinkerer/scientist typically working in secret or obscurity and often possessing marginal social skills. Q, the quirky inventor featured in Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond novels of the 1950s and \u201960s and, more substantially, in their subsequent film adaptations from 1962, is a prototypical boffin. The term quickly found its way into English architectural conversation. Banham would praise Independent Group member Frank Cordell as \u201cTop Pop Boffin\u201d in 1958 49 and, as Simon Sadler pointed out, \u201cArchigram\u2019s self styled eccentricity shared affinities with the boffin subculture of systems design.\u201d50 By 1970, Peter Cook would invoke the \u2018\u201cboffin\u2019 designer\u201d as an alternative to the \u2018\u201cartist\u2019 designer.\u201d51 Cook later expanded on his formulation, linking the idea directly to High Tech architects: There are two traditions of good English architects. Those who are basically artists, and for whom, the natural eccentricity and episodicness [sic] of our culture has led to an occasional series of quaint distortions of the European traditions. The others are boffins \u2014or mechanics. There is that stream of English fiddlers with cars, builders of boats, cannibalisers and people who always seem to have another way of using a working part from the one that you expect. In recent years, the originality of the Smithsons, Cedric Price, Norman Foster, and the Rogers team seem to have had far more to do with the latter instinct.52 Banham always had been drawn to such fringe personalities, as evidenced by the attention he directed at Pierre Chareau, Buckminster Fuller, and Jean Prouve, among others. A decade before Cook\u2019s comments on the boffin tradition, Ban ham set down similar sentiments in \u201ci960 \u2014 Stocktaking\u201d: \u201cThe service that architects propose to perform for society can often be accomplished without calling in an architect in the sense discussed in the article that runs parallel to this, and the increasing range of technological alternatives to bricks and mortar may yet set a term to the custom sanctioned monopoly of architects as environment purveyors to the human race.\u201d53 These alternatives often were developed by \u201cperipheral radicals\u201d such as Fuller, \u201cwhose ideas call the whole professional apparatus into question.\u201d54 Banham frequently returned to Fuller\u2019s boffinesque tendencies as indications of an alternative way of working that operated alongside architecture\u2019s mainstream rather than within it. His praise of Fuller\u2019s 1927 Dymaxion House in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i960) provides a telling example: The Dymaxion concept was entirely radical, a hexagonal ring of dwelling space, walled in double skins of plastic in different transparencies according to lighting needs, and hung by wires from the apex of a central duralumin mast which also housed all the mechanical services. The formal qualities of this design are not remarkable, except in combination with the structural and planning methods involved. The structure does not derive from the imposition of a Perret esque or Elementarist aesthetic on a material that has been elevated to the level of a symbol for \u201cthe machine,\u201d but is an adaptation of light metal methods employed in aircraft construction at the time. The planning derives from a liberated attitude to those mechanical services that had precipitated the whole Modern adventure by their invasion of homes and streets before 1914.55 The passage neatly encapsulates many of the themes Banham pursued in his writings through the 1960s: an embrace of new structural and organizational principles, an interest in new materials (particularly translucent, lightweight skins), a disregard of academic compositional methods and expressive ambitions (accompanied by thinly veiled jabs at Le Corbusier), the adaptation of extradisciplinary technology to architectural uses, and, significantly, \u201ca liberated attitude to... mechanical services.\u201d Banham investigated each of these themes and the boffin designers that embraced them in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment of 1969. In his famous history of environmental technology in architecture, Banham attempted to unseat the primary role given to structure and style in traditional histories by offering an unprecedented account of the role of mechanical services and environmental performance. As Theory and Design presented Fuller as a hero from the fringe whose bold experimentation offers technological salvation to the field, The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment reserved pride of place for other peripheral figures that comfortably fit the boffin mold. As Banham put it, The history of the mechanization of environmental management is a history of extrem ists, otherwise most of it would never have happened. The fact that many of these extremists were not registered, or otherwise recognized as architects, in no way alters the magnitude of the contribution they have made to the architecture of our time.\u201d Underlining the practical applications of documenting these achievements, he continued, \u201cPerhaps finding such men a place in the history of architecture will be some help in resolving the vexing problems of finding their proper place in the practice of architecture.\u201d56 In many ways, the book was an elaboration of A Home Is Not a House. Once again, a parable about humankind\u2019s prehistoric condition was deployed to introduce two fundamental modes of dealing with the problem of environmental control\u2014 one focused on massive structure and the other on applied power, with the former leading to architecture as we know it. Banham went on to chronicle humankind\u2019s exponentially increased ability to control its environment with applied power (primarily electricity) throughout the nineteenth century and to lament the bias toward massive structure and outward appearance generally maintained by architectural historians. Attempting to correct this bias, Banham set out to write what he called \u201ca purely architectural history.\u201d57 Banham also documented a number of little known nineteenth century works with which boffinesque designers attempted to mitigate the foul atmospheric conditions brought on by rapid urbanization, such as John Hayward\u2019s 1867 house for himself, the Octagon, in Liverpool, which deployed a clever plan arrangement to provide an early version of what are now referred to as air changes.,8 Later, Banham examined Thomas Edison\u2019s groundbreaking work on electricity, noting that Edison\u2019s true import \u201chas less to do with the practicable lamp bulb... than with his invention and assembly of the complete system to supply that lamp with commercially profitable electricity.\u201d59 Importantly, in each of these cases, the innovations were largely invisible. Hayward\u2019s plan arrangement (central lobbies at each floor) was not uncommon, and the openings that allowed air to travel between floors were discretely screened with decorative metalwork. Edison\u2019s power network, while having a visible trace in the urban milieu, had little visible impact on inhabited interiors\u2014wiring from the first was concealed within walls.60 The actual light sources that Edison\u2019s innovations made possible, however, introduced unprecedented problems for design professionals. A survey of early modern experiments with lighting design afforded Banham the opportunity to celebrate some lesser figures (Paul Scheer bart, Bruno Taut), to castigate some accepted masters (Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier), and to extol achievements in America (by Richard Neutra, Rudolf Schindler, and Frank Lloyd Wright), all common tactics \u2014 and targets \u2014 encountered throughout his writings. There is a decidedly American slant to The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment. While European innovators (and fringe modernists) such as Pierre Chareau garnered positive treatment, Banham largely maintained a position that had European architects perfecting a dogmatic style while American designers busied themselves with the more pragmatic task of inventing workable technical solutions to the challenges presented by new technology. The development of air conditioning offered a compelling case. After a withering treatment of Le Corbusier\u2019s technical failures in that arena, Banham discussed the architect\u2019s fascination with American air conditioning.61 His remarks set up one of the book\u2019s central provocations: While European modern architects had been trying to devise a style that would \u201ccivilize technology,\u201d US engineers had devised a technology that would make the modern style of architecture habitable by human beings. In the process they had come within an ace of producing a workable alternative to buildings as the unique means of managing the environment, and had thus come within an ace of making architecture culturally obsolete, at least in the sense in which \u201carchitecture\u201d had been traditionally understood, the sense in which Le Corbusier had written Vers une architecture.62 As in \u201cA Home Is Not a House,\u201d American technical innovation appeared poised to render architecture in the Western tradition obsolete. And it was in an arena largely outside the purview of traditional architectural histories that Banham found a quintessential boffin hero, Willis Carrier, the inventor of air conditioning.63 In the early years of the twentieth century, Carrier\u2019s pragmatic, profit driven approach had him applying his system of \u201cman made weather\u201d first in factories, where economic justifications for the application of this new and expensive technology could be made. Later, assisted by low heat fluorescent light fixtures, office buildings could adopt the technology. The combination of air conditioning and electric lighting made possible the replacement of the involuted and inefficient floor plans of traditional fig. 3 4 Frank Lloyd Wright (American, 1867 1959).

A similar formal freedom was soon afforded to domestic architecture, as packaged air conditioning units allowed builders to eschew conservative approaches to environmental management and to make any configuration habitable in any climate with the adequate provision of Carrier\u2019s technology. For Banham, Willis Carrier had spearheaded a momentous architectural revolution. With his invention, \u201call precepts for climate compensation through structure and form are rendered obsolete.\u201d64 Ironically, the lack of visual expression for these technical innovations necessitated the commissioning of a large number of illustrations for the book. Beautiful and informative cutaway axonometric diagrams by Mary Banham, the author\u2019s wife and an accomplished draftsperson, are masterful achievements in architectural representation that reveal not the visual appearance but rather the technical functioning of the buildings discussed (see figs. 3.5, 3.7). Like Franqois Dallegret\u2019s drawings for \"A Home Is Not a House\u201d (see fig. 3.3), they provided a compelling visual complement to Banham\u2019s forceful prose. But where Dallegret\u2019s images lent an air of conventional monumentality to Banham\u2019s futuristic reverie and thus undercut his arguments,65 Mary Banham\u2019s crisp, clinical drawings amplified the technical veracity of the historian\u2019s endeavor. Maintaining Modern Architecture Though Banham was highly critical of many architects and historians of the modern movement (including his mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner) in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, the underdog did not always triumph, as an early example makes clear. Both Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Larkin Building (1903 6) in Buffalo (figs. 3.4, 3.5) and Henman and Cooper\u2019s Royal Victoria Hospital (1903) in Belfast (figs. 3.6, 3.7) made significant advances in environmental control. And though the Royal Victoria Hospital provided true air conditioning and the Larkin Building did not,66 it was Wright\u2019s building that ultimately came out ahead. The Larkin Building, Banham explained, combined its technical achievement with a progressive visual expression that engaged the stylistic development of modern architecture. The Royal Victoria Hospital, by contrast, was \u201cthoroughly discounted and out of fashion among consciously progressive architects of 1900 \u201d67 Had Banham\u2019s ambition been simply to reject aesthetics in favor of environmental performance, the Royal Victoria Hospital would have made the case handily. But Banham\u2019s book was not a history of environmental controls\u2014it was an architectural history that took environmental controls into account. As such, a conscious engagement of prevailing aesthetic sensibilities remained an integral part of the equation.

United Nations Headquarters (New York, 1950). Curtain wall detail. If Banham\u2019s preference for the Larkin Building illustrated his commitment to modern architecture, his comparison of details at Wallace Harrison\u2019s United Nations Headquarters Building (1950) and Gordon Bunshaft\u2019s Lever House (1951) (figs. 3.8 3.11), both in New York City, reinforced his disdain for ad hoc compositions. The two buildings were provided with required masonry firewalls at the slab edge, projecting up two feet six inches from the floor level. These masonry elements were masked in each case with an opaque glass spandrel panel on the facade and a radiator enclosure on the interior. At Lever House, Bunshaft mirrored the upstand firewall/spandrel on the facade with a similar downstand element, providing a clean stop to the plenum space above the suspended ceilings at each floor that was duly marked on the facade. At the UN, Harrison chamfered the plenum space to a minimal dimension at the facade, leaving just enough room for a heating duct to feed the radiator above and allowing the vision glass at each floor to rise nearly all the way to the upper floor slab, which afforded no visual index of the plenum space on the facade. For Banham, the latter detail \u201cmay be ingenious, but minds and the well tempered environment it is hardly an elegant solution.\u201d The former, however, \u201cprovides an excellent mask for the end of a suspended ceiling space amply deep for a full array of services; and the binary nature of this upstand downstand solution is acknowledged with due honesty on the exterior.\u201d68 As he had done in his exchange with Jencks over Adhocism, Banham displayed an unflinching commitment to legible, elegant, and honest visual coherence. This attitude is consistent throughout the book. Examples as diverse as drive in movie theaters, inflatable structures, and Emslie Morgan\u2019s St. George\u2019s School (Wallasey, Cheshire, 1961)\u2014a work that employed heavy masonry construction and passive solar techniques \u2014 derived their expressive effects from the thoughtful solution of environmental challenges with what Banham would later term \u201cappropriate technology.\u201d69 Some examples, such as the Las Vegas Strip, swerved daringly far from established architectural norms. Others, such as Victor Lundy\u2019s United States Atomic Energy Commission Pavilion (erected at various locations from 1959), merged familiar elements with cutting edge technology. Others still, such as fig. 3.10 Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (Gordon Bunshaft, American, 1909 90). Lever House (New York, 1951). Curtain wall detail. FIG. 3.11 Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill (Gordon Bunshaft, American, 1909 90). Lever House (New York, 1951). General view. Morgan\u2019s St. George\u2019s School, found both environmental performance and cogent expression in traditional forms. In each case, the expression derived directly from the technology employed. At times, these forms coincided with the formal preferences (though not the mainstream rhetoric) of the modern movement. To illustrate, Banham included cunning treatments of Philip Johnson\u2019s Glass House (1949) at New Canaan (figs. 3.12, 3.13; see pi. 10) in both \u201cA Home Is Not a House\u201d and The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment. In the earlier text, he detached the house from its well known European roots and recast it as typically American: fig. 3.12 Philip Johnson (American, 1906 2005). Glass House (New Canaan, Connecticut, 1949). General view. Washington, D.C., Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division. Carol M. Highsmith Archive. So much has been misleadingly said (by Philip Johnson himself, as well as others) to prove this a work of architecture in the European tradition, that its many intensely American aspects are usually missed. Yet when you have dug through all the erudition about Ledoux and Malevitsch and Palladio and stuff that has been published, one very suggestive source or prototype remains less easily explained away\u2014the admitted persistence in Johnson\u2019s mind of the visual image of a burned out New England township, the insubstantial shells of the houses consumed by fire, leaving the brick floor slabs and standing chimneys.70 Lacking a visual enclosure in the traditional sense, the house was dissolved, like the inflatable un house Banham described earlier in the text, to a collection of interior furnishings assembled in the landscape (see fig. 3.12).71 In The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, Banham elucidated the technical elements Johnson deployed to achieve his radical dissolution of architecture. Like Wright before him, Johnson used a hot water heating system (here fully invisible in the radiant brick clad floor slab) to render the space habitable in the winter. His monumental fireplace works \u201cat the mainly ceremonial level of most of Wright\u2019s spectacular hearths.\u201d72 In the summer, the glass shell marshals elements from well beyond the constructed perimeter of the building to boost its environmental performance. As the house is oriented with its long axis parallel to a steep bluff to the west, a stand of trees planted on this ridge at an elevation well below that of the house\u2019s floor level places the trees\u2019 thick deciduous canopy between the house and the oppressive afternoon summer sun. In winter, the bare branches admit the low winter sun to warm the interior (see fig. 3.13). In devising this vegetal brise soleil, Johnson predicted the crafty dissipations of architecture into its neighbor disciplines of landscape and interior design that would be performed two decades later by the Archigram group73 and, as shown below, would become an important ambition among High Tech architects. The Crisis of Invisibility Fifteen years after the initial appearance of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, Banham released a second edition. In it, he substantially revised his earlier conclusions regarding a proper mode of expression arising from appropriate technologies. Consider his treatment of a 1982 house in Santa Cruz, California, fig. 3.13 Philip Johnson (American, 1906 2005). Glass House (New Canaan, Connecticut, 1949). Site plan. House in Santa Cruz, California, 1982, by Thachcr and Thompson; gable and solar oriel window. fig. 3.14 Thacher and Thompson (Tom Thacher, American, b. 1947; Matthew Thompson, American, b. 1948). House (Santa Cruz, California, 1982). Left: View of oriel window. Right: Section of oriel window. From Reyner Banham, The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment (London: Architectural Press, 1969), 309 (detail). by the firm of Thacher and Thompson. A cedar clad cottage with no pretentions to progressive aesthetics, the house deftly incorporated passive environmental solutions. Concrete floor slabs act as heat sinks in winter, while double layers of glass with operable panes in each layer allow the tuning of air convection patterns based on the season (fig. 3.14). All this was invisibly accommodated within a traditional two story oriel window unashamedly centered under the house\u2019s gable roof. For Banham, the radicalism of such works lay not in its outward appearance but rather in the far more subversive liberation of \u201cexpected performance\u201d from \u201cconventional form\u201d that can come from \u201cthe application of radical intelligence and organized knowledge to the ancient craft of building.\u201d74 When faced with the problem of mechanical systems, most of the architects featured in Banham\u2019s book tended toward clever camouflage or blatant exaggeration. Such tactics led nearly every building toward a traditional form of monumentality. The Larkin Building, Centre Georges Pompidou, and even Dallegret\u2019s drawings for \u201cA Home Is Not a House\u201d exhibit this tendency. And though Banham might have managed to squint through the traditional disciplinarity of Johnson\u2019s Glass House to glean indication of an \u201cother\u201d agenda at work, Thacher and Thompson\u2019s understated \u201cneither nor\u201d approach signaled a more radical possibility. \u201cArchitecturally,\u201d Banham opined, this may leave us with a curious and almost unprecedented problem \u2014 that of the building that is perfectly honest about its functioning, but offers no clues as to what that functioning might be. This may only be seen as a problem in the aftermath of the International Style and Functionalism, when buildings were supposed to advertise their functions and exhibit their technical innovations, but we have to accept that we are still inhabiting that aftermath and are a long way from formulating appropriate alternative approaches.75 As he moved toward his conclusion, his tone grew increasingly melancholic: \u201cArchitecture, as commonly taught, practiced, and understood in the West, is still little more than a peasant vernacular, whatever the triumphs of art it has bequeathed to the human race,\u201d and the cultural force of the \u201challowed forms\u201d of tradition, he reasoned, long since had begun to wane. In the first edition, Banham saw hope that new forms soon would be constructed out of the stuff of environmental control. By 1984, this hope had dimmed significantly. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he concluded, among the buildings discussed and illustrated in these pages, the outlines of a new and relevant language of symbolic forms may be discerned, but one must beg leave doubt it\u2014yet. Such a development is not in the contract, so to speak. It is probably true that only when the architecture of the well tempered environment disposes of a language of symbolic forms as entrenched in our culture as are those of the older dispensation will it be able to hope for equal conviction and monumental authority, but that possibility seems to be excluded by the very nature of the operation which has been chronicled here. The essence of what has been done to temper the environment has been \u2014 at every single stage\u2014the displacement of habit by experiment, and of accepted custom by informed innovation. The greatest of all environmental powers is thought, and the usefulness of thought, the very reason for applying radical intelligence to our problems, is precisely that it dissolves what architecture has been made of to date: customary forms.76 This polemical opposition of traditional forms and innovative technology distinctly echoes argumentation employed by Le Corbusier in Vers une architecture. In his closing chapter, Le Corbusier issued the famous challenge: \u201cArchitecture or Revolution.\u201d77 His method for avoiding that revolution, outlined in preceding chapters, was to fabricate the illusion that architecture\u2019s core principles, its \u201coperational lore,\u201d were aligned with the forces of a technological society. But as was pointed out by Banham and countless critics in his wake, Le Corbusier\u2019s machines a habiter were in fact little more than primal geometries in contemporary costume, cunning attempts to stave off a societal revolution by galvanizing traditional form against the corrosive effects of technology. It is tempting to read Banham\u2019s challenge differently \u2014 Revolution or Architecture\u2014 with the attendant corollary that architecture, not revolution, can be avoided. As he had argued in \"A Home Is Not a House,\u201d human beings (at least Americans) equipped with adequate technology were likely to dissolve architecture in the Western tradition if presented the opportunity. In the fanciful un house, Ban ham offered an extreme version of this scenario, while at Johnson\u2019s Glass House, he found evidence of immanent dissipation at the very heart of orthodox production. The revolution, it seems, had already occurred. When The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment appeared in 1969, Banham already had immersed himself in research on the United States, the country to which he would relocate permanently in 1976. Judging by later titles such as Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971) and Scenes in America Deserta (1982), books committed to the automotive flux of an unruly metropolis and the sublime beauty of an alien landscape,78 Banham apparently had beaten a westerly retreat from the Western tradition. Yet throughout his American sojourn, Banham kept a watchful eye on architectural activities across the Atlantic. And while he might have reveled in the freedoms and opportunities afforded by the dissolution of buildings and the triumph of the automobile, he would continue to bristle at the careless adoption of Continental thought by Jencks and others of the younger generation. In the end, it was to the tenets of modern architecture that Banham remained committed as a historian. Like Le Corbusier, Banham\u2019s ambition was more corrective than revolutionary. The call was still \u201cArchitecture or Revolution,\u201d though the revolution to be avoided was not that of technology, which already had occurred, but rather that of postmodernism. Banham could celebrate an un house, a Glass House, and even the anonymous vernaculars of the American Northeast and Southwest, but he could not stomach the backward looking antics of contemporary postmodernists. Banham was deeply dismayed by the ascendancy of postmodern architecture, and, as the later edition of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment made clear, he found little comfort in the largely irrelevant vernaculars of Emslie Morgan or Thacher and Thompson, however much \u201capparent intelligence\u201d those works might display. In the years that passed between the first appearance of his book and the end of his life, Banham devoted considerable attention not only to the American frontier but also to a group of talented British architects who appeared to agree with his Marxist assertion that if postmodernism represented \u201cthe time when history repeats itself as farce, then it is architecture which is offering to become farcical, not the technologies that have displaced it from its ancient role.\u201d Displaying equal parts boffinesque expedience and traditional elegance, Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and other High Tech practitioners were (and remain) committed, as was Banham, to technology\u2019s \u201cclaim to be a permanent part of the craft of architecture.\u201d79 Though a far cry from the radical examples he extolled in Los Angeles and the American desert, High Tech, with its paradoxical and distinctly English fusion of tradition and technology, appeared, to Banham, better equipped than any alternative to fend off the rising tide of postmodern architecture.

For a good treatment of Banham\u2019s relationship with Jencks, see Nigel Whiteley, Reyner Banham: Historian of the Immediate Future (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2003), 373~77 37 In recounting an exchange of letters between Banham and Jencks that followed the publication of Brico logues,\u201d Whiteley argued that \u201cBanham was being beaten at his own game in his own style\u201d (Whiteley, Reyner Banham, 375). The letters appeared in New Society, 15, 22, and 29 July 1976. PP M'> '95. ar|d 251, respectively. While this exchange coincided with the ascendancy of Jencks in the architectural spotlight and a concurrent fading of influence for Banham, I do not agree with Whiteley\u2019s assessment. In these letters, Jencks maintained an extreme position with regard to engineering practice that discounted the importance of the ad hoc methods Banham described. While Whiteley attempted to align Jencks\u2019s position with the \u201cmacro scale\u201d of the \"technostructure\u201d (Whiteley, Reyner Banham, 375), Derrida\u2019s critique cited above offers a formidable counterpoint. Not only did Banham\u2019s nuanced analysis reiterate Derrida\u2019s position in theory, it was also far more convincing in practice. 38 See Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture [1923], trans. Frederick Etchells (London: John Rodker, 1931), 134 35 39 Following Jencks\u2019s usage, I retain his capitalization and pubescent hyphen, which helps to differentiate his version of the term from later manifestations of postmodernism in architecture, which I discuss below. 40 \u201cA Post Modern building is, if a short definition is needed, one which speaks on at least two levels at once: to other architects and a concerned minority who care about specifically architectural meanings, and to the public at large, or the local inhabitants, who care about other issues concerned with comfort, traditional building and a way of life.\u201d Jencks, The Language of Post Modern Architecture, revised and enlarged edition (New York: Rizzoli, 1977), 6. 41 Jencks\u2019s Language of Post Modern Architecture was a crucial text in the establishment of postmodern architecture. In it, Jencks described \u201cPost Modern\u201d architecture primarily in terms of style, but as the term caught on and the discourse around it developed in architectural circles, the term lost its hyphen and took on implications that resonated with the cultural criticism of such thinkers as Jean Fran^ois Lyotard and Frederic Jameson. See, for example, Lyotard, La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir (Paris: Les Editions Minuit, 1979); English translation by Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1984); and Jameson, \u201cPostmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism,\" New Left Review 146 (July August 1984): 59 92.

CHAPTER 4 HIGH TECH AND THE PERSISTENCE OF MODERNISM High Tech architecture, by most accounts, was born in London in 1967, though its formal and ideological antecedents stretch back into the nineteenth century, and its most important buildings Piano + Rogers's Centre Georges Pompidou (1977; see pi.,3) and Norman Foster's Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Headquarters (,986; see pi. 14) \u2014would not begin to appear until at least a decade later. In 1967, the local architectural community quietly welcomed two modest buildings designed by two like minded and ambitious young firms, Team 4\u2019s Reliance Controls Building (see figs. 4.3, 4.4, 4.6 49, pi. n) in outlying Swindon and the Farrell/Gnmshaw Partnership's Bathroom Tower in the Paddington district of London (see figs. 2.8 2.,o, pi. 4)' Though not technically twins, the buildings share distinctive stylistic and technological affinities. Both were constructed of repetitive steel and glass components and, in their organizational schemata (the former a simple shed designe for axial extension in plan, the latter a rising helix suggesting a similarly extensile section), both adhered,0 the \"endless and indeterminate\" strain of postwar modern architecture.2 Despite these and other similarities, the two buildings also d,splay what might be construed as a form of sibling rivalry. Their contrasting charactens tics one, an elegant assembly of carefully coordinated components, the other, an, ,, _ 0iompnK___exemplify the divergent tendencies expedient juxtaposition of ad hoc elemen P that constitute High Tech architecture. The movement developed smoothly from the historical trajectory traced in preceding chapters. From the New Brutalism, High Tech inherited an ethica commit ment to function and a predilection for \u201cbloodyminded\" consistency. From cl,p on, it,00k an opportunistic flair for ad hoc expediency and a stylistic affinity for elemental accretion. Many of High Tech's foremost practitioners (for example, Nicho as Grimshaw, Michael Hopkins, and Richard Rogers) trained at Londons Architectural Association.School of Architecture and were early under the sway o eynei Foster Associates (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935).

Most were present to witness the early musings of the Archigram group, and they displayed a similar commitment to arrest ing imagery constructed of equal parts space age appropriation and time honored convention.3 And, like Banham, these ambitious young practitioners were as enamored with the no nonsense rationalism of outsiders such as Buckminster Fuller as with the tendency of properly deployed mechanical equipment to vaporize architecture\u2019s traditional monumentality into a nearly invisible environmental milieu. Absorbing opposing tendencies such as these \u2014 often within single buildings\u2014 High Tech was plagued by the contradictions encountered in preceding chapters. Like the New Brutalism, the movement showcased dueling ethical and aesthetic ambitions. Like clip on, its buildings appeared to be driven as much toward symbolic monumentality as toward subservient anonymity. And, like Banham, its main exponents generally exhibited a simultaneous desire for both programmatic freedom and formal control. Above all else, High Tech is an architecture of oppositional forces \u2014 at once conventional and cutting edge, integrated and ad hoc, style obsessed and socially conscious, immersed in \u201coperational lore\u201d and deploying \u201capparent intelligence.\u201d And it was to the movement\u2019s concerted attempts to reconcile such seemingly irreconcilable qualities that Banham devoted much of his attention in his final years. Important differences between High Tech and the architecture examined in previous chapters also can be discerned. Alison and Peter Smithson frankly associated themselves with the New Brutalism as a specifically defined movement. The Archigram group similarly trumpeted their stylistic aims under broadly disseminated banners such as \u201cPlug in\u201d and \u201cZoom.\u201d By contrast, Foster, Rogers, Renzo Piano, and other architects associated with High Tech uniformly disdained the label, proclaiming allegiance not to a High Tech (or any other) aesthetic but rather to a properly modern ethic committed to the social lives of their buildings\u2019 inhabitants.4 The architecture advanced by these architects was a far cry from the burgeoning critical culture of postmodernism. As young pundits such as George Baird rejected prevailing notions of both \u201ctotal architecture\u201d and \u201clife conditioning\u201d in the late 1960s,5 High Tech architects appeared wholeheartedly to embrace both concepts and committed themselves not to theoretical posturing but rather to pragmatic issues of building organization and construction. Alison and Peter Smithson built only sporadically after 1970, and Archigram Architects did not complete a single building during their official association as a practice from 1970 to 1975. High Tech practitioners such as Foster and Rogers (at first together and later independently) and the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership, by contrast, saw buildings completed at a steady clip from the late 1960s. Even as the worldwide economic slump of the early 1970s had many architects seeking solace in academia and \u201cpaper architecture,\u201d High Tech architects remained doggedly committed to building. They managed to stay active by aligning with industrial clients and global corporations\u2014Herman Miller, IBM, Olivetti, and, later, international financial institutions such as Lloyd\u2019s of London and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank\u2014that were reviled by many as the very objects of the resurgent Marxist critique of capital that swept through architectural culture after 1968.6 Despite many of its architects\u2019 stated aversions to matters of style, High Tech sustained often harsh criticism for its alignment with modernist stylistic tropes, primarily from left leaning advocates of postmodern architecture.7 At the same time, conservative critics, including the Prince of Wales, railed against High Tech architects for what they saw as a lack of concern for building inhabitants and a lack of respect for historical contexts.8 And though Banham had forsaken the New Bru talism for its ultimate alignment with conventional aesthetics and had refrained from fully endorsing early clip on works such as the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership\u2019s Bathroom Tower and Stirling\u2019s Olivetti Training Center,9 he offered unwavering support to mature High Tech. To the end of his career, he maintained a commitment to High Tech\u2019s persistent modernism, which he saw as a potent alternative to rampant postmodernism. At the same time, he saw through High Tech\u2019s more conventional aspects to discern not the radical alterity he had previously sought in une architecture autre but rather the more nuanced qualities of an \u201cother\u201d tradition of modern architecture. The Roots of High Tech: Foster and Rogers Though its impact was global, High Tech was a particularly English innovation. Many of its early proponents were educated at the Architectural Association (AA) in the late 1950s and early \u201960s, when Banham, Price, and the Smithsons loomed large. Unlike their mentors, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers \u2014High Tech\u2019s two most significant English practitioners \u2014also enjoyed early firsthand exposure to American architecture. In 1961, Foster and Richard and Su Rogers left England to study at Yale University.10 There, under the tutelage of the demanding American dean Paul Rudolph, both were exposed to a brand of modern architecture less specifically functionalist than their AA training had been. Yale, at that time, was an incubator of the sort of postwar monumentality advanced by Sigfried Giedion and others in the 1940s,\" promoted in the pages of Perspecta: The Yale Architectural Journal in the 1950s, and found in built works by Rudolph, Eero Saarinen, and Louis Kahn in New Haven, Connecticut, and elsewhere from the 1940s into the 1970s. While Rudolph\u2019s Art and Architecture building would not be completed until 1963, after Foster and Rogers had departed, they enjoyed intimate contact with Kahn\u2019s work, as their studios were housed on the top floor of his University Art Gallery. Rogers\u2019s biographer, recounting an exchange between Rudolph and Rogers over the optimal depth of a sunken parking garage, elucidated the change in ideological tenor between London and New Haven. When Rogers \u201cargued from the standard AA position\u201d that \u201cfunctional requirements of the circulation of cars and pedestrians\u201d should determine the depth of the garage, Rudolph countered with his opinion that \u201ccar roofs looked pretty from above en masse,\u201d and that the correct depth would be determined by discerning how to afford pedestrians the best view.12 Such unashamedly visual criteria, as well as the grueling all night demands of Yale\u2019s studio culture, were anathema to the young Brits. As Rogers recounted, \u201cWe certainly learned to work extremely hard and to use our eyes, not an English tradition.\u201d13 At Yale, Foster and Rogers grew close to James Stirling, by then a regular visiting professor with whom they made frequent weekend trips to New York. They also studied with Serge Chermayeff, another European, who would take over Rudolph\u2019s role as dean of the school in 1962,14 and they met Craig Ellwood, one of the Case Study architects, who opened their eyes to architectural developments in California. After extensive travels across the United States to see the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Foster and the Rogerses found work in San Francisco \u2014Foster at the firm of Anshen and Allen; Richard Rogers at Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill; and Su Rogers at the Federal Housing Authority.15 While on the West Coast, they traveled to Los Angeles to see the work of Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Wright, as well as that of Charles and Ray Eames, Ellwood, and other Case Study architects. In a posthumously published essay, Banham outlined the depth of influence of the Case Study program on the development of High Tech.16 Known through John Entenza\u2019s Arts and Architecture magazine from the late 1940s, the work of Case Study architects, particularly that of the Eameses, was widely admired in England. \u201cThe appeal of the Case Study houses,\u201d Banham argued in an echo of his earlier characterizations of the New Brutalism, \u201clay in the way they reinforced the dogmas of honesty, clarity, and unity, the exposure of structure, the use of certifiably modern materials, and the absence of ornament,\u201d qualities Banham cited as \u201cthe moral truths\u201d of modern architecture.17 In the previous paragraph, Banham incorrectly derived \u201chonesty, clarity, and unity\u201d from an unsigned text likely written by Richard Lohse.18 The German original, as Banham noted, read \u201cKlarheit, Ehrlichkeit, Ein fachkeit,\u201d which should have led him to \u201cclarity, honesty, and simplicity,\u201d not \u201cunity\u201d (Einheit). Though Banham would make other errors in his late career translations from German, this substitution may have been intentional, as the valuation of unity over mere simplicity would prove crucial in his late writings. Beyond these orthodox characteristics, the new work in California also displayed \u201copen minded, experimental, hands on, improvisatory, quirky\u201d characteristics \u2014 in short, \u201cwit\u201d\u2014that offered \u201ca much needed antidote to the cut and dried recipes of routine modernism being taught in the schools.\u201d19 This unique ability to both maintain and challenge the status quo of European modernism caught the attention of London journals such as Architectural Design and the Architectural Review from the mid 1950s and, importantly, of Alison and Peter Smithson. While Foster was training at the much more traditional Manchester University, Richard Rogers was developing a close rapport with Peter Smithson at the AA. The older architect undoubtedly directed his student\u2019s attention to the Eameses\u2019 work. A few years later in California, Foster and Rogers were able to examine the Eames house in situ. Strongly contrasting the pristine details (and expense) of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s canonical projects in Chicago, the Eames House was straightforwardly assembled from low cost, off the shelf components such as industrial sash windows and standard steel sections (fig. 4 i) The house became something of a model for young English architects, and by the early 1960s, students at the AA were scouring the pages of Esther McCoy\u2019s Modern California Houses,20 paying particular attention to the work of the Eameses, Ellwood, and Raphael Soriano, architects whose \u201crelaxed alternative usage\u201d of the modern vocabulary they found to be \u201ca liberating revelation.\u201d21 Much of that relaxed usage was to be found in the detailing, particularly in welded steel connections. The possibilities of welded joints were well known to midcentury architects worldwide through Mies van der Rohe\u2019s famous Farnsworth House (1951) (fig. 4.2). There, Mies erased all trace of assembly by specifying plug welds, a meticulous and expensive process that belies the painstaking handicraft fig. 4.1 Charles Eames (American, 1907 78) and Ray Eames (American, 1912 88).

Michael Cadwell described the implications of the process: \u201cEach operation disappears with the next. The mechanical craft of the seated connection disappears with the industrial craft of welding, the industrial craft of welding disappears with the handicraft of sanding, and the handicraft of sanding disappears with its own operation. There is no glorification of technology in this curious sequence, just as there is no remnant of craft.\u201d22 Such elegant erasures, though essential to the ethereal abstraction of Mies\u2019s domestic masterpiece, were far too expensive for more quotidian applications. Bolted connections, which frankly display the mechanical processes of their assembly, remain the norm, and welds, when employed, usually remain visible as the welder left them. Of course, connections of any sort, while necessary, are expensive; limiting their number and complexity is essential to cost effective building. In the 1950s, English architects had approached the problem with prefabricated building systems such as the one developed by the Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme (CLASP). From 1957, the consortium elaborated a system for steel frame buildings constructed using standard details and components assembled according to a preestablished dimensional system. The results were at least superficially convincing\u2014a CLASP school was premiated at the i960 Milan Tri ennale \u2014 but, as Banham pointed out in 1962, the system met with harsh criticism from the architectural community in its early years. Its details were assumed, often sight unseen, to be \u201cawful,\u201d and the resulting buildings were deemed \u201cnot architecture.\u201d23 The construction detail was (and for most architects remains) understood as the locus of disciplinary intensity, the moment at which mere building is transcended to become architecture. Honest, compelling details were embedded deeply in the ideology of the modern movement and aligned tightly with its ethical mission. Mies, recall, purportedly found God in them. Grappling with details was (and is) regarded as the truest test of one\u2019s architectural mettle, their successful solution key to a work\u2019s ability to compel conviction. Such attitudes find their roots deep in architecture\u2019s \u201coperational lore\u201d and may be traced back through eighteenth and nineteenth century theorists such as Marc Antoine Laugier and Gottfried Semper to the field\u2019s mythical origins.24 Details such as those developed by CLASP, which were procured \"ex catalog\u201d and applied without effort, appeared to sidestep the activity that defined the architect as a professional and architecture as a discipline.25 Trained to execute and appreciate complex, custom, and exacting solutions, Foster and Rogers were conditioned to be wary of shortcut solutions such as CLASP, and they were understandably astonished by the California architects\u2019 achievement, in contrast to Mies\u2019s spiritual and astringent \u201cless is more,\u201d of a casual and relaxed delivery of more with less. By combining Klarheit, Ehrlichkeit, and Einfachkeit with \u201cWit, Too,\u201d the title of Banham\u2019s essay on the Case Study architects captured the orthodox values of Foster\u2019s and Rogers\u2019s European training as well as the playful quality with which it had been tempered in America. It should be noted that much of that wit was, as Michael Brawne observed, \u201clargely the result of the additive process, of the seemingly casual juxtaposition of different elements\u201d in the Eames House.26 While Banham (and Brawne) chose to link this combinatorial wit to American sources, the method\u2019s distinctly English characteristics should not pass unmentioned. Substantial wit, also derived from the juxtaposition of elements, was baldly on display in Stirling and Gowan\u2019s celebrated Leicester University Engineering Building (1959), which Foster and Rogers would have known well. A few years earlier, Nikolaus Pevsner had outlined similar compositional tendencies, if less overt wittiness, as endemic to the English national character. Discussing the idiosyncrasies of English Perpendicular Gothic, Pevsner noted the peculiar boxiness of its forms. Typical \u201csquare ended chancels,\u201d he submitted, would be \u201cvery unusual in France and Germany. They prefer the rounded end with or without a passageway like an aisle around\u2014what we call an ambulatory. This gives a sense of moulded space, of plasticity, of pulling together.\u201d Continuing, he pointed out the English alternative\u2019s lack of such integrated unity: \u201cEngland prefers that the walls should meet at right angles and remain separate from each other and that the enclosed spaces should be a box, a cube, or a block.... Part is added to part instead of the sculptural pulling together in France, where transepts get short and keep close to the unified composition of the center.\u201d27 Thus, to embrace the Eameses\u2019 ad hoc Americanisms was unwittingly (pardon the pun) to realign oneself with exactly the provincial qualities of Englishness that Banham \u2014and the young modernists he had influenced with his aggressive early writings \u2014had rejected as complicit with the nostalgic propositions of Townscape and the Festival of Britain.28 Whether or not they were fully aware of them, such were the disciplinary complexities at play when Foster and the Rogerses returned to London in 1963 to join with the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman (the latter of whom Foster would later marry) and launch their independent practice, Team 4. Team 4 Early Team 4 commissions included the house at Murray Mews (London, 1965) and the Creek Vean House (Cornwall, 1966), which were completed in traditional materials such as brick and concrete block. While their futuristic, cockpit like Retreat at Pill Creek (Cornwall, 1964) foreshadowed the High Tech aesthetic the two architects would later pursue in earnest, none of these projects emulates the relaxed disposition and lightweight materials of the Case Study architects.

Mews recalled the austere early offerings of the Smithsons, and the Creek Vean House showed affinities to the domestic work of Frank Lloyd Wright.29 Despite these differences, each project employed crisp angular geometries and generous expanses of glass. Glass roofs were detailed in the manner of greenhouse construction at Murray Mews and sealed with more expensive neoprene gaskets at the two Cornwall projects. Murray Mews was plagued with incessant leaks, and all three projects suffered from the difficulty of traditional construction techniques (and construction crews) to deliver the meticulous precision demanded by their architects. With the Reliance Controls Building (figs. 4.3, 4.4; see figs. 4.6 4.9, pi. 11), the young architects abandoned the inherent crudeness of traditional materials and methods to embrace the lightweight steel construction and programmatic openness at which they had marveled in Southern California. The project, which came to Team 4 on the recommendation of James Stirling, called for 3,200 square meters of space to accommodate both the assembly and management facilities for an electronics manufacturer. Laid out on a twelve meter square grid, the project was enclosed on three sides with the same corrugated metal decking that formed the roof. The fourth side was fully glazed and intended to allow easy future expansion to the north.30 All cladding was positioned inboard of the perimeter structure, foregrounding the stark white structural steel against subdued gray siding. A symmetrical street elevation comprised five windowless bays, each crossed by diagonal bracing. At the central bay, where a Yale trained American modernist (or a Wittkower reading English one) might be expected to locate the main entrance, the young architects cheekily placed a mechanical exhaust flue and a cubic water tower as an \u201chomage\u201d to the Smithsons\u2019 Hunstanton School (see figs. 4 3, tio).31 The main entry was located around the corner, the lone asymmetrical feature on an otherwise rigidly symmetrical west elevation. The subversion of convention at the entry would return in later projects by Rogers and Foster alike.32 The centralized exhaust flue marked the presence of an invisible yet crucial element to the scheme \u2014 a service passage running beneath the ground slab along the central north south axis of the building. From here, mechanical and electrical services (including hot water pipes to feed the radiant heating system embedded in the slab) were distributed, while ample space was left for maintenance and the provision of additional service runs to accommodate future expansion. Organized in this manner, the project resonates with the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast (see figs. 3.6, 3.7), which Banham soon would celebrate in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment; the \u201cendless and indeterminate\u201d projects of Albert Kahn and John Weeks, which Banham had presented in \u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d; and, more emphatically, with the California houses designed by Anshen and Allen for developer Joseph Eichler from the 1950s, which Foster undoubtedly would have encountered during his tenure with the firm. Reliance Controls\u2019 planned internal atria, opaque street facade, glazed rear facade, frankly exposed structure, curiously extended roof beams, and radiant heating all echo the vocabulary of Eichler homes (fig 4 5) A. Quincy Jones\u2019s widely published steel framed X 100 house, which Eichler commissioned and built near San Francisco in 1956, also appears to be an important precedent, particularly for its exposed steel framing and roof deck. Baldly emulating another California precedent, Ezra Ehrenkrantz\u2019s School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) school prototypes of 1961 63, Team 4 illustrated their integrated approach to structure and services in an oft republished series of cutaway perspectival sections (fig. 4 6).33 fig. 4.6 Team 4 (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935; Wendy Foster [nee Cheesman], British, d. 1989; Richard Rogers, British, b. Italy, 1933; Su Rogers [nee Brumwell], b. 1939). Reliance Controls Building (Swindon, England, 1967). Section perspectives. Like its entry, the floor plan at Reliance Controls does not resonate with the building s rigid structural and mechanical organization. In keeping with the architects interest in promoting a nonhierarchical \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d in which blue and white collar workers were treated equally, programmatic elements were loosely organized within the regular grid.34 Lightweight partitions were designed for easy reconfiguration, entry and dining facilities were shared by all workers, and liberal amounts of glass maintained visual continuity between office and assembly areas. Both architects would continue to advance such open, flexible planning in subsequent projects. With these features, Reliance Controls not only swerved away from the \u201cmassy, sculptural east coast approach of Rudolph and Chermayeff\u201d35 but also diverged sharply from the rigid, classicized plans of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s midcentury projects in Chicago. Yet, in its fastidious detailing, the work did not quite achieve the fabled casualness of Southern California. At Reliance, twenty one inch deep steel beams sit atop eight by eight inch columns, with eight by eight inch purlins resting on the beams. The symmetrical proportion of the purlins is conspicuously inefficient, but it exactly matched the width of both the columns and beams below (figs. 4.7, 4.8). Prior to delivery to the site, crosshead sections of the beams and purlins \u2014 the beams cantilevered one and a half meters beyond the column centerlines; the purlins, eighteen inches\u2014were welded to the columns, with shop welded gussets reinforcing their webs. Aligned with the flanges of the columns below, the gussets FiG. 4.7 Team 4 (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935; Wendy Foster [nee Cheesman], British, d. 1989; Richard Rogers, British, b.

Section detail. gave the impression that the columns continued uninterrupted through the beams above.36 After these prewelded assemblies were erected on site, beams were temporarily bolted in place to fill the gaps between the crossheads and additional purlins arranged over the beams at three meters on center. As at the Farnsworth House, these connections were then field welded, the temporary bolts were removed, and all surfaces were ground smooth. Intimating that even the Case Study architects were in fact something less than casual, Banham noted that such details display \u201cdistinctly Ellwoodian\u201d tendencies, which he illustrated with two large photographs of the mannered column to truss connections at Ellwood\u2019s Scientific Data Systems Plant in El Segundo, California (1966).37 Ellwood\u2019s columns, cruciform in plan, were built up from standard W sections; his trusses were assembled from custom welded square steel tubes and angles. Steel gussets were added throughout to give rectilinear closure to standard steel shapes. In their fastidious combination of standard elements with labor intensive handicraft, they foreshadow the built up cruciform columns Mies van der Rohe would use at the New National Gallery in Berlin (1969), and they make the adjective casual somewhat difficult to pronounce. Each case demonstrated the familiar story of an architect\u2019s stubborn ambition to wring aesthetic sophistication from the limited vocabulary of industrial construction, even at the cost of significant additional complexity, material, and labor. Contradictions such as these abounded at Reliance. Much has been made, for example, of the project\u2019s diagonal bracing on all four sides, even though it was required on only two. Like the redundant gusset plates and overly wide roof purlins deployed to maintain the continuous lines of the structural frame, the bracing betrayed Foster and Rogers\u2019s visual agenda.38 Again, Banham noted that such embellishment of structural necessity for aesthetic reasons could be found in Southern California: \u201cIn [the diagonal bracing\u2019s] ultimate source, the Eames house, all the diagonal bracing were unnecessary in the opinion of the engineers and survived into the built design only because Charles Eames wanted to keep them!\u201d39 Unlike his later imitators, Mies distilled the structure of the Farnsworth House to a spare minimalism. The plug welded connections erased not only the traditional tectonic affiliations to handicraft at the interface between the exposed steel columns and beams but also, owing to the rigid connections throughout, the need for diagonal bracing. Such details, as Cadwell observed, cause the house to \u201capproach the laconic splendor of a line drawing. Specifically, it is perspective drawing that erases any distraction from the persistent thrust of its projecting lines so that the play of house and landscape can unfold unfettered.\u201d40 Like the Farnsworth House, the Reliance Controls Building betrayed a desire by its architects to achieve the abstract quality of an architectural drawing. But here, the ambition was not Mies\u2019s confrontation of interior and landscape through the pervasive distillation of the architecture from physical form to abstract line. Instead, Team 4 amplified the tension between \u201cthe persistent thrust of its projecting lines\u201d and the \u201cdistractions\u201d caused by the details. Where Mies\u2019s details disappear in the act of construction, the complex connections at Reliance demanded expert scrutiny, a level of attentiveness typically instilled in architects as they master the painstaking act of preparing construction drawings. Notice the overhanging beam ends on the east and west facades (see fig. 4.4). These superfluous projections were the same cantilevered cross heads deployed at every column in the building. They signaled the redundancy of standard components and implied the potential extensibility of the project as demanded by the program brief. Nonetheless, budget conscious purists rightly have questioned their inclusion. Steel in building construction is purchased by weight, and eliminating them would have trimmed approximately 2,700 pounds of it from the project.41 This represented an insignificant overall savings, but given that Foster later \u201chad the temerity to answer Buckminster Fuller\u2019s non rhetorical question \u2018But what does your house weigh?\u2019 with a detailed weight breakdown of the Sainsbury Centre,\u201d42 the extensions have proven troublesome for later apologists. Rowan Moore, in an otherwise hagiographic treatment, admitted that the extensions were \u201cself conscious, even expressionist.\u201d43 Bryan Appleyard offered the even more understated observation that \u201cthe detailing is evidently chosen for reasons other than merely functional.\u201d44 Whether or not they signaled a lapse in ideological rigor, the beam ends sponsored a series of highly specific effects that rippled through the building. Observe that they project perpendicular to the axis of extension suggested by both the subgrade mechanical trunk and the north south orientation of the property. At the north facade, in the direction in which extension was possible, the purlins were composed in a friezelike detail far more indicative of classical closure than indefinite extensibility (see pi. ii).4s Given the symmetrical column grid of the building, it should not have been an issue to rotate the structure 90 degrees to make five of the offending beam ends usable in a future extension, but this drastically would have altered the perspectival effects within. As constructed, the purlins were oriented in the extensible direction and are made visually discontinuous by the regular intersections of the larger, lower beams. The tight corrugations of the roof decking and the fluorescent lights seated in them also ran counter to the axis and worked with the primary beams subtly to compartmentalize the interior into layered cross axial strips. Coupled with the emphatic X patterns inscribed across the north facing windows, the elements conspired to impede, rather than encourage, a smooth visual connection between interior and exterior. Where Mies\u2019s detailing collapsed landscape and interiors together at the expense of the structure\u2019s physicality, Team 4\u2019s tectonic articulation placed their architecture emphatically in between. As the building was demolished in 1991, the effect is best seen in Foster\u2019s meticulous renderings, which, with one exception, represent the space in one point perspective along the main axis (fig. 4.9). Photographers, as evidenced in nearly every published image of the project, routinely oriented their cameras perpendicular to this axis within the lateral slots of space, thus exaggerating the perspectival recession Team 4 apparently aimed to suppress. Given Banham\u2019s indictments against the aesthetic preoccupations of the Smith sons and their allies (The New Brutalism had been published just one year previously), one might expect him to have had little patience for the similar pretensions on display at Reliance. And, indeed, he would not comment on the project or its architects for five years. For Banham, this was the era of \u201cFlatscape with Containers\u201d (1967), The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment (1969), and Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971)\u2014works that sternly took issue with architecture\u2019s status quo. But as the 1970s unfolded, the disciplinary mainstream moved steadily away from modern movement values toward ecological, linguistic, and postmodern concerns. In response, Banham softened his dogged criticism of canonical modern architecture and turned his attention toward the work of a dwindling number of adherents \u2014 Foster, Rogers, and Renzo Piano among them \u2014 who operated not outside the ken of the modern movement but rather in what remained of its very core. Mainstream modern architecture, once the motivation to seek an \u201cother\u201d architecture, had become the most promising source of its eventual delivery. fig. 4.9 Team 4 (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935; Wendy Foster [nee Cheesman], British, d. 1989; Richard Rogers, British, b. Italy, 1933; Su Rogers [nee Brumwell], b. 1939) Reliance Controls Building (Swindon, England, 1967). Interior perspective of early scheme. Appropriate Tech Banham\u2019s polemical writings of the 1950s and \u201960s had been sharply critical of orthodox modern architecture. Many took his vociferous attacks on the movement\u2019s more damning contradictions (particularly those that kept an architecture of technologically enhanced performance hamstrung by an allegiance to outmoded compositional tropes) to be an indictment of modern architecture as a whole.46 Yet Banham\u2019s texts operated consistently as a corrective to, rather than a condemnation of, modern architecture. Banham\u2019s earlier essays were written at a time when modern architecture and the disciplinary establishment were closely aligned and thus easily conflated. In later works, however, as the establishment began to shift away from modernist values, the distinctions came into sharper relief, and Banham\u2019s consistent support of modern architecture became clearer. At the same time, his desire for coherent imagery and his simultaneous commitment to technology that seemed to ensure invisibility remained intact, suffusing his late writings with a distinct tension with which he would grapple throughout his final years. Banham\u2019s texts on Norman Foster, the first of which appeared in 1972, demonstrate both the establishment\u2019s changing attitudes toward modern architecture and Banham\u2019s consistently critical attitudes toward that establishment. In them, Banham focused on the persistent modernist tendencies on display in the work, in particular Foster\u2019s deft accommodation of complex programs with lightweight materials and his Miesian distillation of industrial materials into ephemeral, abstract forms. These qualities offered Banham ample opportunity not only to harden his position with respect to modern architecture but also to highlight, often with mischievous relish, damning contradictions in the positions advanced by establishment institutions, such as the Royal Academy of Art and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and mainstream publications, such as the RIBA Journal, the Architects\u2019Journal, and his former employer, the Architectural Review. In 1972, Foster\u2019s IBM Pilot Head Office Building (Hampshire, 1971) received an award from the Rl BA.47 Contrasting Reliance Controls, where a meticulously detailed steel frame was monumentalized inside and out, here an uninflected glass envelope offered scant indication of the particularities of structure from outside, while a suspended ceiling discretely masked the structural and mechanical elements within (see pi. 12). In the same issue of the RIBA Journal that published Foster\u2019s winning scheme, RIBA president Alex Gordon announced the \"long life/loose fit/low energy study,\u201d a new program aimed at engaging environmental issues.48 Curiously, the study\u2019s ultimate model for environmentally sensitive construction was not an example from the modern canon but was instead the traditional Georgian terrace house. At first glance, the IBM building does appear less than energy efficient. In the same month that the award was announced in the RIBA Journal, the project\u2019s minimal exterior details\u2014neoprene gaskets and thin glazing bars between twelve foot tall glass panes and an equally spare cap flashing concealing the junction at the roof\u2014were published in the Architects\u2019 Journal.49 While many were taken in by the building\u2019s restrained elegance, one reader feared the lack of insulation at the coping would lead to condensation and the eventual degradation of the building envelope. Loren Butt, Foster\u2019s mechanical engineer and future partner, responded by noting that the circulation of conditioned air through the space eliminated the condensation problem.50 This prompted Astragal, the anonymous critical pundit whose weekly column ran in the Architects\u2019 Journal, to attack the project for reliance on round the clock air conditioning. \u201cThe process,\u201d he opined, \u201ccan only be extremely wasteful. Foster might now turn his back on lightweights and try to design heavy buildings which have many advantages\u2014including an inbuilt resistance to condensation.\u201d51 Banham entered the fray the following November. He countered Astragal and the RIBA\u2019s automatic embrace of heavy masonry construction by pointing out the propensity for condensation and mold in traditional \u201cGlasgow tenements\u201d and modern \u201ctower blocks\u201d alike.52 And, as round the clock air conditioning was required at IBM to cool the computers it housed, why not, Banham challenged, \u201ctake better advantage of the energy that\u2019s got be used anyhow?\u201d He went on to criticize each of the tenets of the LL/LF/LE approach. Long Life, he opined, seemed predisposed to litter the landscape with out of date buildings at exactly the time that land shortages seemed to call for more frequent building replacement. The Loose Fit of the Georgian terrace house, while mitigating some of the LL issues, appeared to him ill equipped to accommodate many programs. And finally, LF seemed to undermine the Low Energy ambition, a condition he saw in the Architectural Association\u2019s lecture space, which required \"a startling amount of electric lights and similar gadgetry\u201d to be loosely fit into the Georgian terrace houses at Bedford Square.53 Instead of the blunt partisanship of LL/LF/LE, Banham advocated a studied, case by case approach, which conveniently came down on the side of Short Life/Tight Fit/High Energy and indicated his own preferences even as he endeavored to give a fairer account of the problem at hand. For Banham, the RIBA\u2019s LL/LF/LE study was nothing more than a partisan retrenchment in traditional design; it was less concerned with the sober analysis of the problems of environmental management than with positioning a preselected, neo Georgian solution. And the group\u2019s inherent contradictions, which foreclosed design tactics that might combine traditional and modern methods, were too damaging to be left unchallenged. Foster would offer exactly such a combination of modern and traditional methods in his 1974 Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters in Ipswich (fig. 4.10; see figs. 7.1 7.4, pis. 18 20). Clad in a glass skin even more minimal than IBM\u2019s, the project drew immediate comparisons to \u201cgeneric modern\u201d designs.54 Yet, unlike the suburban fig. 4.10 Foster Associates (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935). Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters (Ipswich, England, 1974). Aerial view. Photo by Mike Page. boxes at Reliance Controls and IBM, Willis Faber was set down in the heart of a vibrant urban context. In addition, the project eschewed the simple rectilinearity of the earlier works to offer an undulating plan that dutifully follows the irregular curves of the site. Further complicating matters, Foster capped the building with a turf roof. Banham\u2019s reaction is telling. Again, he challenged the opinions of the establishment (in this case, the editors of the Architectural Review). But rather than focus on details and performance, he made his case in terms of aesthetics. In using the uninflected glass skin, he claimed, the project seemed to adhere to familiar modern conventions. But with its irregular, site derived massing, the project seems less beholden to the strictures of modern architecture than to the neopicturesque sequences of Townscape.S5 According to the partisan logic of the day, Banham opined, abstract glass boxes were associated with an indifferent modern architecture that flagrantly consumed scarce energy resources, while looser shapes were associated with \u201cthe Contextual, \u2018herbivore\u2019 approach\u201d that had come to be associated with energy conservation. But, as Banham pointed out, the deep floor plates at Willis Faber provided an energy efficient ratio between enclosing glass and enclosed volume, while the turf roof offered ample insulation. He delighted in this incongruous combination of high modernism and low vernacular: \u201cturf on top of a high technology building full of air conditioning, escalators, computers, and stuff? Once again, separate expectations, different architectural languages, have been shotgun married without apology or regard for the niceties of academic discourse.\u201d Much of his pleasure stemmed from the inherent orthodoxy of this apparently ad hoc solution. It was none other than \u201cthe true and onlie begetter of the universal, damn local traditions, glassskinned, pure rectangular office block, Le Corbusier himself,\u201d he explained, who had \u201creminded the present century of the roofing virtues of growing turf.\u201d56 Banham then turned his sights on his former employers at the Architectural Review, whose criticism of the building he found \u201ccontemptible.\u201d Finding little to fault in the building as designed, the editors proposed the possibility of two such buildings: \u201cOne Willis Faber and Dumas building may be a revelation, but two facing one another make a prison.\u201d57 For Banham, this was too much. \u201cCome off it!\u201d he retorted, before delivering his stern conclusion: Two such facades facing one another would not (just) reflect a lack of crafts manly detail on both sides of the street but also\u2014as in all facing mirror situations\u2014the viewer repeated to infinity in both directions. Not only does this flatter the viewer, but it is a form of ego massage which the editors of the Architectural Review enjoy all over their editorial offices every day of the work week, for their premises are notoriously the most bemirrored in the business. Perhaps they\u2019re just jealous. Perhaps it is not flattering to see a bankrupt ideological position reflected to infinity. Perhaps they should put turf on their heads and see if that looks any better.58 Banham regularly combined such careful observation of architectural facts with cheeky criticism of establishment positions in his contributions to New Society.59 A more serious tone can be found in a 1979 treatment of Foster\u2019s work in which Banham made a forceful case for the persistence of modern architecture. He opened with a succinct statement of the contemporary condition, which doubled as a tacit response to Charles Jencks, whose Language of Post Modern Architecture was enjoying a successful reception at the time: The collapse of the Modern Movement, when it finally happened, proved not to be as much fun as had been anticipated. The brave new post modern world of stylistic pluralism, popular participation, architecture for its own sake, and all the rest of it, coincided with an economic recession that left the new avant/ arriere garde impotent to build. Even so, the most galling aspect of their unrealized millennium must be that \u201cthat old modern architecture\u201d survived as the dominant element in the new pluralism, is still producing the best buildings that are actually being built in Europe and North America, and is building them with its mythologies (social, economic, technological) still intact.60 fig. 4 ii Foster Associates (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935).

The essay moves through themes already examined in his earlier treatments of IBM and Willis Faber, including environmental performance, lightweight materials, vernacular sources, the role of style, and relationships to vernacular traditions. Though he considered Foster\u2019s work \u201crecognizably stylish,\u201d Banham found it was governed not by a particular style or ideology but rather by a consistent attitude toward details and a \u201cseries of master concepts\u201d deployed through lightweight materials. Neither high nor low tech, Foster employed what Banham refers to as \u201cappropriate technology\u201d fitted to the task at hand. This method set Foster apart from both \u201csimple mindedly low tech\u201d and \u201cwoolly minded high tech\u201d architects and aligned him with the pragmatic ad hoc approach Banham so often championed. For where both low and high tech architects had developed discernible iconographic signals of their ideological allegiances (\u201cwindmills and pise walls\u201d for the former, \u201chighly coloured exposed duct work\u201d for the latter), Foster's \u2018\u201cappropriate tech\u2019 must have whatever is usefully at hand, whatever it may be.\u201d61 Thus, like Buckminster Fuller and Willis Carrier before him, Foster was presented as a boffin designer who solved problems as they came by the best means available. Banham went on to praise Foster\u2019s unexaggerated offerings at Willis Faber and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts (fig. 411). And though Foster offered \u201ceveryday ubiquitous, nine to five proof that Modern Architecture Lives \u2014and thrives,\u201d it was Foster\u2019s former partner Richard Rogers, in collaboration with Renzo Piano, who offered \u201cthe only monumental building of consequence to go up in Europe in the 1970s\u201d: the celebrated Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.62 Willis Faber and the Sainsbury Centre, like Foster\u2019s earlier IBM building, each advanced an astringent and ephemeral form of modern architecture that approached invisibility. And while these restrained buildings might stand as appropriate models for \u201cnine to five\u201d practice, it was Piano + Rogers\u2019s monumental work at the Plateau Beaubourg that, for Banham, best demonstrated the enduring efficacy of modern architecture. triGH,Vc H AND THE PERSISTENCE OF MODERNISM Monumental Tech A year before the project\u2019s completion, Banham provided an important examination of Centre Pompidou (figs. 4.12 4.14; see pi. 13) in Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (1976). In his assessment, the megastructure movement owed much to Archigram projects such as Peter Cook\u2019s Plug In City, and, with many representative projects in the movement adopting an aesthetic of rough concrete frames infilled with fine grain and apparently (if not often actually) interchangeable pieces, it also seemed to absorb many of the qualities associated with the New Brutalism.63 Banham\u2019s treatment of projects by the Archigram group and others in that book are dealt with in a later chapter. At this point in the narrative, it will suffice to point out that Centre Pompidou\u2019s boldly exposed structure and mechanical equipment were rendered in the bright hues typical of Archigram projects, and that the project bore a strong resemblance to the radical proposals of the 1960s.64 Though Banham found it to be \u201ca shade less adventurous than the Fun Palace\u201d and \u201cfar less freeform and participatory\u201d than Constant Nieuwenhuys\u2019s New Babylon,65 it secured its place as the culmination of the megastructure movement through its remarkable visual imagery. As he put it, Centre Pompidou \u201cwill be perceived to be a megastructure [because] it answers the ultimate acid test of looking like one.\u201d66 For Banham, such strong visual qualities were crucial to the megastructure movement. These were \u201cmainly...architectural perceptions,\u201d and megastructure, in the end, was fundamentally an architectural problem. The movement\u2019s development and ultimate rejection in the wake of 1968, he surmised, did not result from outside forces (whether social, political, or economic) but rather from forces internal to the discipline. Indeed, it appeared to have succumbed to exactly the criticism George Baird had leveled at Eero Saarinen and Cedric Price in 1966.67 Like Saarinen at CBS, megastructure offered a coherent body of imagery. At the same time, it promised personal freedom and functional flexibility on the order of Price\u2019s fig. 4.13 Piano + Rogers (Renzo Piano, Italian, b. 1937; Richard Rogers, British, b. Italy, 1933) Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris, 1977). Section detail. fig. 4.14 Piano + Rogers (Renzo Piano, Italian, b. 1937; Richard Rogers, British, b.

This dual ambition laid bare a core paradox. To promise freedom, megastructure needed a legible image, which required a high degree of architectural control. To deliver that freedom, megastructure needed to relinquish control, which necessarily compromised the efficacy of its image. Megastructure,\u201d Banham concluded, \u201cproved to be a self cancelling concept. Nonetheless, Banham predicted Centre Pompidou would be a \u201cunique achievement the only realized monument to some of the best aspirations and most cherished ambitions of the architectural generation to which Piano + Rogers belong\u2014well serviced, adaptable, immensely stylish, an architecture whose main aesthetic virtues will be seen in its performance.\u201d69 Of course, the values he described here were as much his own as anyone\u2019s. This fact surely accounts for the pathos that colors Ban ham\u2019s writings of the mid 1970s and 80s, which were published as those values saw decreasing efficacy in global architectural culture. It also helps to explain Banham\u2019s slow shift from aggressive critic of the modern establishment in the 1950s and \u201960s to one of modern architecture\u2019s most dependable apologist in the 1970s and \u201980s. Centre Pompidou opened to the public on 31 January 1977. In May of that year, the Architectural Review dedicated its cover and twenty four pages to the project, with Banham providing the critical commentary. In a short editorial, the Review\u2019s editors described \u201ca menacing building which stands like a man in full armour in a room full of civilians\u201d before arriving at a familiar conclusion: \u201cOne Centre Pompidou (like one Faber Dumas in Ipswich) is an exhilarating sight; but only contemplate what the centers of our cities would be like if they were chiefly composed of buildings of this kind and you will see what a repellant fix we could be in.\u201d The text continued with a dismissal of exactly what Banham had celebrated in the design a year earlier: The Centre reflects the supreme moment of technological euphoria in Western society: the moment when we genuinely believed that \u201cfreedom\u201d was to be got by providing ourselves with endless power supplied facility: with servicing which would be so elaborate and so heavily duplicated that you could do anything you want, any where, at any time. We are wiser now; for we know that even if our resources allowed this sort of indulgence, the political machinery we would have to forge to operate it would be so offensive that it would remove true freedom from the face of the earth. This is why there is no reason to expect a multiplicity of Pompidou like buildings; and why there is no call to agonize too much about the political implications of such a structure.70 The Review\u2019s admonitions might as well have been directed at Banham himself. For over a decade, Banham had been advocating technologically assisted anywhere/ anytime freedom, and had been heaping scorn on establishment pundits who had turned their backs on such ambitions. His Review essay holds true to form. Rather than characterize the building as the end of the line (as he had done in Megastructure\u2019s melancholy conclusion), he read it as the basis of a resurgent modern architecture that \u201cseems to have taken its revenge on two generations of academic doubters, intellectual Luddites, and all those energetic breast beaters who nowadays contribute to the comic pages at the beginning of the AR.\u201d71 Banham\u2019s arguments were particularly cunning. Adhering to a pattern he would follow often in his late career writing, he linked Pompidou tightly to the founding ambitions of the modern movement. But in tracing a genealogy somewhat different from the typical path trod by adherents of the International Style, Banham crafted a version of modern architecture that cleaved much more closely to the aspirations and ambitions of the radical works he had advocated in the 1960s. His argument turned around the question of monumentality, in particular the version of it advanced by Sigfried Giedion, Fernand Leger, and Jose Luis Sert in their influential essay \u201cNine Points on Monumentality.\u201d Though Giedion had been a stern critic of Archigram and their contemporaries,72 his 1943 program for monumentality eerily resonated with Centre Pompidou: \u201cModern materials and new techniques are at hand: light metal structures; curved, laminated wood arches; panels of different textures, colors, and sizes; light elements like ceiling which can be suspended from big trusses covering practically unlimited spans.\u201d73 This, Banham was quick to point out, was not the sort of monumentality that was typically associated with modern architecture in the 1970s, a situation he blamed on Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cincreasingly geriatric understanding of monumentality as mere mass and impenetrable substance.\u201d While Banham provides a judicious caveat,74 the point was clear: Piano + Rogers\u2019s was \u201ca vision that is quintessential to the Modern Movement.\u201d Turning his attention to Pompidou\u2019s relation to megastructure, Banham again distanced the facility\u2019s lightweight flexibility from the brooding concrete of other constructed megastructures such as Geoffrey Copcutt\u2019s Cumbernauld Town Center (1960). And, in a shotgun wedding that can only be seen as shocking, Banham joined Giedion and Archigram with a separatrix in support of 1960s ambitions: \u201cWhat sets it [Centre Pompidou] apart from Cumbernauld, however, is its aesthetic\u2014 Geoffrey Copcutt\u2019s design, however brilliant, was lumbered (willingly, no doubt) with that ponderous Corbusian monumentality of mere mass, whereas Pompidou\u2019s Giedion/Archigram transparency and color seem even truer nowadays to the departed aspirations of \u2018the swinging \u201960s.\u2019\u201d75 Having linked Pompidou and Archigram through Giedion to core modern movement values (and nudged Le Corbusier away from them in the process), Banham turned his sights toward more recent impediments to the resurgence of the movement. And like his enlisting of Giedion to his cause, his use of the Centre Pompidou\u2019s brash assemblage of mechanistic parts to take a critical swing at Charles Jencks\u2019s concept of adhocism is at first blush counterintuitive. His point turned about the detailing of the Pompidou\u2019s glazed enclosure. In the original design, as in the constructed building, mechanical equipment and structural steel were held outside of the glass facades or above the ceilings to provide maximum interior flexibility (see fig. 4.13). While Banham appeared somewhat less than convinced by the complexity of the building\u2019s structure, he was blunt in his criticism of modifications to the glass skin required to meet city fire regulations. The original design called for a smooth envelope of curtain wall glazing slipped behind the main exterior columns. In the final scheme, opaque panels of heat resistant material were required to be added at each column as well as across the upper portion of the glazing at each floor level (see fig. 4.14). A battery of fire sprinklers and emergency shutters also were added. For Banham, these late additions conspired to ruin the pristine skin promised by the original design.76 His disapproval was unequivocal: \u201cI find myself stunned that a design team that had poured so much inventiveness into setting up that very pure concept in the first place, should allow it to be ad hocked to pieces in the last resort.\u201d Banham pursued this admonition more broadly in the next section: \u201cAd hocism, of course, is somewhat in fashion at present, and will always have a big place in the art of design, but its visible presence at Pompidou is curiously disturbing. It is conspicuously inappropriate to a design which otherwise has avoided manifest compromise.\u201d77 These are strange lines to come from the author of \u201cA Clip On Architecture.\u201d Indeed, the ad hoc assembly of elements also had been in fashion in the 1960s, and much of the most celebrated work of the period was characterized by the expedient combination of dissonant parts. Of course, Banham had an ambivalent relationship to such tactics even then, and he was always careful to differentiate between visual and programmatic dissonance. Observe his careful early description of Piano + Rogers\u2019s second scheme for Pompidou, which \u201ccomes closer to Plug In City in its visible open frames, with communications etc. threaded through them, and even more so in the graphic detailing and the ad hoc transient function implications of the very large presentation drawings that were made for it.\u201d78 Notice that only the \u201ctransient function implications\u201d are described as ad hoc. The \u201cgraphic detailing,\u201d consistent with Archigram\u2019s own, proved to be fastidious, precise, and carefully coordinated. Banham was quick to celebrate immersive milieus such as the Plateau Beau bourg. Recall, for example, his vivid descriptions of a near future Paris, in which highway convenience and the urbanity of Gigi were combined on the Champs Elysees;79 the Fun Palace, in which a \u201cmechanized shrine to Homo Ludens\u201d accommodated \u201cpolitical rallies...Greco Roman wrestling, table tennis, choral song, dervish dancing, model drag racing or just goofing and falling about\u201d;80 Archigram\u2019s drawings, in which \u201cdolly girls\u201d twist[ed] and \u201cfrug[ged],\u201d families promenaded, children danced, and crowds surged;81 and the un house, in which Dionne Warwick sang, protein turned, and cocktails poured in the mechanically enhanced comfort of the great outdoors.82 Banham delivered some of his most lyrical passages as vibrant carnivals of images and activities held in unlikely proximity by little more than serial commas. Of course, those commas were crucial. Though he often peppered his sentences with neologisms and custom hyphenated constructions, Banham always respected the grammatical conventions of English usage. Consistently lucid and often exuberant, his writing, like the work he championed, is fastidious, precise, and carefully coordinated. And, as anyone who has attempted to paraphrase it can attest, it is also impressively efficient. Banham was hard on himself when it came to his prose,83 and he was hard on the subjects of that prose when they failed to live up to the high standards he demanded. Above all, Banham praised precision, efficiency, and thorough coordination in the objects he examined. Adhocism offered an easy shortcut by which to bypass these requirements and thus could only be seen as an offense. While he once might have suggested the rejection of \u201cthe accepted rules of architecture\u2014symmetry, unity, coherence, balance, and all of those,\u201d84 Banham would never relinquish his taste for efficiency, rigor, and conviction. These qualities, for the most part, were what he found at Centre Pompidou. And it was these qualities that raised the enigmatic questions with which Banham concluded his essay. One question was operational. For if the facility had been commissioned and designed to accommodate adaptable flexibility, critics could no longer hold the architects solely responsible for the work\u2019s quality, \u201cthe question of management will qualify all attempts to judge whether the Centre is functionally adequate.\u201d85 The other question was symbolic: \u201cCentre Pompidou is clearly a monument, a very permanent monument presenting what is already a fixed image to outward view, and few of the routine modifications that might be adapted to its services and other externals is likely to have much effect on that fixed image of transparency and tracery, bright color and mechanical equipment. But can one have a permanent image of change?\u201d The question encapsulated a central paradox of High Tech architecture as well as Banham\u2019s own writing\u2014a contradictory drive to cleave to the monumental values of traditional architecture and simultaneously to advance an \u201cother\u201d set of values characterized by flexibility and change. On one hand, he sought a fixed and indelible image, on the other, the fleeting, ephemeral traces of incessant transformation. For Banham, \u201cthe problem is one that has fascinated philosophers and poets as long as language has been able to distinguish the two concepts, but it has troubled architectural theory only since the Futurists at the beginning of the present century decided to celebrate the impermanence of technology.\u201d85 By driving adaptability so deeply into the fabric of the structure, no + Rogers had unleashed a powerful new image on the Parisian milieu and ha P ssed the question into uncharted territory. Returning once more to the Cen ompidou s persistent modernism, Banham concluded with what, depending ones stylistic allegiances, can be taken as easily for a premonition as a hedge, that fixed image can retain its present power until, say, the century s end, Cent Pompidou will prove to have succeeded in one of the most teasing but centralta* ^ that were in the unwritten (pace Giedion) programme of the Modern Movement notes Colin Davies cited the Reliance Controls Building as High Tech's first building, with the Bathroom Tow as a close rival for the title.\u201d See Colin Davies, High Tech Architecture (New York: Rizzoli, 1988), 19* Pete Buchanan, another important early chronicler of the movement, credited the Bathroom Tower with,naUg^ rating the movement.

All three would prove influential to Rogers, rims and company. Peter Cook began teaching at the AA shortly after his graduation in 1960, one year after finished but in time to instruct Grimshaw and Hopkins.

Foster would set up and then subvert classical expectations at, among other examples, the 1978 Sainsbury Centre in Norwich, England, where the entry also is punched through the side, and at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Headquarters, which admits and disgorges visitors via splayed escalators that slice through the raised atrium\u2019s glazed underbelly. 33 Ezra Ehrenkrantz (1932 2001) was a strong influence on Foster and Rogers and routinely is cited in the literature on the two architects.

While these members comprise approximately 2,200 pounds of steel (42 beam ends at 18\u201d = 63' o\u201d x 35 Ib./ft. = 2,205 lb.), they also serve to carry the roof overhang and are therefore justified structurally in a way the longer beam ends are not. 46 See, for example, reviews of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment by James Marston Fitch, \u201cReview of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment,\u201d Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 29 (1970): 282 84; and John Kouwenhoven, \u201cArchitecture as Environmental Technology,\u201d Technology and Culture 11, no. 1 (1970): 85 93. 47 See \u201cArchitecture Awards 1972,\u201d RIBA Journal 79, no. 7 0972): 276.

See p.156, % 57 M AKING architecture THF FTHICS OF HIGH TECH I\u2014 I\u2014 phrase in its title.2 The book is largely a style catalog for interior design that favors industrial elements deployed ad hoc within domestic and corporate milieus. Buchanan, an editor at the Architectural Review throughout the early 1980s, prov' a series of useful interpretations.4 In an echo of Banham s assessment of the Brutalism, he argued that High Tech began as a promising anti art mode d ^ primarily by \u201cprocess\u201d toward \u201cindeterminacy,\u201d and then it matured into a high a pursuit of elegant architectural assemblies. Rehearsing Banham s portrayal of th megastructure movement, he saw High Tech tending simultaneously toward opera tional freedom and stylistic control. The movement, he claimed, was heading eithe to an \u201carcadian\u201d extreme in which \u201cthe building evaporates (he offered Banham s musings in \u201cA Home Is Not a House\u201d as an example) or to a \u201cutopian one that, in its pursuit of ultimate flexibility in long span structures, paradoxically results in little more than monumental rhetoric (as he read Centre Pompidou).5 In another assess ment, he outlined a \u201cvitalist\u201d camp that used technology primarily as an alibi for formal elaboration (a line that begins with James Stirling and develops toward Fos ter and Rogers) and a \u201clifestyle\u201d group extending from Archigram and Cedric Price that sought to deploy technology to enhance the social situation.6 Echoing George Baird\u2019s dismissal of \u201ctotal architecture\u201d and \u201clife conditioning,\u20197 Buchanan rejected both approaches. His assessments were ultimately skeptical. High Tech, for him, was \u201ca shallowly conceived and deeply alienating project.\u201d8 In 1978, Charles Jencks coined the term \u201cLate Modern architecture to dis tinguish more orthodox contemporary practices from emerging postmodern posi tions, and he included \u201cHigh Tech\u201d among a collection of subcategories he outlined within the idiom.9 Reacting against the polarized debate on High Tech in England in a 1988 text, Jencks dispassionately tallied the movement\u2019s formal characteristics.10 Though he ultimately favored the postmodern works he had championed throughout his career, Jencks supported the continued development of High Tech. A robust and multifaceted debate on style, he reasoned, signaled a vital, interesting, and ultimately democratic architectural culture. Colin Davies\u2019s 1988 book, High Tech Architecture, stands as an emphatic punctuation mark to the literature. In his introductory essay, he provided both a long range history, which stretches back to Abraham Darby Ill\u2019s Iron Bridge 0779) near Coalbrookdale, England, and a short range one, which stemmed from the radical architects of the 1960s. Familiar long range precedents such as the Crystal Palace, the Eiffel Tower, and various nineteenth century halls were recounted, as were more recent works by the Archigram group, Pierre Chareau, Buckminster Fuller, Cedric Price, and Jean Prouve. The short range history divided neatly into an inaugural period marked by the Reliance Controls Building and the Bathroom Tower, a middle period around Centre Pompidou, and a waning phase signaled by Foster\u2019s Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Headquarters (fig. 5.1; see pi. 14) and Richard Rogers\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s of London building (fig. 5.2; see fig. 5.15). An important discussion turned about construction details, with Piano\u2019s complex bolted connections standing in stark contrast to Foster\u2019s minimal neoprene gaskets. Like previous commentators, he noted High Tech\u2019s particularly British inflections, as well as the movement\u2019s difficult tensions between technique and style, operative flexibility and formal legibility, revolution and continuity. Importantly, Davies treated High Tech as a completed project. In a Jencksian twist, he even provided a precise date for the \u201cdeath of the High Tech style\u201d \u2014 28 January 1986, the day the space shuttle Challenger, a significant symbol of contemporary culture\u2019s embrace of technology, exploded due to \u201cthe failure of a Neoprene gasket.\u201d11 fig. 5.1 Foster Associates (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935).

Other writings on High Tech tend toward largely hagiographic monographs on the work of Foster, Piano, Rogers, and Nicholas Grimshaw, and occasional attacks by critics such as Prince Charles, Leon Krier, Joseph Rykwert, and others. A few positive and negative gems exist, but in large part, High Tech passed from architec tural conversation after 1988.13 Despite the early posturing of Jencks and Banham, by the late 1980s, postmodern architecture\u2019s significant stylistic adversary was no longer High Tech but rather deconstructivist architecture.14 Even throughout the 1970s, High Tech architects rarely entered the critical fray. While the Whites and the Grays sparred in the American architectural journals over theoretical projects and small scale residential work,15 High Tech architects in Europe quietly went about the business of putting up major buildings in cities around the world. Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech With extended treatments by Jencks and Davies, 1988 was the banner year for High Tech publication. In March of that year, Reyner Banham died of cancer. In the months leading up to his death, he had been at work on his own book length assessment of the movement. Though the final form and specific content of the book remained unsettled, Banham offered his \u201ccurrent thinking on the subject in a letter to his publisher and an attached summary, outline, and draft introductory chapter.16 In the summary, Banham established Centre Pompidou as \u201cA Monument of Definition.\u201d17 From it, he gleaned five \u201ccanonical characteristics,\u201d which he developed as the \u201cElements and Origins of the Canon.\u201d The first, wide span construction connected High Tech to \u201cthe most central tradition of the modern movement, one which has the warrant of [Peter] Behrens, [Eugene] Freyssinet, Fuller, [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe among designers, and [Sigfried] Giedion, [Nikolaus] Pevsner, and others among writers.\u201d18 Next, he pointed out the necessity of a \u201chigh level of mechanical servicing,\u201d which, as he had argued in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, \u201chas no such place in the explicit traditions of the modern movement, in spite of the fact that most modern buildings would be un inhabitable without it.\u201d The third characteristic, \u201cexpressed structure,\u201d raised questions about the nature of architecture\u2019s interactions with engineering practice, while the fourth, \u201cexhibiting the services,\u201d seemed to represent \u201ca very different achievement, and one for which the architects are almost solely responsible.\u201d The culmination of these factors resulted in \u201cthe invention of a unified aesthetic for structure and services\u201d with roots deep in the modern movement.19 Banham\u2019s intent to concentrate on visual style is apparent throughout. \u201cThe crucial stages in accommodating the art of architecture to advances in technology,\u201d he opined, \u201chave always been stylistic.\u201d20 In the modern movement, it was Mies van der Rohe who \u201cestablished] the kind of standard by which most other architectural excursions into higher technology are judged.\u201d21 For while \u201c[Auguste] Perret forced an old aesthetic on concrete, and Le Corbusier forced a new one on it, Mies discovered a new mode of expression within steel construction.\u201d22 Working in the same manner but with different technologies, High Tech architects seemed to offer the possibility of once again discovering a new aesthetic in the expression of mechanical services. Yet, as he argued in a section on \u201cAn Opposite Case,\u201d such reasoning failed to account for a project such as Foster\u2019s Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters, \u201cwhich reveals nothing at all of its structure or workings, and yet tends to get classified as High Tech.\u201d Suggesting that recent computer controlled \u201cSmart Buildings\u201d might indicate the terrain for architecture\u2019s next engagement with high technology, he suggested these projects \u201cmay prefigure an even higher form of High Tech.\u201d23 In a final section, on the \u201cScope of the Study,\u201d he outlined his intention to examine existing literature on High Tech, larger issues pertaining to modernism in general, and \u201chostile commentary by supporters of the Post Modernist position.\u201d For Banham, High Tech and modernism were intertwined and require parallel exposition. High Tech, he concluded, \u201chas raised questions that are fundamental both to Modernism and to Architecture.\u201d24 Thus, Banham planned a book sharply differentiated from the writings of previous commentators. Where Kron and Slesin saw the superficial trappings of a fashionable new decorative idiom, Banham saw profound implications for the history of modern architecture. Where Buchanan described a regional movement of primarily British extraction, Banham intended to portray a global phenomenon with important American, French, and German ancestors and significant practitioners at work around the globe. And where Jencks found a nostalgic maintenance of modernist stylistic tropes that paled in comparison to the broad semantic pluralism of postmodern architecture, Banham saw an important swerve away from orthodox habits that developed an \u201calternative Modernism\u201d out of new technologies.25 As the draft introduction Banham prepared for the book makes clear, he saw in High Tech an architecture that paradoxically maintained close ties to the ideologies of the modern movement yet diverged from certain of its principles to suggest a manner of working that might overcome modern architecture\u2019s deficiencies to stand in staunch resistance to postmodern architecture. High Tech and Advanced Engineering In his characteristic style, Banham outlined in his introduction the terminology, characteristics, and core complexities of High Tech architecture. His opening comparison between the skillfully styled but more or less conventional Salomon ski boot (fig. 5.3) and the Moulton AM 7 bicycle (fig. 5.4), which, he claimed, rejected fig. 5.3 Salomon SX 91 ski boot O987). fig. 5.4 Moulton AM 7 (1983). Photo by Tom Taylor. \u201cself conscious decision about what style to employ,\u201d26 baldly signaled his allegiance, as it is well known that Banham had been an avid cyclist and proud Moulton owner throughout his adult life.27 Regardless of any bias implicit in the comparison, the complex interplay of visual style and actual performance was crucial to Ban ham\u2019s understanding of High Tech. A lengthy comparison of two representative buildings, Dewhurst Haslam Partnership\u2019s United Kingdom headquarters for Porsche (Reading, 1986) (fig. 5.5) and Foster Associates\u2019 Warehouse and Distribution Center for Renault (Swindon, 1983) (fig 5 6), demonstrated the wide range of stylistic possibilities in High Tech. Porsche, Banham noted, aligned neatly with established characteristics of what he termed \u201cModern architecture of the International Style.\u201d28 This pivot from modern architecture in general toward the more specific International Style was crucial. Throughout his career, Banham was highly attentive to specific subcategories within modern architecture, such as futurism, expressionism, and constructivism, which he focused on in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, and the New Brutalism, clip on, megastructure, and High Tech, which were the focus of numerous texts from the 1950s to the \u201980s. Over the course of his career, Banham marshaled each of these minor modern movements into his cause of charting an alternative trajectory into the immediate future to the one outlined under the banner of International Style, which Banham saw as the modern movement\u2019s primary inflection. Distinguishing the International Style as something less than the modern movement as a whole gave Banham a way to continue his attack on certain aspects of modern architecture without damning the modern movement outright. This bracketing of the International Style would prove crucial to his revisionist agenda with respect to modern architecture. Curiously, Banham did not refer directly to the arguments of Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson to align the Porsche building with the International Style. Instead, he cited the three part postulation of planar volumes, regular massing, and lack of applied ornamentation as the style\u2019s essential traits that Alfred Barr had laid out in his preface to Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s book.29 With its bright colors and filigreed silhouette, Banham argued, Renault adhered to a different set of characteristics: \u201cthe use of... bright, usually primary colors,\u201d \u201ca conspicuous exhibition of structure,\u201d and \u201cexposure of mechanical and environmental services.\u201d30 These, Banham continued, \u201cmay well be called the three distinguishing stylistic principles of High Tech,\u201d3' and they served to demarcate a stylistic boundary between that idiom and the International Style. Once again, Banham offered a tidy, three part taxonomy of the visual qualities of an architectural movement. For the New Brutalism, it had been \u201cMemorability as an Image,\u201d \u201cClear exhibition of Structure,\u201d and \u201cValuation of Materials \u2018as found.\u2019\u201d32 In his 1961 text \u201cDesign by Choice,\u201d Banham refined these tenets to become a \u201cconvincing unity of the total effect,\u201d a frank exhibition of services, and standardized products used \u201coff the peg,\u201d thus formulating several years avant la lettre an approximation of the visual characteristics of clip on architecture.33 In the context of High Tech, one finds a further development. A unified aesthetic was presumed and warranted no explicit mention; exposed structure and services were placed on an equal footing; and a bold fig. 5.5 Dewhurst Haslam Partnership (Derek Dewhurst, British, b. 1929; David Haslam, British, b. 1939) Porsche United Kingdom Headquarters (Reading, England, 1986).

MAKING ARCHITECTDPE' International Style New Brutalism Clip On High Tech Planar Volumes Memorable Images Exposed Services Exposed Services Regular Massing Exposed Structure Unity of Effect Exposed Structure Blank Surfaces As Found Materials Off the Peg Products Bold Colors use of color replaced both the honesty of \u201cas found\u201d and the expediency of off the peg.\u201d Taken together, these three formulas trace Banham\u2019s shifting position on the visual qualities he associated with \u201cotherness\u201d throughout his career. Reading them against Barr\u2019s International Style characteristics, one can tabulate Banhams alignments with and swerves from orthodox modern architecture (table i). Banham\u2019s encapsulations of the New Brutalism and clip on emphatically stated the requirement of a coherent visual image (derived from exposed structure and exposed service elements, respectively); with respect to both the International Style and High Tech, he assumed its presence. The former derived its coherence from planar forms and \u201cregular\u201d massing, while the latter derived it from the inherent visual logic of structure and services. Significantly, none of the four stylistic categories sanctioned compositional strategies based on ad hoc juxtaposition or collage, just as none betrayed any overt allegiance to classical coherence.34 Ban ham distanced his own position from both qualities throughout his career, which points to a fundamental agreement between certain modern movement values and his own. Each category also called for a distinct material effect: abstract blankness and concrete physicality in the older pair, and the artificiality of off the peg (often plastic) elements and applied color in the newer one. This marks a shift in Banham\u2019s material sensibility one might attribute to his well known appetite for pop in both art and culture. Paradoxically, neither of the examples Banham examined in his introductory comparison adhered to his stylistic criteria. Renault lacked any significant exposition of mechanical services, though its structural system was expressed with bold colors. Porsche lacked all three, and it aligned with exactly the International Style criteria High Tech works supposedly flouted. Here, one must keep in mind that, for Banham, visual style was only part of the equation. Just as the New Brutalism necessitated engagement with the movement\u2019s formal and ideological inflections, High Tech required the historian to consider both visual style and enhanced performance. Importantly, and in sharp contrast to his earlier argumentation in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, \u201cA Home Is Not a House,\u201d The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, and elsewhere, Banham cautioned that this commitment to technologically enhanced performance did not imply a move away from architecture as a discipline. High Tech, he reminded his readers, was \u201cstill architecture, \u2018the mother of the arts,\u2019 with all that is implied in that traditional claim.\u201d35 Banham ended his essay by returning to the famous closing passage of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, in which the technologically engaged architect may be required to \u201cdiscard his whole cultural load including the professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect\u201d in order to keep pace with technology.36 In stark contrast to one of his most oft quoted lines, Banham argued in his introduction that High Tech, the direct inheritor of the attitudes he had outlined nearly thirty years earlier, demonstrated \u201chow far some architects were prepared to go, in defiance of a rising tide of historical revivalism, in order to keep up with advanced engineering, but without divesting themselves of those \u2018professional garments.\u2019\u201d37 Positioning his work emphatically against both the International Style and postmodern architecture, he closed by defining High Tech as \u201can alternative Modernism that had arisen from what might be termed the \u2018disgrace\u2019 of the older Modernism of the International Style,\u201d which had, in his view, \u201csurprised the world of architecture by becoming successful against the grain of expectations in the ostensibly Post Modernist culture of the nineteen seventies and eighties.\u201d38 Banham wrote these lines as he was recovering from the cancer surgery he had undergone in August 1987. Judging by other materials in the archive, the letter, summary, and outline of 15 December represent his final recorded thoughts on High Tech. And while Making Architecture would remain unfinished, Banham\u2019s earlier writings and teaching throughout the 1980s hint at his intentions for articulating \u201cthis alternative Modernism.\u201d39 In them, Banham demonstrated an acute attention to the imagistic concerns of visual style as well as to the often invisible signals of enhanced performance. This two pronged line of inquiry led him to engage projects as both autonomous objects and immersive environments, to celebrate them as often for carefully assembled construction details as for masterfully choreographed atmospheric effects, and to write from the contrasting vantage points of the attentive connoisseur and distracted flaneur. Although many of the writings examined in this study saw Banham leaning heavily to one or the other extreme (or shifting abruptly from one to the other), his late writings on High Tech demonstrate an attempt to accommodate these contrasting ambitions under the rubric of what he called \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d With this \u201cdeceptively simple phrase,\u201d which, he admitted, \u201csome may find...rather old fashioned,\u201d40 Banham attempted to capture the elusive qualities that defined not just High Tech but also the fundamental essence of architecture itself. fig. 5.7 Richard Rogers Partnership (Richard Rogers, British, b.

Making Architecture Four major themes can be traced through Banham\u2019s late work on High Tech. Throughout it, one encounters a consistent appeal to functionalism and technology. This staunch commitment to core modernist values leads Banham explicitly to champion the continued relevance of the machine aesthetic as the ultimate source of High Tech\u2019s visual qualities. For Banham, the machine aesthetic implied a particular form of part to whole coherence, leading him to a keen attentiveness to construction details. This commitment to rational and legible building assemblies prompted repeated reflections on the canon of modern architecture, the clear genealogy of works extending back through innovative structures of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and projecting forward through High Tech into the immediate future. Taken together, these themes comprise the fundamental components of Banham\u2019s attempts to make sense of the varied output of High Tech architects and to articulate the task of \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d A 1982 treatment of Richard Rogers\u2019s Inmos Microprocessor Factory (Newport, Wales, 1982) (figs. 5.7, 5.8) demonstrates Banham\u2019s nuanced position regarding functionalism.41 At Inmos, significant mechanical provisions were required to accommodate the facility\u2019s \u201cclean room\u201d for microchip assembly, resulting in an extensible, axial scheme with an array of air handling equipment prominently displayed on the building\u2019s roof. In this, Rogers turned the organization of Henman and Cooper\u2019s Royal Victoria Hospital (1903) (see figs. 3.6, 3.7) on its head. Where in the older building an axial array of mechanical equipment was deployed invisibly beneath the building (as Team 4 would later do at Reliance Controls), at Inmos, Rogers placed the required equipment proudly in view. Yet, for Banham, the imagery at Inmos was less about legibly representing this equipment than about producing a palpable feeling of necessity that he likened to that of sailing ships: \u201cThe air of conviction that pervades almost every part of the design seems to derive, as in naval architecture, from a sense of necessity, a feeling that nothing could be other than it is.\u201d42 Banham also noticed this link between function and necessity in Piano + Rogers\u2019s B&B Italia Office Building (1971 73) in Novedrate, Italy, where he found \u201cnothing to be seen in, or on, this building beyond what is necessary as architecture.\u201d Importantly, this constituted \u201ca little more than what might be necessary as engineering, but the purely engineering solution would not be anywhere near as rich. The difference between those two conceptions of \u2018necessary\u2019 is what makes architecture of B&B.\u201d43 If architecture, as opposed to engineering practice, required an excess of necessity, so too did nautical works move beyond the strictly functional. Much of the necessity on display in sailing ships, Banham explained, was \u201crhetorical,\u201d even \u201csuperstitious.\u201d44 In the end, it was not the fact but rather the feeling of necessity that was crucial to the inherent rightness of both sailing ships and High Tech architecture. And while this accommodation of rhetorical elements certainly represented a softening of the ruthless logic Banham had praised in the New Brutal ism and elsewhere,45 it maintained his consistent requirement of \u201capprehensibility and coherence of the building as a visual entity.\u201d46 In addition, and notwithstanding his requirement that performance actually be delivered, it underlined Banham\u2019s insistence that the problem of functionalism was first and foremost aesthetic. Linked to Banham\u2019s advocacy of functionalism was his faith in the enduring relevance of the machine aesthetic. \u201cThe concept of the Machine Age,\u201d he intoned in a 1976 lecture, \u201cwon\u2019t go away.\u201d47 In an interview a decade later, he opined, I think the one continuing cultural significance is the desire to convince clients and passersby, visually, that this is a building that really works like a machine. The occasional passing quotation from the Crystal Palace, as for example at Lloyd\u2019s, is more a profession of faith in the tradition.... When the Rogers office or the Foster office does an apparent quote from a 19th Century structure, it is a quite considered, deliberate statement that they belong to that grand old Rationalist tradition.48 That \u201cgrand old Rationalist tradition\u201d of glazed, iron framed construction had been outlined in canonical books by Nikolaus Pevsner and Sigfried Giedion.49 Banham was unconvinced by the links these authors drew between nineteenth century precedents and the canonical twentieth century projects. In his eyes, the \u201cInternational Style work of Giedion\u2019s friends Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, or Pevsner\u2019s hero, Gropius\u201d did not resonate visually with the \u201copen work, transparent\u201d frames of \u201cthe Grand Constructeurs\u201d of the nineteenth century such as Joseph Paxton and Gustave Eiffel.50 Here again, Banham nudged the label \u201cthe International Style\u201d away from Hitchcock and Johnson, this time not toward Alfred Barr but rather toward more proximate adversaries in the fight to define modern architecture, namely Pevsner and Giedion. And if these historians were unconvincing in their association of Corbusier, Mies, and Gropius with the \u201cRationalist tradition\u201d of the nineteenth century, Banham felt he was on surer footing, offering Foster, Piano, and Rogers as rightful heirs to that tradition. These younger architects\u2019 tendency to use open frames and exposed fasteners and to foreground the starkly mechanical over the Platonically abstract aligned them with \u201cthat \u2018Other\u2019 modernist tradition \u2014that of Constructivism, Futurism, etc.\u201d to which Banham had devoted so much attention throughout his career.5' Importantly, if High Tech rejected the refined abstractions of the International Style, it also seemed to move away from the jarring radicalism Banham had earlier sought under the banner of une architecture autre. For if, as he surmised in 1966, une architecture autre was \u201csomething the traditions of architecture could not absorb,\u201d52 then High Tech, the true inheritor of the \"other\u201d tradition, displayed \u201ca desire for clarity and frugality in resolving functional problems within the canons of architecture.\u201d53 In his late writings, Banham repeatedly forged deliberate links between the work of the 1970s and \u201980s and the tradition of technological innovation dating to the nineteenth century. In his final years, one finds interspersed with these arguments broader speculation on the links between architecture and technology in general. High Tech was presented as the inheritor not just of the grand traditions of Victorian engineering and the machine aesthetic but also of a technological legacy stretching back to antiquity. This attitude pervades the seminar on High Tech he led at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) in 1987. He devoted three of the term\u2019s ten weeks to High Tech\u2019s historical pedigree, spending one week each on \u201cTechnology and Architecture,\u201d \u201cHistory and Symbolism,\u201d and the \"Ancestors of High Tech.\u201d54 Though these lectures unfortunately were not recorded, lecture notes taken by student Janey Bennett offer a sense of the material Banham covered.55 In the course, Banham linked all architecture closely with technology, though his typical partisanship was clearly on display. Bennett recorded in her notes an early contrast of the Doric order (a \u201cconservative technology\u201d) with the technical daring of the Gothic period (\u201cnot conservative\u201d). Where Greek architects were mocked for their ornamental tendencies (\u201cI know it fell down but the fluting on the columns was beautiful\u201d56), the Gothic period won praise for bolder innovation (marked, ironically, by a high rate of structural failure) and for a culture in which \u201ctechnicians were admired most.\u201d57 A similar partitioning can be seen in Banham\u2019s discussion of the Crystal Palace (\u201cconservative\u201d58) and the Brooklyn Bridge (\u201ccutting edge stuff\u201d59). A text Banham often cited, Paul Valery\u2019s Eupalinos, ou I\u2019architecte (1921), also found its place in the seminar.60 Banham had referenced Valery\u2019s contrast of the architect Eupalinos and the shipwright Tridon years earlier in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment: \u201cThe former was preoccupied with the right method for doing the allotted tasks, and deploying the accepted methods, of his calling, and seemed to find a philosophical problem in every practical decision. Tridon, on the other hand, applied the technology that came conveniently to hand, whether or not it was part of the shipbuilding tradition, and treated the sayings of philosophers as further instruction of the direct solution of practical problems.\u201d61 At UCSC, Ban ham\u2019s praise of Tridon\u2019s boffinesque pragmatism and distaste for Eupalinos\u2019s intellectual proclivities was far blunter. \u201cOne loaded gun beats 4 aces,\u201d reads Bennett\u2019s notes, followed by \u201cdesign defeats itself by being too good.\u201d62 With these and other examples, Banham rehearsed some of his most well known argumentation: praising aggressive technical innovation, damning overt theoretical speculation, and defining architecture as a field fundamentally linked to technology yet perennially hamstrung by both methodological convention and delusions of intellectual grandeur. Though Banham directed significant attention to the visual qualities of High Tech buildings and their sources in the modern architecture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, he ultimately saw modernism as far more than a style. Rather, the concept represented an underlying ethos of rationality that held firm beneath visually diverse and chronologically distant buildings and continued to exert a vital influence on contemporary culture. Modernism, he argued, \u201cmade sense to the kind of practical minded men who managed the building programs of major corporate and government clients.\u201d63 Of course, making sense to such \u201cpractical minded men\u201d might mean little more than reinforcing their agendas, and thus close associations with corporate and government culture could as easily represent modernism's \u201ctriumph\u201d as its \u201ctragedy.\u201d The latter, he found, was the case of the MACE system for school construction,64 which \u201ccould not protect its original social idealism and aesthetic vision against the erosions and corrosions of three decades of cost cutting and vote chasing.\u201d The results were no \u201cmere stylistic crisis,\u201d as many critics took them to be, but rather \u201ca complicated civic and professional disaster.\u201d Where postmodern critics stepped in to articulate the faults of misfires such as MACE in stylistic terms (and also to offer alternatives in stylistic terms), Banham noticed that \u201cManfredo Tafuri, almost alone, with his concept of the inability of architecture as a profession to deliver the \u2018Utopia of Social Democracy\u2019 to which the Modern Movement had been committed, seems to have understood the magnitude of the problem.\u201d Implying that he was also to be counted among those who saw the writing on the wall, Banham continued, but one may beg leave to dif fer from his diagnosis: the problem may have been less to do with social ideology than with the business of actually putting buildings together. Banham would routinely sidestep ideological questions by pivoting to construction details, and doing so left him open to criticism that he was unconcerned with the ideological implications of architecture\u2019s technological servicing and icono graphic symbolization of the status quo. Referring to Banham as a paladin of technological orthodoxy,\u201d Tafuri suggested as much in otherwise respectful comments in i976.6S Indeed, for Banham, the central preoccupation of the resurgent modern architecture of High Tech was detailing\u2014not ideology, materials, or style \u2014and it was in their detailing that such works would demonstrate their efficacy and earn their status not only as modern but also as architecture. Consider his treatment of details at Rogers\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s of London building: Confront any single detail \u2014 the fixing of the uprights of the handrails of the external stairs, for instance \u2014 and one is looking at a design solution that would be virtually inconceivable in normal engineering practice. An engineer might, indeed, have done a handrail upright for half the price, but the result would not have been half as rewarding as a piece of architecture\u2014 Engineering is one way of designing things, architecture is another. The triumph of Lloyd s is, paradoxically, that it is so often difficult to tell them apart.66 Or consider his careful description of the connections at Renzo Piano\u2019s IBM Traveling Pavilion (1982 86; figs. 5.9, 5.10; see pi. 15): A complex metal element sits in a trunnion that permits movement (shades of Behren\u2019s Turbinfabrik!)[. T]o its inner face is bolted the anchorage of a stay to hold the plastic glazing, while its top is split into four teeth which accept three matching teeth cut in the end of the laminated wooden rib which forms the first component of the half arch above. This object is a work of architectural art in its own right, the complexity of its functions and connections is an architectural composition richer than many complete buildings, and the fanaticism that informs its conception suggests the kind of passion that Le Corbusier found in the modenature [sic] of Michelangelo.67 Examples of this deft combination of precise description, historical contextualiza tion, and exuberant celebration of construction details can be found throughout Banham\u2019s writing on the work of Foster, Piano, Rogers, and elsewhere.68 In these writings, as Nigel Whiteley noticed, Banham returned to many of the disciplinary values he first articulated in the context of the New Brutalism.69 Whiteley did not comment, however, on Banham\u2019s reversal of his attitude toward details. In 1955, Banham advocated the Smithsons\u2019 \u201cabstemious under designing\u201d of the details at Hunstanton. By the mid 1980s, he appeared fully to support \u201carty\u201d details such as those he had chastised at Louis Kahn\u2019s Yale University Art Gallery.70 And while Banham did endorse the minimal gasketed joints employed by Foster at the buildings for the IBM Pilot Head Office and Willis Faber & Dumas, in those writings one scarcely finds the glowing praise he lavished on Piano\u2019s complex connections. \u201cHigh Tech,\u201d as Banham put it in the context of Rogers\u2019s work, \u201cas epitomized by the elaborate and painstaking detailing of Lloyd\u2019s, was clearly preoccupied with putting buildings together properly.\u201d71 Piano\u2019s work similarly was centered around the careful assembly of building components. And while Piano described his approach to architecture as \u201cdealing with a language,\u201d Banham maintained that \u201cthe linguistic analogy does not quite explain the complete situation.\u201d In projects such as the IBM Pavilion, \u201cthe pieces do not form a simple hierarchical assembly, in which one piece supports another piece which supports another, etc., but the ribs and plexiglass [s/c] pyramids work together to form a complex three dimensional truss, whose \u2018whole is greater than its parts.\u2019 The pieces are usually perceived by Piano himself, and by anyone who looks at the finished work, as organic parts of the building as a whole.\u201d72 Thus, Banham found in Piano\u2019s work an unapologetically classical form of part to whole coherence. A similar appeal to traditional notions of unity can be found in his discussion of Lloyd\u2019s: \u201cThe more unified image produced by the almost monochrome finishes, as opposed to the diverse colors of say, Centre fig. 5.9 Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Renzo Piano, Italian, b.1937).

Pompidou, which tended to separate the parts, draws attention to the kind of uni tied general conception that is usually supposed to be the product of architectural designing.\u201d73 While Banham had flirted with ad hoc composition and expendable construction throughout his career, he never fully endorsed them. In his late writings on High Tech, he emphatically rejected such tactics and instead championed traditional disciplinary values such as unity, permanence, and monumentality. In 1965, in the context of clip on, Banham had written, \u201cWhat was at stake in all these projects, concepts, and the rare completed buildings, was an architecture whose form was not defined by the accepted rules of architecture \u2014 symmetry, unity, coherence, balance, and all of those.\u201d74 Two decades later, he appeared to be betting heavily on at least three of those four qualities as the bases of a technological architecture \u201cappropriate to the times.\u201d75 The elegant assembly of architectural components into coherent unities Banham saw at the IBM Pavilion was at the core of \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d In later works, such as Piano\u2019s museum for the Menil Collection in Houston (1986) (figs. 5.11, 5.12; see pi. 16) and his Lowara Office Building (Vicenza, Italy, 1984 85) (figs. 5.13, 5.14), Banham saw the concept developed \u201cbeyond joining neat pieces together organically... to involving] the whole conception of the building.\u201d76 Both projects are dominated by complex roof elements\u2014a series of carefully sculpted concrete louvers in the former and a sweeping curved plane in the latter. In each case, these elements were carefully detailed and not only provided building form and structure but also, much to Banham\u2019s delight, contributed to \u201can elaborate program of environmental management.\u201d77 In section, the high end of Lowara\u2019s roof peeks T\"? above an adjacent factory building to the south (see fig. 5.13). At first blush, lifting the roof to invite direct southern sunlight to the interior would seem counterintuitive. Yet rather than admit this glaring light directly, Piano nestled a curved reflector against the project\u2019s canted steel columns to bounce that light into the opposing curve of the adjacent corridor\u2019s roof, delivering tempered natural light to the space below. Freestanding light fixtures within the main office area were aimed vertically to reflect their light off the convex roof surface above similarly to provide indirect illumination throughout the facility. At Menil, Piano developed an intricate ceiling assembly comprised of triangulated roof trusses capped by shallowly sloped glass gables. A cast concrete light reflector\u2014its curved surfaces carefully calibrated to bathe the galleries in diffuse natural light while ensuring that damaging direct rays would never be admitted \u2014 was suspended from each truss (see fig. 5.11). Describing the space for Art in America in 1987, Banham was uncommonly poetic: The floors are stained almost black, so that the strips of bronze ventilation grille are hardly visible; the walls are painted white, and over them spreads a light of\u2014frankly\u2014ethereal beauty. That is not the kind of language that I use very frequently, but the quality of light that enters the Menil through the sunshades is breathtaking. The only gallery light that I can compare it with is that in Louis Kahn\u2019s Kimbell [Art Museum] in Fort Worth, but whereas the light under the vaults there is mysterious and largely a matter of optical illusion \u2014 it looks natural but is heavily supplemented with artificial \u2014 the daylight in the Menil is honest, pellucid, and without additives.78 fig. 5.13 Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Renzo Piano, Italian, b 1937) Lowara Office Building (Vicenza, Italy, 1984 85).

Though the Menil was replete with Piano\u2019s signature details, Banham directed his comments primarily at Piano\u2019s integration of the building into its suburban context and to the atmospheric qualities of its gallery spaces (see fig. 5.12, pi. 16). While Art in America\u2019s primarily nonarchitectural readership might account for this shift in emphasis, one finds a similar concentration on immersive environmental effects in Banham\u2019s earlier discussion of Lloyd\u2019s (fig. 5.15): fig. 5.15 Richard Rogers Partnership (Richard Rogers, British, b. Italy, 1933). Lloyd\u2019s of London (London, 1986). Interior view of central atrium. Photo by Richard Bryant. When one looks down into the pit of the Room where the business of Lloyd\u2019s is actually done, one is suddenly struck by the recognition that its uncanny resemblance to a set piece from some old science fiction movie is less due to the glittering finishes or the exposed structure or the illuminated criss crossing escalators, than to the sheer numbers of grey and brown clad human beings (up to 5000 at a time, it is believed) moving about everywhere. It is like up market Kafka, or T. S. Eliot\u2019s \u2018many\u2019 whom \u2018death had undone\u2019 re choreographed by Busby Berkely [sic], A great spectacle of financial power, but is it necessary?79 To answer his own question, Banham confronted the dissipative effects of contemporary technology with the traditional values of architectural place making. \u201cSurely,\u201d he argued, \u201cin the High Tech world of electronic communications and personal computers most of these people could stay home\u2014stay in bed, even\u2014and do their business without crowding on to this hopelessly overloaded site.\u201d That they do not, Banham surmised, was because \u201cbeing there is what it is all about.... Every item of high technology at Lloyd\u2019s, structural, environmental, mechanical, or electrical, services a concept of business that still puts its ultimate faith in face to face contact and rumors whispered in passing ears.\u201d He concluded: \u201cIf one finds this an irony\u2014and it is extremely difficult not to\u2014then it seems to be an irony proper to our late Modern times. Architecture may have abandoned its utopian dreams of changing the world, because the world is perfectly capable of changing itself without architecture\u2019s aid, but the compulsion to try and make sense of the resulting human dilemma is still the most essential quality of Modernism.\u201d In Banham\u2019s estimation, High Tech architects\u2014when successful\u2014enacted Horatio Greenough\u2019s definition of beauty as \u201cthe promise of function made sensuously pleasing.\u201d80 And if the satisfaction of Greenough\u2019s proviso made High Tech buildings beautiful, for Banham, it was the solution of \u201cthe technical problems of creating fit environments for human activities\u201d within the accepted traditions of the discipline that made them architecture.81 The Paradoxes of High Tech In the concept of \u201cmaking architecture,\u201d Banham\u2019s argumentation came full circle. Where earlier writings had placed tradition and technology in opposition, in his writings on High Tech, the latter was ultimately brought in line with the former. But rather than resulting in syntheses, the various themes that have been traced through this chapter each elicited something of a paradox. Earlier invocations of functionalism and technology had led Banham to predict the dissipation of architecture into invisibly serviced milieus (such as the un house he had imagined in 196s).82 But in the context of High Tech, they led him to sanction the visual presentation of functional necessity and to endorse functionally unnecessary rhetorical elements to assure architecture\u2019s legibility. With such tactics, Banham, who had criticized orthodox modern architecture throughout much of his career, closely aligned High Tech projects such as Inmos with the coherent imagery of canonical works such as Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer\u2019s Fagus Factory (Alfeld an der Leine, Germany, 1911) Yet Banham continued to take issue with the International Style, which, as noted above, he associated not only with Hitchcock and Johnson but also closely with Alfred Barr, Sigfried Giedion, and Nikolaus Pevsner. While he would espouse that style\u2019s derivation of the visual character of contemporary works from nineteenth century precedents, he had little enthusiasm for the white walled aesthetic so revered by the modern movement\u2019s first historians. He did, however, maintain a firm commitment to the machine aesthetic, and he offered mechanistic projects such as Centre Pompidou and Renault as alternatives to the International Style that more closely adhered to that movement\u2019s stated ambitions to legibly exhibit functional performance. Reading High Tech\u2019s exuberant compositions against the restrained offerings of the International Style, one might have expected Banham to finally embrace the brash juxtapositions he had flirted with in \u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d and periodically throughout his career. But as has been shown in his repeated admonitions of ad hoc compositional techniques, High Tech inspired him to reject the expedient accretion of elements in favor of elegant, unified compositions reinforced by meticulously crafted construction details. In his careful explication of connective elements, Banham took on the role of attentive and learned connoisseur, engaging High Tech works as discrete aesthetic objects in the manner of his mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner. Yet, as in his treatment of James Stirling\u2019s Olivetti Training Center over a decade earlier,83 Banham\u2019s attention had a tendency to wander from the object of inquiry. The details at Lloyd\u2019s, recall, in the end collapsed into a cacophonous social milieu, while those at Menil vanished into a near spiritual atmosphere dedicated to the physical experience of art. In neither building was the contemplation of architectural details the ultimate goal, even if the specific character of the details that composed each space was crucial to the overall effect. Thus, while Banham himself remained a learned connoisseur, he ultimately found High Tech\u2019s most potent effects in the production of immersive spaces populated by distracted flaneurs. Perhaps strangest of all, Banham, who demonstrated a knack for capturing a movement\u2019s iconographic qualities in tidy tripartite phrases throughout his career, set out to organize a book on High Tech around a set of concepts he admitted were underequipped to fully characterize the movement.84 Banham\u2019s work on Making Architecture began as High Tech architects moved their work resolutely away from adherence to his triple definition of exposed structure, exposed services, and bold colors. Indeed, like Dewhurst Haslam\u2019s Porsche building, discussed in the previous chapter, significant late projects such as Menil and Lowara bore little resemblance to the criteria.85 Yet, as Foster, Piano, and Rogers distanced themselves from the visible iconography of High Tech as a style, they appeared more firmly to embrace the moral imperatives of modernism as a technique for \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d In the pursuit of clearly integrated building technologies, honest and appropriate visual expression, and a unified discipline that governed \u201cthe whole conception of the building,\u201d86 the task of making architecture adhered to a different triple set of criteria Banham outlined toward the end of his career\u2014mot structure, services, and color but rather clarity, honesty, and unity.87 Barr\u2019s Aesthetic Modernism Pevsner\u2019s Stylistic Modernism Giedion\u2019s Tectonic Modernism Banham\u2019s Ethical Modernism planar Volumes Victorian Engineering Iron and Steel Clarity Regular Massing Arts and Crafts Reinforced Concrete Honesty Blank Surfaces Art Nouveau Glass Unity These, Banham pointed out, were central \u201cdogmas\u201d of \u201cthe modernist establishment in Europe\u201d in the interwar years just as they were primary motivating principles for the Eameses, the Smithsons, and other major adherents to modernist doctrine of the immediate postwar period.88 With them in hand, we can differentiate Banham\u2019s position on modern architecture from that of the more orthodox predecessors he had studied at the outset of his career (table 2). The triple formula of planar volumes, regular massing, and blank surfaces Alfred Barr invoked in The International Style outlined a version of modern architecture understood primarily in terms of aesthetics, a vision that bore out in Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s explication of the approach in the same book. Pevsner, in Pioneers of the Modem Movement (1936), defined modern architecture primarily in terms of period styles, seeing it as the inheritor of three traditions: Victorian engineering, the arts and crafts movement, and art nouveau. Giedion, by contrast, laid out a fundamentally tectonic modern architecture in Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisen beton (1928), in which he posited the use of iron and steel, reinforced concrete, and (though he did not include it in his title) glass as central characteristics. Though Banham would grapple with the aesthetic, tectonic, and stylistic implications of modern architecture throughout his career, ultimately, his position came down to the ethical imperatives of clarity, honesty, and unity. These values also featured strongly in the writings of nineteenth century thinkers such as Augustus Pugin, John Ruskin, Gottfried Semper, and Eugene Emmanuel Viollet le Duc; and they colored classical conceptions of architecture dating to antiquity.89 Indeed, more traditional values in architecture scarcely could be found. Though Banham considered abandoning many of architecture\u2019s traditional values in his writings,90 his commitment to clarity, honesty, and unity\u2014tenets meant to outline architecture\u2019s ethics as well as to govern its aesthetics \u2014 never wavered. These qualities capture the essence of the modern architecture Banham saw in High Tech and advocated throughout his career, and their centrality to his notion of \u201cmaking architecture\u201d makes clear that for Banham, technique was the primary determinant of style. NOTES 1 The Oxford English Dictionary puts the first use of the term at 1972, in Stuart Brand\u2019s Last Whole Earth Catalog, no. 1160, which in fact was published in June 197' Banham argues that \u201cno buildings were actually labeled as \u2018High Tech\u2019 until 1979, and the main currency of the term really dates to 1983.\u2019\u2019 See Reyner Banham, \u201cHigh Tech and Advanced Engineering,\u201d ca. 1987, P 1, Reyner Banham papers, acc. no. 910009, box 8, folder 3, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles; and \"High Tech and Advanced Engineering,\u201d this volume, p 233 2 Joan Kron and Suzanne Slesin, High Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for the Home (New York: Clarkson N.

Tellingly, Cook, choosing to highlight the resonance between Rogers\u2019s work and modern architecture, did not use the phrase \u201cHigh Tech\u201d (a tactic employed in most other monographs on Foster, Piano, and Rogers); Sola Morales, criticizing both modern architecture and High Tech, emphasized the term. A late entry into the literature on High Tech is Martin Pawleys Theory and Design in the Second Machine Age (London: Blackwell, 1990), in which he lamented the state of British architecture in the 1980s and, opposing the nostalgic position of Prince Charles and other neohistoricists, presented the possibility of a \u201cGothic Solution\u201d of information and \u201ctechnology transfer.\u201d 14 See Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley, eds., Deconstructivist Architecture (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1988). 15 The White/Gray debate between neomodernist and early postmodernist American architects emerged from a 1969 discussion at the Museum of Modern Art in New York among the \u201cNew York Five\u201d (Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk, and Richard Meier). The White position was galvanized in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s influential catalog Five Architects: Eisenman, Graves, Gwathmey, Hejduk, Meier (New York: Oxford University Press, 1972).

Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at New York University\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts. Though his illness would prevent him from assuming the post, he prepared an inaugural lecture that was published posthumously in Art in America.' In it, Banham saluted his predecessor at NYU, Henry Russell Hitchcock, primarily through an analysis of The International Style, the famous 1932 book Hitchcock coauthored with Philip Johnson. Hitchcock, he argued, \u201cviewed buildings as \u2018discrete aesthetic objects,\u2019 and tended to avoid theory and ideology.\u201d2 While this attitude brought serious drawbacks to the book (particularly an occlusion of the political and social implications of modern architecture), its authors\u2019 unashamed concentration on matters of style was, for Banham, a laudable achievement. Banham also was impressed by Alfred Barr\u2019s provision in the preface to the book of a tidy three part formula \u201cdistinguishing [the] aesthetic principles of the International Style\u201d as planar volumes, regular massing, and blank surfaces.3 \u201cThe propositions,\u201d he claimed, \u201ccurl back on one another until in the end we realize that we are confronted with a kind of minimal \u2014but definitive, integrated, and irreducible description of building in the modern style.\u201d4 In concentrating on the discernible qualities of objects themselves, Banham surmised, Barr\u2019s formulations\u2014as well as Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s book as a whole \u2014 offered a rigorous portrait of modern architecture relatively free of the ideological mystifications that had colored so many other accounts of the movement. Banham often treated his objects of inquiry as \u201cdiscrete aesthetic objects,\u201d and he attempted throughout his career to affect the laconic efficiency of Barr\u2019s triple tenets in his own stylistic formulations of the New Brutalism, clip on architecture, and High Tech. But for Banham, defensible visual criteria were never enough. In his NYU address, for example, he teased out crucial tectonic affiliations (steel or Reyner Banham (English, 1922 88). \u201cA Set of Actual Monuments,\u201d 1988, handwritten manuscript for an inaugural lecture at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, that was never delivered. Los Angeles, Getty Research Institute. concrete construction), economic factors (which necessitated mass production and precluded ornamentation), and extradisciplinary affiliations (such as compositional \u201chelp\u201d drawn from \u201cthe current state of abstract art\u201d) from Barr\u2019s formulas before arriving at a careful statement of the implications of working in a similarly objective manner: \u201cThe sort of blanket definition of a Great International Style that one would derive from the Rationalist attitude could be formulated as: the immanence of a coherent set of structural procedures and esthetic ambitions in an orderly sequence of monuments.\u201d5 Banham\u2019s shift in emphasis was subtle but important. The International Style, in both Barr\u2019s formulation and Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s \u201crigorous description,\u201d6 offered visual, organizational, and material criteria as a test of stylistic orthodoxy. Banham, by contrast, looked to the immanence not of formal properties but rather of \u201cprocedures\u201d and \u201cambitions\u201d in modern architecture. Where each author might be guilty of subscribing to \u201ca good, old fashioned \u2018materials and methods\u2019 view of architectural development,\u201d7 the older generation focused on the \u201cmaterials\u201d that determined a style, while Banham gravitated toward the \u201cmethods\u201d that characterized a technique. A Black Box This valorization of technique over style was implicit in Banham\u2019s early championing of ethics over aesthetics in The New Brutalism, just as it had been in his move away from structure, services, and color toward clarity, honesty, and unity in the context of High Tech. Though meticulously attentive to the formal and organizational characteristics of the building designs he examined, Banham ultimately was less concerned with categorizing aesthetic objects than with understanding (and, often, influencing) the thinking subjects that occupied and executed them. With his final essay, \u201cA Black Box: The Secret Profession of Architecture,\u201d he offered a case in point.8 In this poignant text, written during the terminal phase of his illness and characterized by Peter Hall as his \u201cswan song,\u201d9 Banham reinforced his belief that architecture ultimately was determined not by objects but rather by actions. The text opens with the polemical claim that \u201c[Nicholas] Hawksmoor was an architect and [Christopher] Wren was not,\u201d with the distinction between the two coming down to a difference between \u201cfundamental modes of designing.\u201d10 Banham was at pains to determine the characteristics of the architectural mode, but lacking a clear definition, he proceeded negatively through a series of sharp witted anecdotes to draw increasingly close boundaries around the field. If Wren\u2019s output was not to be mistaken for architecture, neither should the works of \u201cprogrammatic postmodernism.\u201d He took a caustic parting shot at that idiom: \u201cReliance on erudition alone leaves postmodernism in the same relation to architecture as female impersonation to femininity. It is not architecture, but building in drag.\u201d11 Banham\u2019s distinction between architects and engineers was similarly exclusive, if decidedly less derisive toward the outsiders. He characterized engineers as \u201cproblem solvers,\u201d while architects appeared to subscribe to \u201csome secret value system\u201d that had little to do with the solution of environmental or constructional challenges.12 Indeed, he warned that architecture should not be seen as \u201csynonymous with \u2018good design\u2019\u201d or even with the design of buildings.13 This series of exclusions led Banham to his central thesis: \u201cWhat distinguishes architecture is not what is done \u2014since on their good days, all the world and his wife can apparently do it better\u2014but how it is done.\u201d14 Attempting to glean something of the field\u2019s working method, Banham then turned to Christopher Alexander\u2019s notion of a \u201cpattern language.\u201d15 These patterns, Banham explained, contained \u201cknowledge of the form and how to make it.\u201d16 In addition, he continued, these patterns \u201cwill have moral force, will be the only right way of doing that particular piece of designing \u2014at least in the eyes of those who have been correctly socialized into the profession.\u201d For Banham, \u201csuch patterns \u2014perhaps even a finite set of patterns\u2014and their imperatives seem to be shared by all architects, and are, in some sense, what we recognize in Hawksmoor but do not find in Wren.\u201d In this, Banham was rehearsing arguments he had made twenty two years earlier in The New Brutalism. In the conclusion of that book, he ruminated on the tightly circumscribed and ultimately traditional boundaries of the discipline and the consolidation of \u201cmoral force\u201d into a professional ethics by its adherents. The ethic of Brutalism was a campaign of \u201cmens sana in corpore sano,\u201d but no one should have doubted that the mind and the body would prove, ultimately, to be the mind and body which had always belonged to architecture.... I make no pretense that I was not seduced by the aesthetic of Brutalism, but the lingering tradition of its ethical stand, the persistence of an ideal that the relationships of the parts and materials of a building are a working morality \u2014this, for me, is the continuing validity of the New Brutalism.17 Thus, Banham linked architecture\u2019s ethics to its aesthetics through a specific form of coherence between a building\u2019s formal composition, its material instantiation, and an underlying sense of morality. This link had been forged and remained intact, he surmised, through the persistence of a specific disciplinary technique, drawing, which Banham saw as \u201ca kind of meta pattern that subsumes all other patterns and shelters them from rational scrutiny.\u201d18 Produced through drawing, architecture\u2019s patterns emerged as images, just as New Brutalist buildings had been seen to do in 1955. The persistence of drawing in architecture appeared to Banham ultimately to signify an adherence to \u201ca set of rules of thumb derived from, and entirely proper to, the building arts of the Mediterranean basin alone, and whose master discipline, design, is simply disegno, a style of draughtsmanship once practiced only in central Italy. Reinforcing the field\u2019s classical roots, Banham hazarded a final three part categorization, this time aiming to encompass the totality of architectural produc tion: architecture is from masonry, held together by gravity, and its volumes effec tively closed.\u201d20 To a certain kind of old timer,\u201d Banham continued, \u2018\u2018this could be good news, confirmation that they were right all along and that we should have stuck to the orders and the theory of composition and ignored all that technology and mod ern stuff.\u201d21 Indeed, in Banham\u2019s final, restrictive definition, the more technological exponents of both historical and contemporary building practice were threatened with exclusion from the disciplinary ken: I am increasingly doubtful that the timber buildings of northern Europe, for instance, or the triumphs of Gothic construction, really belong under the rubric of architecture at all. Le Corbusier felt that Gothic cathedrals were \u201cnot very beautiful,\u201d not architecture even, because they were not made of the pure geometrical forms that he found in the buildings of classical Greece and imperial Rome. Current misgivings about high tech, with its exposed structures and services, seem to derive from a similar classicist sentiment.22 What is one to make of Banham\u2019s final deathbed testament? Anthony Vidler has argued that the text represents \u201can admission of defeat in changing \u2018architecture at all during his polemical career, and an expression of respect for such a tenacious tradition.\u201d23 In postulating an architectural object as the projection of a compressive, closed, masonry work by means of a specific drawing technique and an architectural subject as one properly socialized according to an \u201carcane and privileged aesthetic code,\u201d24 Banham\u2019s final definitions are strict and traditional, and they bear scant evidence of the field having been affected by his famous overtures to innovation and technology. The exchange of une architecture autre for an \u201cother\u201d tradition within modern architecture he performed in his late work on High Tech only reinforces Vidler\u2019s assessment, as do the melancholy conclusions of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, The New Brutalism, The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, and Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past, each of which finishes with a recounting of the triumph of tradition and convention over technology and innovation. Nonetheless, glimmers of Banham\u2019s radicalism shine through \u201cA Black Box.\u201d Architecture, while perhaps a tenacious tradition, remained in the essay under threat from both the emergence of computer aided drawing techniques and impending anthropological scrutiny. In addition, Banham\u2019s suggested excision of so much material from architecture\u2019s \u201cintellectual portfolio\u201d\u2014not just northern vernaculars, Gothic cathedrals, and High Tech but also the \u201cZulu kraals, grain elevators, hogans, lunar excursion modules, cruck houses, Farman biplanes and so forth\u201d that had been \u201cco opted\u201d into the architectural canon during the twentieth century25\u2014certainly signaled an act of aggression against proponents of the field\u2019s hegemony over the totality of the building arts. By drawing disciplinary boundaries as tightly as he did \u2014 tightly enough to liberate the design of buildings from the purview of architecture\u2014Banham appears not so much to have capitulated to a \u201ctenacious tradition\u201d as to have offered a way out from under the \u201ccrippling limitation\u201d adherence to the field\u2019s \u201cparochial rule book\u201d had imposed upon \u201cbuilding\u2019s power to serve humanity.\u201d26 This too was a consistent refrain throughout his writing. In Theory and Design, Banham famously suggested that an architect hoping to keep up with technology might have to \u201cdiscard his whole cultural load, including the professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect.\u201d27 In the closing paragraphs of The New Brutalism, he opined that \u201carchitects who genuinely see how narrow and restricting are the traditions of their profession, normally get out of it, and become industrial designers, real eastate [sic] agents, systems engineers and any other discipline that enables them to tangle with the \u2018realities of the situation,\u2019 in a less inhibited manner.\u201d28 Relieving building from responsibilities to architecture and architecture from responsibilities to building, Banham attempted to free the one to better serve the needs of \u201ca world increasingly desperate for better buildings\u201d while allowing the other to \u201cbe recognized as something that belongs as valuably at the heart of western culture as do the Latin language, Christian liturgy, Magna Carta, or\u2014precisely\u2014the Masonic mysteries of Die Zauberflote.\u201d29 Ban ham\u2019s final writings thus echo his persistent call for two alternative trajectories for the field. The first enacted an unapologetic embrace of architecture\u2019s \u201coperational lore,\u201d while the second offered a liberated approach to building committed not to disciplinary tradition but rather to the application of \u201capparent intelligence\u201d to the design and construction of \u201cfit environments for human activities.\u201d30 Radical Convention: Archigram Banham made these themes a central concern of his last completed book, The Visions of Ron Herron, written in 1987 88 and published posthumously in 1994. In it, Banham drew significant attention to the work of this influential member of the Archigram group and, importantly, to the specific disciplinary techniques \u2014 drawing foremost among them\u2014through which Herron produced his work. Projects by Herron and other Archigram members figured strongly in Banham\u2019s writing from the mid 1960s to the end of his career. \u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d (1965) foregrounded themes that would become central to Banham\u2019s writings on High Tech in the 1970s and \u201980s. Later treatments in Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (1976) and in his 1994 monograph drew these tensions into sharp relief. Both books are examined below, but before turning to them, a brief review of the group\u2019s activities and Banham\u2019s earlier treatments of them is in order. As in Banham\u2019s writing, one finds in Archigram a distinct tension between celebrating and lamenting architecture\u2019s dissipation in the face of alternative technological possibilities. And while Archigram\u2019s trajectory suggested an eventual triumph of invisibility over the image, the legacy and impact of the group, as well as the material fact of their output, suggests a different outcome. Many commentators have noticed that Archigram\u2019s seminal imagery of dissipated objects and distracted subjects offered a radical vision of a fundamentally altered architectural milieu. Few, however, have recognized that those very images, executed with a virtuosic command of the field\u2019s standard representational techniques, simultaneously advanced discrete objects and attentive subjects to reinforce, rather than to resist, conventional notions of architectural disciplinarity. Archigram burst onto the international scene in the mid 1960s. The series of radical projects, polemics, publications, and protests generated independently by and through various collaborations between Warren Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, Ron Herron, and Mike \u201cSpider\u201d Webb has since been published widely and has received voluminous commentary.31 Whether praising or panning the group, most commentators have gravitated toward two key themes that resonate throughout the Archigram oeuvre: the emancipation of the leisure subject and the eradication of the architectural object. In 1999, Mike Webb offered a prototypical instance of the approach: Let us now enter the world depicted in one of these drawings: figures suggestive of young, healthy, and hard bodied men and women \u2014 mostly women I have to say \u2014 have been cut out of magazines and pasted on the surface. There is a bovine quality to them. They remind one somewhat of the Eloi in H.G. Wells\u2019 The Time Machine. They are all happy, healthy, and have health insurance bestowed upon them by a beneficent Labour government although they are beginning to look\u2014how shall I put it \u2014 a bit faded, even jaundiced, over the last few years. They probably work no more than a three day week and are undoubtedly \u201cwith it\u201d; a quaint phrase from the sixties that when used today shows the speaker to be anything but. To provide \u201ca backdrop for the activities for [their] bovine friends,\u201d Archigram would pilfer architectural elements from leading figures of the day (Webb cited Buckminster Fuller and Konrad Wachsmann as dependable sources), combine them with their own graphic and verbal musings, and assemble the fragments to \u201cshow how things would look if only planners, governments, and architects were magically able to discard the mental impedimenta of the previous age and embrace the newly developed technologies and their attendant attitudes.\u201d32 Unencumbered by the shackles of convention and the habits of experience, these young architects advanced all manner of technological gadgetry to solve problems previously addressed with buildings. Suitaloon (1967), a wearable membrane designed by Webb, offered a sartorial alternative to traditional brick and mortar construction; Info Gonks (1968), Peter Cook\u2019s premonition of today\u2019s augmented reality glasses, dazzled the eye with supercharged spectacles; and LogPlug and RokPlug (both 1969), by David Greene, smuggled electronic convenience into the great outdoors. Theirs was \u201ca world free of heavy and ponderous buildings that \u2018just get in the way,\u201d\u2019 a world in which \u201carchitecture gets smaller and smaller.\u201d As Webb pointed out, Greene even proposed a \u201cmoratorium on all new building\u201d in 1969.33 In seemingly countless drawings and proposals,34 the Archigram group celebrated swinging youth culture and advocated the dissolution of buildings. Yet the group started out with very different ambitions. The first two issues of their eponymous magazine focused on monumental buildings (mostly student projects) by London\u2019s younger generation. The premier broadsheet emphatically demanded (twice in two pages) that a \u201cnew generation of architecture must arise.\u201d35 Infatuated with the burgeoning space age, the group expressed (with a deliberate nod to Alison and Peter Smithson) a desire \u201cto drag into building some of the poetry of countdown, orbital helmets.\u201d36 Monumental building proposals remained the focus through issue 2, but with the third issue, the group\u2019s interests began to move beyond architectural form toward themes of expendability and global communication, among others 37 By issue 7, Peter Cook famously would proclaim, \u201cThere may be no buildings at all in Archigram 8 \u201d38 And while building proposals would continue to appear in later issues of the pamphlet, their right to be the sole recipient of an architect\u2019s attention and advocacy was challenged (often with tongue firmly in cheek) by increasingly ephemeral events (such as the various Instant City proposals by Cook and Herron, 1968 71) and distributed networks (such as Crompton\u2019s Computor City, 1964) better suited to accommodate and entertain the stylish representatives of youth culture that populated the group\u2019s imagery from the mid 1960s forward.39 Thus, Archigram\u2019s (and Archigram\u2019s) trajectory arcs in a three part transformation from eagle eyed experts rallying a like minded audience in support of a specific vision of monumental architecture to increasingly snarky pundits postulating distracted \u201cbovines\u201d efficiently serviced by their technologically enhanced pastures. Banham\u2019s \u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d40 is the earliest serious study of the Archi gram group and remains a seminal resource. In it, Banham built on the revisionist arguments of his influential Theory and Design in the First Machine Age to provide Archigram with a coherent genealogy of \u201canti formal,\u201d \u201cindeterminate,\u201d and \u201cendless\u201d precedents while using the group to take obvious if sotto voce potshots at the monumental figures and tendencies of orthodox modern architecture.41 Countering a dismissive treatment in Arena,42 Banham next offered \u201cZoom Wave Hits Architecture\u201d in 1966.43 Here, in a widely read national magazine, he praised independent magazines produced at English architecture schools such as Polygon (Regent Street Polytechnic), Megascope (Bristol University), and Clip Kit (Architectural Association), as well as Archigram, for advancing \u201cup to the minute\u201d proposals that countered the \u201cdreary solutions\u201d demanded by the aging faculties at those same institutions.44 Clip Kit drew special applause for its tidy encapsulation of the spirit of the contemporary scene, but, for Banham, \u201cthe reigning champion of protest mags\u201d45 and the standard bearer of the \u201cMovement\u201d was Archigram. While his tone remained panegyric throughout, Banham subtly nudged the young architects toward more aggressive experimentation. If you design right up to the minute, it will be many millions of minutes later before the human race can move in, and the buildings will be out of date by just that time period. Hence the constant preoccupation of the Movement with far out figures like Buckminster Fuller, Yona Friedman or (in Britain) Cedric Price, men who propose not only a more up to the minute environment, but wild technological methods for getting it built quicker and in quantities more nearly commensurate with human needs 46 For Banham, these concerns, combined with an \u201cinsistence on relevance\u201d to contemporary culture, provided the cornerstones of the little magazine project. Aimed at individual human needs rather than at idealistic general solutions, the ideology of the \u201cMovement\u201d offered a means to avoid the leaden profundities that undermined the efforts of more established theoreticians. As he put it, \u201cWe architectural pedagogues are prone to build architecture up into a higher discipline of abstractly ordering the masses about for their own good.\u201d Once again, Banham subtly jibed the humanist tradition and hinted at a means to project alternative subjectivities through architecture. Rather than advancing geometric harnesses that stretch Vit ruvian and Modulor Men alike into idealized configurations, Archigram and other young architects offered loose, flexible, and indeterminate environmental appurtenances that fostered \u201cthe other kind of humanism\u201d in contemporary culture.47 Banham went on to link these ambitions directly to visual imagery: \u201cAdmittedly, the level of relevance is often only that of form fondling, round corner styling, art work and paint jobs. It is more than that, but even if it were purely visual and superficial, that would not in itself be contemptible. It does still matter to people what buildings look like. Indeed it matters more than it did.\u201d48 These passages reveal once more a contradictory tension in Banham\u2019s thinking. On one hand, buildings (or at least \u201cenvironments\u201d) needed to adopt \u201cup to the minute\u201d technology to address as fully as possible contemporary human needs. On the other hand, a deep engagement in the \u201cpurely visual and superficial\u201d had to be maintained to guarantee relevance to contemporary culture. A balance, then, apparently was required to avoid the tendency of such new works of \u201cgoing invisible on us,\u201d of \u201cform following] function into oblivion.\u201d49 For Banham, Archigram's balance of expressive imagery and expedient accommodation offered a provocative model for the discipline. Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past This tension between visual coherence and functional performance also colors Banham\u2019s 1976 book on the megastructure movement. Beyond providing an informative treatment of a body of work that had significant influence on the development of High Tech architecture, Banham provided an extended discussion on the Archigram group in which he gathered important precedents for their activities, traced the history and impact of the Archigram pamphlets, and outlined the group\u2019s imbrications in the short lived megastructure movement. Banham also provided an important account of Constant Nieuwenhuys\u2019s evolving project for New Babylon in which Banham closely aligned Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga\u2019s ideal ludic subject, with the activities of the Situationist International, of which Constant was a member.50 Constant\u2019s proposal illustrated an environment he saw as more conducive to the emergent possibilities the situationists sought through their famous derives and thus more appropriate for the ludic subjects who incited them. New Babylon, he argued, was \u201cthe environment the homo ludens is supposed to live in.\u201d51 Constant\u2019s situationist compatriots were not convinced, and Banham\u2019s explanation of their opposition to Constant\u2019s architectural proposals echoes nearly to the letter criticisms that later would be leveled at Archigram: \u201c[Constant\u2019s] building of actual models only served to excuse the techniciens de la forme architectural, while the attempt to propose actual mechanisms for la vie ludique merely played into the hands of a consumer economy.\u201d52 In a later chapter, \u201cFun and Flexibility,\u201d Banham developed arguments he first made in \u201cA Clip On Architecture.\u201d He addressed the question of the ludic subject in Price\u2019s and Archigram\u2019s work, ultimately distancing the English architects from the strict ideological positions of their situationist counterparts on the Continent, and he highlighted the English contribution to the megastructure movement as the introduction of issues specific to building construction, a move that resulted in a subtle and important conflation of drawing and detailing. Repeating a device he would deploy throughout his career, Banham began by shifting the focus from theory to practice: \u201cLooking back over the first half of the sixties and the characteristic megastructures of the period, it is noticeable \u2014 alarming even \u2014 how few of them offer any nut and bolt proposals as to how the transient elements should be secured to the megaform, or what precise devices and services are required for the playful activities of Homo ludens\u201d Price\u2019s Fun Palace (see pi. 2), by contrast, had been worked out sufficiently to satisfy English building and planning regulations, while Archigram \u201cseemed to be motivated by sheer manic pleasure in proliferating drawings.\" Yet both practices seemed somehow devoid of a specific ideological position. As Banham explained, \u201cThe absence of any explicit ideology was found disturbing, or at least baffling, outside Britain; on the other hand, the presence of detailing was almost universally welcomed, especially in the stunning graphic forms in which Archigram would present it.\u201d53 Banham again left the ideological question hanging and returned to the question of the ludic subject, noting that the Fun Palace was unlikely to offer fully self directed pleasure and thus would not have lived up to Constant\u2019s or the situationists\u2019 radical ambitions. The scale and complexity of the projects components would have necessitated the participation of an expert staff of operators to coordinate the varied activities pursued by the Palace\u2019s occupants and to manipulate the complex array of cranes and equipment that supported the work s indeterminate activities. \u201cThe whole proposition,\u201d he argued, \u201cwould probably have been unacceptable to Constant, and anathema to the hard line Situation 'sts but not unacceptable to someone raised in the tradition of the theatre, nor to English progressive professionals of the Left; neither group would see anything wrong with a little professional backstage assistance to the people\u2019s participatory pleasure out front.\u201d54 Banham noted Buckminster Fuller\u2019s similar willingness to allow individual participation to be mediated by an \u201cexpert staff\u201d in his contemporaneous World Game project before offering his own synopsis of the political situation: \u201cThe Fun Palace team, pragmatists to a man, were not minded to wait for the Revolution to make a perfect palais ludique possible; they would have a practicable Fun Palace here and now, as a way of raising public consciousness to the level where a Revolution might be found to have happened.\u201d55 Like Price\u2019s Fun Palace, Peter Cook\u2019s Plug In City (see pi. 3) undoubtedly would have required a team of trained experts to manage and operate the cranes, trains, and other infrastructural appurtenances that accommodated its inhabitants\u2019 ludic wishes. Indeed, these limitations were noticed by the Archigram members, and throughout the late 1960s, the group began to distance themselves from the megastructure movement. The move was crystallized in a cut out megastructure model kit included in Archigram 7. For Banham, the kit was presented unequivocally as \u201ca joke, a self satire, on the grounds that \u2018everyone can do megastructures now, make your own.\u2019\u201d The message was clear: \u201cmegastructure was now a bore.\u201d56 Moving forward, Archigram turned their attention away from monumental construction toward diminutively scaled individual living units and personal gadgets. In these later works, the immediate satisfaction of \u201cindividual wishes\u201d reigned supreme. Alongside this shift in attention from collective monumentality to individual stimulation\u2014that is, from problems of the image to the promise of increasing invisibility\u2014came a much more emphatic presentation of human figures in Archigram\u2019s drawings. It is only to works dating after about 1966 that Mike Webb\u2019s formulation that \u201cthese figures probably occupy about a quarter of the given surface area of any given page\u201d can be applied accurately.57 As noted above, \u201cthese figures\u201d represented a specific sort of ludic subject. While Webb was to see them as distracted \u201cbovines\u201d in 1999, Banham in 1976 noticed significantly more energy: \u201cIt seemed to be nothing but dolly girls of every race and hue twisting or frugging in their modish miniskirts or striped mini dresses, exclaiming their delight at visiphone messages, relaxing in capsules, while smiling families promenaded the deck spaces, children danced ring a roses, crowds surged before giant images of pop stars on vast eidophore screens; everywhere were sunglasses, freaky hair, wild clothes.\u201d58 Banham went on finally to address Archigram\u2019s deliberate postulation of a ludic subject head on. In a move aiming to insulate Archigram from any specific ideology, he wrote, \u201cI must lay down a firm caveat against making too much of this fun imagery....The presence of all these leisure people in Archigram\u2019s permissive cities is as much an empirical solution to the problem of finding someone\u2014anyone!\u2014to populate them as it is a theoretical proposal for who should populate them.\u201d59 Few would agree with Banham\u2019s assessment, as he himself noted.60 Nigel Whiteley put it bluntly: \u201cThis... is Banham at his least convincing.... The incorporation of a specific type of person did indicate the particular type of environment Archigram wished to create: Archigram were designing a Pop environment for the urban young.\u201d To underline his point, Whiteley appended a quotation from Warren Chalk: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live in Plug In City.... Retired people probably won\u2019t.\u201d61 These passages mark another strange maneuver in Banham\u2019s argumentation. Two years before Megastructure, Banham had turned against attentive appreciation of James Stirling\u2019s clip on visual imagery at the Olivetti Training Center to champion instead a form of distracted subjectivity.62 In the closing paragraphs of \u201cProblem * 3 = Olivetti,\u201d Banham described a disinterested flaneur gliding across Stirling\u2019s ramps blissfully inattentive to the architectural composition and details that surround her (see pi. 8).63 Throughout their later work, Archigram advanced exactly such a subject. Whether \u201ctwisting,\u201d \u201cfrugging,\u201d or just relaxing in \u201cbovine\u201d contentment, the inhabitants of Archigram\u2019s technological environments appear to perform in a manner exactly aligned with Banham\u2019s own vision of an ideal ludic subject, they pay scant attention to the increasingly ephemeral architectures that surround them as they move happily about their business. Indeed, by Archigram 9, architectural con struction had dissipated almost completely into the natural landscape or dreamlike virtuality, and the inhabitants of these new spaces were encouraged to pursue new forms of architectural stimulation beyond their material confines. Yet, though Archigram\u2019s late projects and pamphlets leave little doubt about their reconfigured views of architecture and the new forms of subjectivity they might engender, Ban ham distanced the group from their own rhetoric. At Olivetti, Stirling crafted carefully composed forms and materials to produce an architecture of visual effects steeped in mannerist references and subversions. His was an architecture aimed at attentive and knowing connoisseurs of archi tectural form every bit as intentionally as the Smithsons\u2019 Hunstanton School had been (see pi. i).64 Banham responded with annoyance and argued instead that the strongest effects at Olivetti were felt when the visitor\u2019s attention to detail lapsed into immersive experience. Strangely, when Archigram s projects much more emphatically encouraged just such a distracted mode of engagement, Banham drew attention not just to the group\u2019s images but specifically toward their concept of \u201cjointing.\u201d65 Where Stirling\u2019s actual details had been a source of irritation, Archigram\u2019s images of them were a potent source of architectural interest. Further praising the group for qualities he had disdained in Stirling\u2019s work, Banham went on to align Archigram with a disciplinary tendency to quote and comment. Certain projects, Banham pointed out, were \u201carabesqued with in group jokes about Cedric Price and Buckminster Fuller.\u201d66 Where Archigram\u2019s critics from the mainstream seized the opportunity to cast them as radical reformers, Banham\u2019s comments undercut the radicalism of their propositions and aligned with the charges of traditionalism leveled at them \u2014and at Banham himself\u2014in the same year by Peter Eisenman. Foreclosing the possibility of an \u201cEnglish Revisionist Functionalist\u201d return to bygone modern tendencies, Eisenman argued that modernism in architecture had not yet even occurred. He wrote, \u201cDeriving from a non humanistic attitude toward the relationship of an individual to his physical environment, it [modernism] breaks with the historical past, both with the ways of viewing man as a subject and... with the ethical positivism of form and function. Thus, it cannot be related to functionalism. It is probably for this reason that modernism up to now has not been elaborated in architecture.\u201d67 While modernism had been successfully adopted in painting, literature, and music, it had not developed in architecture because the discipline had yet to engage the \u201cnon objective,\u201d \u201cnon narrative,\u201d and \u201ca temporal\u201d qualities that signaled the movement's fundamental condition: \u201ca displacement of man away from the center of his world.\u201d68 To finally bring about architectural modernism, Eisenman argued for the abandonment of the form/function dialectic (and its outmoded humanism) in favor of a \u201cnew, modern dialectic\u201d of \u201ctransformation\u201d and \u201cdecomposition\u201d located \u201cwithin the evolution of form itself.\u201d69 Such radicalism, more appropriate to the postmodern discourse of the 1970s and \u201980s, was not to be found in the Archigram oeuvre. Peter Cook affirmed the group\u2019s interest in core disciplinary values in a 2008 interview: Q: A common opinion of Archigram is that the group was trying to dissolve architecture or break it down. Peter Cook: I never felt that. I always felt that we were trying to revive architecture via a pruning process, to extend the vocabulary by showing that architecture could be more than this. It could be that, it could appropriate\u2014 It can very easily be argued that in the twentieth century, and probably before that, architecture was always appropriating stuff from the art world. Q: The work seems much more interested in the center of the discipline than in the periphery. It is mining the periphery for raw materials to bring back to the center. PC: To bring back to the center. That\u2019s my view. Now, if you talk to somebody else, you might get a slightly different view of it.70 Mike Webb offered similar sentiments in 1999: \u201cAn architectural drawing is without doubt what its author, the young master, understood himself to be making....The drawing was never intended to be a window through which the world of tomorrow could be viewed but rather as a representation of a hypothetical physical envi \u201d71 ronment made manifest simultaneously with its two dimensional paper proxy. Banham, then, offered an accurate portrayal of the group\u2019s own ambitions and ideo logical stance. Archigram unequivocally directed their work at their peers within the field of architecture, an audience steeped in disciplinary convention and con ditioned to pay attention not just to a drawing's content but also to the technical processes involved in its production. While their images may have depicted leisure subjects in varying states of distracted contentment, in presenting meticulously crafted and pun laden artifacts specifically to architects, Archigram encouraged the deep attention and focus of knowledgeable connoisseurs, a move that ultimately reinforced rather than resisted conventional disciplinarity. Theirs was not a project of radical subversion but rather one of mischievous prodding, the work of preco cious masters deeply committed to their field but dismayed by a state of pervasive lassitude among their elders. Ultimately and unequivocally, Archigram saw their work as a continuation of the field\u2019s core activities \u2014 activities, it is often forgotten, that only sometimes play out on the construction site but always and more fundamentally unfold on the drafting table and, more recently, on the computer screen. Though they undoubtedly altered the cut and color with a stylish infusion of pop materials and methods, each member of Archigram was, throughout the 1960s and the ensuing decades, proudly clad in \u201cthe professional garments by which he is identified as an architect.\u201d72 The Visions of Ron Herron Banham reinforced this assessment of Archigram\u2019s commitment to conventional disciplinarity in The Visions of Ron Herron. As with \"A Black Box\u201d and \u201cActual Monuments,\u201d Banham completed the text during the final stages of his illness. Like the two late essays, this little examined text focuses on core disciplinary questions. In contrast to many commentators, who place work by Archigram members at the fringes of the field, Banham located Herron\u2019s output at its very center. According to Banham, Herron was engaged in a perennial task of the discipline: \u201cto transmute the stuff of technology into the matter of architecture.\u201d73 This engagement took place not so much through building, though Herron\u2019s practice had authored several impressive ones, but rather through architectural drawings, which Banham saw as bona fide works of architecture in their own right. Coupled with descriptions of key projects by the Herron office that undermine the stable architectural subjects and objects Banham had articulated in \"A Black Box,\u201d this attitude toward drawing suggested the possibility of works that, while produced through distinctly conventional methods, moved resolutely away from the traditionalism in evidence in his other late writings. Banham began by articulating the strange conventionality of Herron\u2019s supposedly iconoclastic work. [Herron\u2019s sketches] rarely seem to imply anything more than conventional current technologies of equipment and construction, bricolated together with off the shelf componentry\u2014though not always from the world of regular architecture. And that too should come as no great surprise, since Herron\u2019s whole output is somewhat at variance with the world of regular architecture. Paradoxically though, there can be no nonsense about him not being an architect. He is not a structural nor a systems engineer; in spite of his knowledge of both areas; he is not a computer whizz [sic], nor even a hacker, though few living architects are quite so computer friendly. He is in himself, and in his generation entirely at home in the world of current technology, yet always and entirely an architect. He knows exactly what he is after when he goes round invading the professional turfs of adjacent specializations (or even remote ones), but when he returns from these forays of design piracy he does not appear bent over and burdened down, as were the Machine Aesthetes of the 1920s, with the weight and importance of the loot he has acquired. He still occupies his usual professional posture. He never ceases to think and design like an architect, so that if his projects appear strange, they are no more than strange, rather than alien or threatening, to other architects, and the excitement he derives from these forays is communicable to other architects by purely architectural means \u2014or drawings, as they are more usually called.74 Banham was relentless in his alignment of Herron\u2019s working method with conventional disciplinary techniques. He continued: \u201cThe techniques of capture and domestication for architectural purposes, are entirely conventional, not to say traditional \u2014a Pentel R50 ballpen, Magic Markers, all that kind of familiar stuff. Only a little material is collaged in as found; the historical method of architectural recording\u2014disegno, dessin, tekening, zeichnung [sic], drawing\u2014is employed, and even his electronic outputs are computer graphics, right?\u201d75 These extended passages are set down here verbatim not just in submission to the stubborn resistance of Banham\u2019s prose to adequate paraphrase but also to demonstrate their author\u2019s emphatic explication of traditional disciplinary values and techniques at the base of Herron\u2019s output. In moving on to trace specific trends in the architect\u2019s approach, Banham further linked seemingly extradisciplinary tactics to venerated canonical precedents. Herron\u2019s Lyric Theater at Hammersmith (1982) and British Telecom Mobile Exhibition Structure (also known as the Telecom Slug, 1985 89) (figs. 6.1, 6.2), for example, both feature brash juxtapositions of rigid frames and pneumatic FIG. 6.1 Ron Herron (British, 1930 94).

Sketches. membranes reminiscent of clip on. Nonetheless, Banham highlighted their formal affiliation to modern movement icons such as Le Corbusier and Charlotte Perriand\u2019s Grand Confort armchair and a genealogy of antecedents stretching back to Auguste Perret, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Eugene Emmanuel Viollet le Duc.76 At the same time, Banham was careful not simply to rehearse established opinions. Discussing Herron\u2019s Walking City (see pi. 17), Banham attempted to diffuse fearful condemnations that appeared in its wake as he encapsulated the work\u2019s distance from orthodox modern architecture, its disregard for outmoded conventions, its simultaneous adherence to modernist principles, and its alignment with the renovated humanism he had championed throughout his career: What got crushed under the mighty feet of this stalking vision was not \u201chumanity\u201d but the empty claims of the \u201cfunctionalism\u201d that had once been the driving energy of modern architecture, but had since become a paralyzing inertia in the hands of academics and the establishments. The old libidinous mechanical kraken of Modernism had re awakened and raised itself from the placid waters of the dead sea of current architecture, and the panic was on. Had the panicked hung around a bit, they would also have seen that marvelous, witty and life enhancing later drawing of four or five walking cities gathered together in friendly interlinked discourse (fig. 6.B).77 Banham found a similar set of seemingly contradictory affiliations in Herron\u2019s Suburban Sets, elaborated, in collaboration with his son, Andrew, from Archigram\u2019s Monaco Underground project in a series of iterations throughout the 1970s and \u201980s fig. 6.3 Ron Herron (British, 1930 94). Walking City (1964). Sketch. (figs. 6.4, 6.5). In them, Herron combined anonymous vernacular street facades with customized domestic and entertainment elements to support\u2014from telltale Archigram space frames\u2014any number of lifestyle possibilities, as well as individual occupants ranging from typically \u201cwith it\u201d ludic subjects to the Queen of England. To Banham, the situation was perplexing: \u201cHow can one explain, even to the Brits, that\u2014yes\u2014it is possible for a supposedly radical architect to accept at face value the \u2018Castles on the Ground\u2019 of bourgeois suburbia, and their presiding genius, the irretrievably bourgeois House of Windsor, with its polo ponies and corgis.\u201d78 To answer his own question, Banham pointed to a deconstructive ambition lurking at the heart of Herron\u2019s playful musings: \u201cOne valid (but never exclusive nor exhaustive) reading of his Suburban Sets is the undermining of suburbia from within and by its own implicit value system.\u201d True to his pragmatist leanings, Banham found the fulcrum of Herron\u2019s critique not in theoretical concepts but rather in practical tectonics: \u201cThe inner contradiction that will destroy suburbia as we know it has nothing to do with Marxist theory and a great deal to do with, e.g., picture windows.\u201d Where conventional wisdom has it that picture windows existed so that occupants may see out, Herron (and Banham) understood that their more important function was to allow others to see in, to reveal the individual subjects lurking behind the anonymous suburban facades. The situation was taken to an extreme in the Suburban Sets: \u201cAll those backyard secrets, all that illusionistic gismology, all those gazebos and grounded 747s, floodlit fountains and electronic tomatoes must, sooner or later, come bursting through the fapade into public view...and their flaunting will blow the cover off all the latter day Mr Pooters (who may include Mr Herron) who thought they could have your secret and eat it, so to speak.\u201d79 fig. 6.4 Ron and Andrew Herron (Ron Herron, British, 1930 94; Andrew Herron, British). Suburban Sets (1974). Isometric and section. fig. 6.5 Ron and Andrew Herron (Ron Herron, British, 1930 94; Andrew Herron, British). Suburban Sets (1974). Interior collage. If Herrons suburban visions threatened to \u201cblow the cover off\u201d conventions suburban subjectivity, his Telecom Slug (see figs. 6.1, 6.2) appeared to Banham poised to undermine the stable formations that constituted a conventional architectural object. Herron\u2019s unrealized project was designed to house a traveling exhibition for British Telecom. As in the Suburban Sets, Herron exploited a set of contradictory affiliations with varied building technologies. The Slug\u2019s structura system a cavernous PVC coated fabric inflatable lashed with steel cables with a grid of space frame towers\u2014wore its redundancy on its sleeve, with tensile sup ports visually (and only sometimes actually) pulling at a fabric structure that, du to internal air pressure, was already in tension.80 The visual contradiction in struc ture was compounded by the building\u2019s similarly expedient solution to the prob lem of demountable and transportable construction. The Slug was designed to s on a cast in place concrete slab \u2014 a new slab was to be poured at each installatio in preparation for the arrival on site of the rest of the Slug\u2019s components. Redun dant building elements and installation crews would leapfrog from site to site, eac iteration of the Slug would involve a different combination of new and reused e'e ments. Herron thus proposed an architecture that could not be defined fully W* reference to a specific location or a finite collection of material components. In this, one may notice a curious parallel with Peter Eisenman\u2019s elevation of \u2018'process concurrent writings: \u201cThe order or nature of the object now resides in that process which constitutes its differences...it is a nature now grounded in process, not in being; it is no longer based on the substance of the object... the object is no longer identical with its substance.\u201d81 But where Eisenman developed a new architectural ontology in the collapse of the formal aspects of an object into the conceptual pro cesses of design, Herron did so by conflating the material and temporal aspects of building construction. The Slug would have been articulated as much by specific material assemblies as by the designation of an event\u2014as with the fleet of aircraft that trade compo nents and the appellation \u201cAir Force One\u201d based on the presence of a specific occu pant, or the Grateful Dead\u2019s \u201cWall of Sound,\u201d a collection of redundant sound stage equipment that leapfrogged from venue to venue during the band\u2019s tours in the mid 1970s. Along a similar vein, while one Telecom Slug was up and running, other components would be in varying states of assembly, disassembly, reconfiguration, and transportation in anticipation of a future deployment. Banham described the complex ontology of such an object: At the level where one begins to visualize the logistics of managing and moving such an object as the Slug\u2014the size of a small cathedral, remember \u2014 systems thinking begins to have a curiously solvent effect on established architectural concepts like \u201ca building.\u201d The Slug may well have to be two Slugs, or two and some vulgar fraction Slugs, if it is to satisfy the programmed requirements of actually having one Slug on site for all of the times per annum that its operational calendar stipulates.82 Yet, in characteristic fashion, Banham quickly reinscribed the Slug\u2019s bold challenge to traditional understandings of architectural objects into the core workings of the field: \u201cWhether Ron Herron stops any longer to make distinctions between designing buildings, or near buildings, or kits that periodically add up to quasi buildings, or whatever; I very much doubt, but every so often he comes up with something like the Slug which seems light years away from what one commonly considers to be a building\u2014and, dammit! the thing is still architecture.\u201d83 Complicating the Slug\u2019s relation to core disciplinary values was the fact that Herron developed the work with the aid of computers, which placed the subversive object at odds with traditional drawing. Herron\u2019s use of computer aided design \u2014at the time a technology still in its infancy \u2014prompted Banham to offer a final commentary on \u201cDigital Design.\u201d This short section is a valuable rumination of the pressures applied by digital techniques to both architectural objects as well as the subjects that produce those objects. Tallying the advantages of computer aided techniques, Banham noted the now obvious fact that they allow architects to \u201cmonitor the effects of re design almost instantaneously, and can go on accumulating revision without sweating blood. More importantly, they can do it without generating labour intensive works of art that are too hard won to discard; the basic image in the computer program is always there somewhere in digital storage, and can be summoned back at the clack of a couple of keys.\u201d84 Its author\u2019s naive faith in undo buffers notwithstanding, the passage marks yet another important dissipation of architecture. If the Suburban Sets worked to undermine stable forms of suburban domesticity and the Telecom Slug\u2019s inherent multiplicity challenged the stable ontology of the architectural object, here, the architectural drawing itself, the very element with which Banham began the book, was threatened by a new technology. No longer bound to the physical artifacts produced through painstaking drawing, the act of designing was now recorded in ephemeral traces on the computer monitor. In another passage eerily resonant with contemporary digital design discourse and production, Banham praised Herron and his office for having \u201cthe sort of audacity to think in terms of presenting one of their projects as the architectural equivalent of a music video.\u201d85 Like the Sets and the Slug, the video, exhibited at the 1986 exhibition Vision der Moderne, pushed architectural thinking well beyond the traditional artifacts generated through drawing and building.86 At the same time, it challenged the received notions of the subjectivity of the architect. For Banham: Its all jolly Post Modern, not in the routine \u201cLook Mum l can do Palladian Windows\u201d architectural manner, but in the \u201cModes of Discourse about Discourse\u201d manner that had lately engaged the minds of heavier than architectural thinkers in academe. Like a Post Modern novelist abandoning the Almighty Author stance of traditional writers in favour of the more mod est Untrustworthy Narrator posture of the writer who is part of his own fiction, Ron Herron presents himself in the video as part of his own design project, far more convincingly than does, say, James Stirling in the famous perspectives of his own Olivetti Milton Keynes project. For, where the draftsmanly convention of Rob Krier\u2019s [sic]87 drawings of and for Stirling cannot but present Big Jim as the Almighty Architect of tradition, Ron Herron, speaking in propria voce from the overgrown private garden behind his own computer simulation, presents himself as a user friendly illusion just like you or me (only without making a big deal out of it, like some novelist hung up on \u201cnarratology\u201d). The architect who has always been metaphorically at home with technology, here \u2014 thanks to his personal computer appears as a mean sensual man who is literally at home in technology. And, perhaps, in that flourishing backyard that is real despite the graphic illusions of robot domesticity by which we have come at it, he can begin to discern for us that elusive essence of technology that technologists cannot elucidate\u2014without ever ceasing to be the architect he has always been.88 In the end, Banham offered a vision of architecture dissipated into the flux of digital design and the architect absorbed into the virtual ether of his illusory animations. And while such iconoclastic work tore at the heart of received conventions \u2014 indeed it had \u201clittle to do with the ancient vocabularies of disegno\u201d \u2014 and distinctly intertwined the subjectivity of the architect with the objective (if virtual) realities he or she created, the architecture remained undeniably real, and its designer remained unequivocally an architect. For while \u201cthe software names will mostly fade from importance, the endeavor that bends them to the architectural will can never fade, however \u2014not while architecture persists, not while architects like Ron Herron persist in making architecture.\u201d89 Expanding on his important late career concept,90 Banham explained that making architecture did not necessarily involve the act of building but rather the \u201crevelation of truth,\u201d an idea he gleaned from Martin Heidegger\u2019s essay \u201cThe Question Concerning Technology.\u201d91 As Banham put it, \u201cAll the breakthroughs toward an architecture of technology have been, in a literal sense, revelations\u2014of how to make architecture, that pure creation of the human spirit, out of concrete, or steel, or glass, or whatever. And each revelation that has comprehended or uncovered an essence\u2014the Villa Savoye, the Farnsworth House, just as much as the Pantheon or La Sainte Chapelle\u2014has been a truth out of which architects can make architecture.\u201d Further, \u201cNot all such revelations have to be buildings. They could be a paragraph from Ruskin\u2019s Stones of Venice, or Geoffrey Scott\u2019s Architecture of Humanism, or even Asimov\u2019s Caves of Steel.\u201d Banham continued: But, then, the work of the architect as he bends over the paper, pencil in hand, is all illusion. He produces simulacra of reality, diagrams which, by some form of sympathetic magic, are supposed to cause real buildings to happen out in the instrumental world. We all know that it is not sympathetic magic but a vast and frequently fallible industrial complex that will turn the illusory vision into real construction but, for architects, the moment of magic, the revelation of truth, is when pencil marks the paper, and the process of making architecture begins.92 Even the title of the chapter from which these lines are quoted, \u201cOutlines of Real Illusions,\u201d reinforced Banham\u2019s claim that all of architecture\u2019s artifacts, whether drawn, animated, written, or built, are each equally and undeniably real. Herron\u2019s drawings, though perhaps \u201csimulacra of reality,\u201d fundamentally are not mere representations of buildings. Rather, they are instantiations of Banham\u2019s earlier concept of \u201carchitecture as \u2018an image.\u2019\u201d93 Herron\u2019s images demonstrate that, for Banham, architecture is less a matter of constructed buildings than of applied technique, and the sense of conviction they convey, as Banham made clear in his late writings, confirms that some of the field\u2019s most important achievements have been realized not in the realm of building construction but rather in the production of architecture beyond building.

Sir Christopher Wren (1632 1723) was educated at Oxford University and was a founding member of the Royal Society. An accomplished polymath and self trained architect, he designed St. Paul s Cathedral in London (completed in 1711) and oversaw the reconstruction of over fifty London parish churches after the Great Fire of 1666. Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661 1736) began his career as Wren\u2019s personal clerk, worked as an assistant on St. Paul\u2019s, and authored some of the most celebrated of the London parish churches, including St. Mary Woolnoth (completed in 1727), Christ Church Spitalfields (1729). and St Georges, Bloomsbury (1730). 11 Banham, \u201cA Black Box,\u201d 293.

Their first monograph, Peter Cook, ed., Archigram (London: Studio Vista, 1970, reissued by Princeton Architectural Press, 1999), republished much of the written and graphic material from the original Archigram pamphlets as well as extended presentations of projects by group members. Other important presentations include Priscilla Chapman, \u201cThe Plug In City,\u201d The Sunday Times Colour Supplement, 20 September 1964, 28 33; Peter Cook, \"Archigram Group, London, A Chronological Survey,\u201d Architectural Design 35 (1965): 559 73; and \u201cAmazing Archigram: A Supplement,\u201d Perspecta 11 (1967): 131 54. In the 1990s, group members participated in the design and execution of the traveling exhibition Archigram: Experimental Architecture, 1961 74 and its attendant catalogs. See Alain Guiheux, ed., Archigram (Paris: Editions du Centre Georges Pompidou, 1994); Dennis Crompton, ed., A Guide to Archigram: 1961 74 (London: Academy, 1994); Dennis Crompton, ed.. Concerning Archigram (London: Archigram Archives, 1998); and Dennis Crompton, ed., Archigram: Experimental Architecture, 1961 1974 (Tokyo: PIE, 2005). The latter reproduces selected pages of the original Archigram pamphlets as inserts within the catalog. Editorial pieces by group members were regular occurrences in the pages of Architectural Design, Arena, AA Quarterly, and elsewhere from 1965 onward. More recently, two excellent monographic studies have appeared. See Simon Sadler, Archigram: Architecture without Architecture (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2005); and Hadas Steiner, Archigram: The Structure of Circulation (London: Routledge, 2008). Curiously, the Archigram pamphlets, which the group published at irregular intervals from 1961 to 1974, have received scant attention. Steiner\u2019s book is among a growing number of recent texts that have attempted a sustained treatment of the pamphlets. Sarah Deyong gives a useful summary of them (concentrating on the Archigram group\u2019s affiliations with the megastructure movement) in \"The Creative Simulacrum in Architecture: Megastructure, 1953 1972\u201d (PhD diss., Princeton University, 2008), 49 60. My own writings on the Archigrams include Todd Gannon, \u201cReturn of the Living Dead: Archigram and Architecture\u2019s Monstrous Media,\" Log 13/14 (2008), 171 80; and Todd Gannon and N.

Bradley Horn (Barcelona: Loft, 2010), 58 71 Several ideas in the present chapter first appeared, in a different form, in these two essays. 32 Mike Webb, \u201cBoys at Heart,\u201d in Cook, Archigram, 2. 33 Webb, \u201cBoys at Heart,\u201d 3. 34 In fact, the drawings have been counted, as well as cataloged, systematically archived, and made available in digital facsimile by researchers at the University of Westminster. See the Archigram Archival Project (AAP), launched in April 2010: http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/the archigram archival project.html. 35 Archigram Paper One (1961): cover sheet and main page. 36 Archigram Paper One, cover sheet. The lines were written by David Greene. 37 This shift in editorial focus immediately followed a 1962 lecture by John McHale at the London Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA). \u201cThe Plastic Parthenon\u201d outlined nearly all of the major themes to be taken up in subsequent issues of Archigram. Given their close ties to the ICA at the time, it is likely that at least some of the members of the Archigram group were in attendance. Regardless of their presence, the period immediately following McHale\u2019s lecture marked a notable shift in the Archigram pamphlets, as their concern migrated from the promotion of projects by the younger generation to the elaboration of specific themes \u2014all of them developed in McHale's talk\u2014such as expendability (issue 3,1963), science fiction (issue 4,1964), individual living pods (issue 7,1966), and nomads (issue 8,1968). McHale developed the lecture from his 1959 essay \u201cThe Expendable Ikon 1,\u201d Architectural Design 22, no. 2 (1959): 82 83; and \u201cThe Expendable Ikon 2Architectural Design 22, no. 3 (1959): 116 17. A text version of McHale\u2019s \u201cThe Plastic Parthenon\u201d appeared in Gillo Dorfles, ed., Kitsch: The World of Bad Taste (New York: Bell, 1969), 98 110. In \u201cRecycling Recycling,\u201d Mark Wigley provides an important commentary on McHale: see Amerigo Marras, ed., Eco Tec: Architecture of the In Between (New York: Princeton Architectural, 1999), 38 49. Sarah Deyong attributes Archigram\u2019s shift in editorial focus to the influence of Banham, who had opined on expendability in \u201cA Throw Away Aesthetic\u201d [written 1955, originally published as \u201cIndustrial Design and Popular Art,\u201d Industrial Design 7 (March 1960): 45 58] in Reyner Banham, Design by Choice, ed. Penny Sparke (New York: Rizzoli, 1981), 90 93. See Deyong, \u201cThe Creative Simulacrum,\u201d 53. Given the group\u2019s commitment to monumentality in the issues that appeared immediately after Banham\u2019s essay, McHale\u2019s talk seems the more likely instigator of the shift. 38 Peter Cook, \u201cA Very Straight Description,\u201d Archigram 7 (1966): n.p. (Archigram Archival Project, Insert 9/2). 39 The human figures that became a fixture in later Archigram images are rare in the pamphlets themselves. The inability economically to reproduce images cut from color magazines undoubtedly influenced their absence. The group\u2019s telltale female figures first appear hand drawn in Warren Chalk\u2019s 1964 Capsule Homes project. The earliest collaged female figure (black and white) appears in Peter Cook\u2019s Plug In Mews scheme of 1965. After 1966, the technique became increasingly common in Archigram projects. The technique was not unprecedented. The Smithsons had included collaged images of celebrities, including James Dean, Joe DiMaggio, and Marilyn Monroe in their well known 1952 perspectives of Golden Lane (see fig. 1.14). 40 See Reyner Banham, \u201cA Clip On Architecture,\" Design Quarterly 63 (1965): entire issue. 41 For a discussion, see \u201cUnconventional Combinations: A Clip On Architecture,\u201d this volume. 42 See Francis Duffy, ed., \u201cSome Notes on Archigram,\u201d Arena: The Architectural Association Journal 82 (June 1966): 171 72. 43 Reyner Banham, \u201cZoom Wave Hits Architecture,\" New Society 7, no. 179 (1966): 21, reprinted in Banham, Design by Choice, 64 65. 44 For an excellent study of the independent magazines of the period, see Beatriz Colomina and Craig Buckley, eds., Clip/Stamp/Fold: The Radical Architecture of Little Magazines, t96x to 197X (Barcelona: Actar, 2010). 45 Banham, \u201cZoom Wave,\u201d 64. 46 For this quote and the subsequent one, see Banham, \u201cZoom Wave,\u201d 65. 47 Reyner Banham, \u201cThe History of the Immediate Future,\u201d RIBA Journal 68, no. 7 (1961): 256. 48 Banham, \u201cZoom Wave,\u201d 65, emphasis in the original. 49 Banham, \u201cA Clip On Architecture,\u201d 30. 50 On New Babylon, see Constant [Nieuwenhuys], \u201cNew Babylon: An Urbanism for the Future,\u201d Architectural Design 34 (1964): 304 5; and Mark Wigley, Constant's New Babylon: The Hyper Architecture of Desire (Rotterdam: 010,1999).

WF CONCLUSION 'n spite of his late career decoupling of architecture from building, throughout his career, Banhatn often railed against what he saw as the field s inadequate a e ness to architecture\u2019s role in the production of the built environment n i * example, he wrote: \u201cThe pity of it is that so much of this academic e a e matters which are marginal and trivial to the important business os, . I hut are matters suitable tor better housed, better serviced, better symbolize academic debate.\u201d1 , QCC;nd it This admonition, a typical example of his opinion and manner o expr . came in an article on Norman Foster\u2019s Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters ( P \u25a0 1974) (figs. 74 7.4; see fig. 4.10, pis. 18 20). In his unfinished book^ ^ ^ ham located the project in the category of \u201cThe Opposite a, exPosed subscribe to High Tech\u2019s distinctive monumentality of exposed ^ services, and bold colors; rather, they were conceived as subdued g as* \u00b0 ^ cent of their structural and functional workings.2 Banham often \u201e art sheds\u201d with hostility. Recall, for example, his dismissive remarks on modi le sm 3 in \"Art and Necessity\u201d and The Architecture of the Well Tempe'ed^ n\u2122\u00b0^ h's position was markedly ambivalent. \u201cThe Opposite ase international allegiance to what Banham saw as the outmoded visual t \u201e4 |n Style but also appeared to \u201cprefigure an even higher form of H'g ^ ^ burgeon writing of the recent crop of corporate facilities constructed ^ \u201cbetter than ing computer culture of Silicon Valley, Banham labeled the group ^ Ggns|er respectable body of architecture\u201d and applauded corporate we|| serviced, Associates and Hawley & Peterson Architects for coupling pleasant, w 0Pen plan work environments with coherent visual imagery.5 ^ ^ normally While Banham\u2019s visit to Silicon Valley appears to hav , jn \u201cSilicon aggressive stance on anachronistic affiliations with the Internationa Foster Associates (Norman Foster, British, b. 1935) Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters (Ipswich, England, 1974) Facade (detail).

Style,\u201d it was not to the buildings themselves but rather to their distinctive landscap ing that Banham devoted the bulk of his attention. \u201cBy their bush work shall ye know them,\u201d he churlishly intoned. \u201cFrom the start, the historical development of the valley\u2019s corporate vision has been measured in shrubs and trees.\u201d6 Many of these projects pushed landscape design well beyond the fastidious cultivation of planted areas adjacent to the building proper. At Hawley & Peterson\u2019s Qume Headquarters (San Jose, California, 1980), for example, planting was internalized to become a major element of the interior milieu, while at the Dysan Corporation Headquarters (Santa Clara, California, 1980), the building was nestled into the earth to engender a more thorough conflation of interior and exterior. Banham expressed a measure of dismay at this occlusion of architectural objects with planting and earthwork, and he closed by suggesting the possibility of a renewed appreciation of the corporate glass box shorn of its verdant disguise: \u201cWhatever the present preoccupation with external imagery and cosmetic shrubbery, it will need only a slight shift of corporate vision for the basic box to be found admirable for its simplicity and for Digital and IBM Santa Teresa to be praised for their naked honesty. For the moment, though, fig leaves are in, full frontal industrial nudity is out, and... how green is our Silicon Valley!\u201d7 Working in close collaboration with corporate leaders, Norman Foster had offered a potent example of just such a shift in vision seven years earlier at Willis Faber. But where Banham, in the passage quoted above and throughout the 1970s and \u201980s, had praised works that aligned with his late career valuation of clarity, honesty, and unity, Foster\u2019s project systematically flouted the historian\u2019s categorizations and stubbornly resisted affiliation with any of the stylistic idioms Banham had advanced during his career. Refusing the New Brutalism\u2019s coherent imagery and clip on\u2019s \u201cunity of effect,\u201d at Willis Faber, Foster offered a dizzying melange of reflected architectural incident on the building\u2019s mirror glass facade (see pis. 18, 19). Where exposed services and structure signaled clear and honest expression for New Brutalist, clip on, and High Tech works, Foster answered with an exterior that effaced tectonic expression and interior spaces that betrayed nothing of the environmental and communication technologies at work beyond their raised floors and suspended ceilings (see fig. 7.3). As found materials and off the peg components similarly were avoided. Foster\u2019s team developed custom fabricated building assemblies such as the work\u2019s unprecedented glass skin,8 one off interior ceiling system, and fenestrated escalators. Of the nine architectural qualities Banham articulated for the New Brutalism, clip on, and High Tech (see table 1, p. 154), Foster\u2019s work exhibited just one \u2014 bold colors\u2014but even this was limited to interior finish systems such as floor coverings. Further, and unlike other \u201csmart sheds\u201d Banham used to indicate High Tech\u2019s \u201cOpposite Case,\u201d Willis Faber did not offer much in the way of enhanced environmental performance,9 nor did it align with Alfred Barr\u2019s triple formula for the International Style. Its volumes are not planar but bulbous, its massing is far from regular, and its glass surfaces, while unadorned, are replete with fragmented contextual reflections by day and revealed interior incident by night \u2014 a far cry from Barr\u2019s canonical blankness. Banham\u2019s modern traits of clarity, honesty, and unity are likewise in short supply, with obscurity, dissimulation, and what Banham termed \u201ca nicely judged eclecticism\u201d much more readily at hand.10 While these latter qualities soon would be associated with flagship examples of architectural postmodernism, it would be difficult, given the building\u2019s earnest functionality and lack of overt referentiality, to argue convincingly for alignment with that style. Rather, Willis Faber stands as a defiant catalog of exclusions: neither New Brutalist nor clip on nor High Tech; neither International Style nor modern nor postmodern. Further, boasting as it does a suspended glass facade, cantilevered floor slabs, and vast open plan interiors, Willis Faber flaunted the final set of criteria Banham offered in \u201cA Black Box\u201d: the building is neither masonry nor compressive nor closed. By Ban ham\u2019s final definition, Foster\u2019s building is not even architecture at all. If Ron Herron\u2019s career heralded the possibility of architecture beyond building, with Willis Faber, Foster took the opposite approach to deliver a mode of building beyond architecture. Though there is ample evidence of architectural intelligence on display, there is little celebration of architecture as such at Willis Faber. Writing in the Architectural Review, Christopher Woodward pointed out that the designers were unwilling \u201cformally to monumentalize any one of the main elements of the building, neither structure, services, nor the usual paraphernalia of modules.\u201d11 Ban ham, for his part, described how the secondary structure of the exterior glazing \u201chas been refined away almost, but not quite, to nothing, a clamp bar to hang the glass from at the top, and a patch plate at each corner where the four plates meet. Otherwise, there is nothing except a translucent line of sealant between each sheet [of glass] and the next, optically lost in the inevitable refractions and reflections that occur at any cut edge of glass.\u201d12 And as architectural interest was effaced at the level of the details, so too did it dissipate as one moved through the building. Ban ham explained: \u201cThe rising plane of the escalator through the generous central light well makes one look at, and think about other matters. It is a building to be explored before it is understood, and for this reason its levels of technology, servicing, and energy consumption are not to be read by snap judgment or any single viewpoint.\u201d13 As was the case at James Stirling\u2019s Olivetti Training Center and Richard Rogers\u2019s building for Lloyd\u2019s of London, Banham the detail connoisseur gave way here to Banham the flaneur. Moving around the facility\u2019s undulating perimeter, one does not encounter an emphatic architectural object but rather a reflected and refracted re presentation of its immediate context (see pis. 18,19). And if the exterior morphs into a cinematic display of virtual images animated by the roving eye of the mobile observer, moving within only amplifies the project\u2019s promiscuous slide toward adjacent fields of disciplinary expertise. For the \u201cother matters\u201d one is compelled to look at and think about on the \u201crising plane of the escalator\u201d are not architectural in the least. Rather, one glides through two expansive levels of interior furnishings before being deposited at the top upon a fastidiously clipped and seemingly limitless lawn (see fig. 7.4, pi. 20). The effect is at once disarmingly pleasant and shocking. At no point along this sequence from urban street through corporate interior to bucolic park does one find anything even remotely monumental in the conventional architectural sense. Instead, the building effectively melts away, and a visitor encounters no architecture at all. Willis Faber & Dumas is nothing but interior and landscape. The Opposite Case This slouch into adjacent design fields betrays an unlikely allegiance at the heart of the building\u2019s conception. For while Willis Faber\u2019s unsettling effects spurn affiliation with progressive architectural movements from the 1930s to the \u201970s, they distinctly resonate with a body of English architectural thought that had been disdained by forward thinking young architects from the 1950s to the \u201970s \u2014 that is, Townscape.14 If Sigfried Giedion\u2019s \u201cNine Points on Monumentality\u201d provided Banham with an unlikely template for the design of Centre Georges Pompidou,15 Gordon Cullen provided an eerie premonition of the design tactics Foster employed at Willis Faber with his \u201cTownscape Casebook\u201d (i949) 16 In the building, Foster evaded Banham\u2019s nine stylistic traits for the New Brutalism, clip on, and High Tech as well as the nine additional qualities Banham associated with the International Style, modern architecture, and architecture as such. By contrast, he neatly aligned Willis Faber with all forty qualities Cullen advocated in the \u201cCasebook.\u201d \u201cScreened Vistas\u201d abound along the building\u2019s perimeter, while a \u201cGrandiose Vista\u201d is delivered as instructed \u201cfrom the air\u201d at the culmination of the escalator trip to the upper lawn. Here, a minimal guardrail, low parapet, and slight mounding of the outlying turf conspire to transform the building edge into a picturesque ha ha. Uninterrupted by a visual boundary, the rooftop expanse of turf collapses seamlessly into the aggressively flat landscape of surrounding Suffolk (see figs. 7.3, 7.4). \u201cNetted Sky\u201d is provided to the lower floors through the open atrium, while the drama of \u201cEnclosure\u201d and \u201cExposure\u201d plays out through the entry sequence. In an uncanny resonance with Cullen\u2019s sketches (fig. 7.5), Willis Faber perfectly choreographs a \u201cFree Development\u201d of juxtaposed historical elements on its undulating perimeter.17 \u201cIncident,\u201d \u201cUndulation,\u201d and \u201cFlowing Lines\u201d all amply are employed, and directives toward \u201cMultiple Use,\u201d \u201cRoofscape,\u201d \u201cChange of Level,\u201d \u201cSignificant Objects,\u201d and \u201cFloorscape\u201d dutifully are followed. Even \u201cNostalgia,\u201d the final element advocated in the \u201cCasebook,\u201d is represented in the building\u2019s fragmentary reflection of adjacent historical buildings. And if, at Willis Faber, Foster evacuated architecture into the adjacent fields of interior and landscape design, he arrived at exactly the fields that had sparked the Townscape movement three decades earlier. The ideas that would harden into Townscape first were advanced in the Architectural Review in a 1944 editorial. \u201cExterior Furnishing or Sharawaggi: The Art of Making Urban Landscape\u201d is an unabashed manifesto for a new form of town planning that took its cues from the English picturesque movement as well as from broader tendencies the author saw as endemic to the English national character.18 Contrasting prevailing trends of the Garden City movement, modernist planning, and British neoclassicism, \u201cExterior Furnishing\u201d signaled a form of coherence in town planning based on dissonance and juxtaposition. Such coherence often was found inside fig. 7.5 Gordon Cullen (British, 1914 94). \u201cEye as Movie Camera.\u201d From Gordon Cullen, \u201cTownscape Casebook,\u201d Architectural Review 106 (1949): 366. usTon c England\u2019s homes but rarely was seen in its cities and towns: \u201cAn interior to be successful should be the result of growth, of attachments formed over years to things old and new. The fear of one\u2019s modern cupboard clashing with the Victorian atmosphere of a room, or one\u2019s Victorian chandelier looking out of place in an Aalto environment is wholly unjustified.\u201d19 Five years later, the exotic label \u201cSharawaggi\u201d was exchanged for the more pedestrian \u201cTownscape\u201d in a lengthy development of the earlier article signed by I. de Wolfe, nom de plume of Review editor Hugh de Cronin Hastings.20 Here, Hastings found a more recent analogy for dissonant coherence in English middle class decoration in the capricious combination of mismatched furniture, accessories, and chintz in everyday domestic interiors. Townscape marked a concerted attempt to transfer this potent visual sensibility to the urban landscape. To assist in the translation, Hastings\u2019s article was followed by Cullen\u2019s eleven page \u201cCasebook\u201d of principles to be adopted by the would be Townscape planner. Among the many critics of Townscape was the architect Basil Taylor, who in a 1954 BBC Radio talk attempted to draw sharp distinctions between modern architecture and these renovated picturesque principles.21 Nikolaus Pevsner\u2019s response to Taylor\u2014in which he remarked, \u201cThe modern revolution of the early twentieth century and the picturesque revolution of one hundred years before had all their fundamentals in common\u201d22 \u2014 sparked an intense partisan debate on the topic. \u201cHad Pevsner deliberately set out to infuriate the young,\u201d Banham opined, \u201che could hardly have done better.\u201d23 Alan Colquhoun issued a stern rebuke of Pevsner\u2019s position,24 and later, following Pevsner\u2019s \u201cEnglishness of English Art\u201d radio addresses on the BBC, a flurry of critical reactions appeared, including Colin Rowe\u2019s condemnation of \u201cthe insufferable tedium of Townscape.\u201d25 As outlined at the outset of the present book, many of the younger generation reacted against the Review by embracing a geometrically disciplined modern classicism introduced via Le Corbusier and Rudolf Wittkower.26 But as Banham pointed out, these attempts were undermined by a growing distance between the rigid geometries of classical form and advances in technology, mathematics, and other influences during the 1950s and \u201960s. In moving away from classical forms, many architects inadvertently moved their work directly toward the neopicturesque tendencies they proclaimed to resist. As Banham put it, \u201cSuch \u2018scientific\u2019 concepts as open endedness, the promulgation of growth and change as qualities to be incorporated in building designs, and the acceptance of expendability and impermanence, all combined to bring on a kind of architecture, and architectural philosophy, that must have looked reassuringly familiar to the editors of the Architectural Review.\u201d27 In his articulation of Uvedale Price\u2019s theory of the picturesque, De Wolfe [Hastings] outlined an \u201cEnglish Revolt\u201d against the \u201cGrand Manner\u201d of French classical planning. The \u201cradical\u201d English approach contrasted the \u201crational\u201d French method by advancing independence over equality, the particular over the universal, parts over wholes, the real over the ideal, and increasing complexity over increasing conformity.28 Banham prized exactly these values, not least among them radicalism, throughout his career. He and his colleagues at the Review also shared an unabashed commitment to functional accommodation, a pragmatic approach that addressed each problem on its own merits, a tendency to foreground architecture's visual aspects, and a soft spot for disciplinary outsiders. These associations point to a final paradox in Banham\u2019s late writings. On one hand, Banham left behind a near classical definition of architecture as achieved through closed, compressive, masonry works. On the other, he cleaved to the distinctly modern values of clarity, honesty, and unity. Canonical High Tech works such as Centre Pompidou rejected the former values but retained the latter, suggesting either the possibility of an architecture that eschewed traditional \u201cmaterials and methods\u201d while espousing modern values or the possibility that High Tech represented a mode of building that operated somewhere outside the disciplinary ken.29 The \u201cOpposite Case\u201d at Willis Faber went even further toward the possibility of building beyond architecture by eluding all six of Banham\u2019s categories and dissolving into an experiential milieu constructed primarily of interiors and landscape. Whether or not one chooses to label it architecture, Centre Pompidou rightfully inherited Banham\u2019s \u201cother\u201d tradition extending from Victorian engineering via Giedion through constructivism and clip on into canonical High Tech. Willis Faber and other examples of Banham\u2019s \u201cOpposite Case,\u201d however, suggested an altogether different historical lineage with claims to the parentage of High Tech\u2014another \u201cother\u201d that moves back via Pevsner through Townscape, the International Style, and nineteenth century eclecticism to the picturesque. In accommodating these contrasting affiliations, Banham\u2019s late writings on High Tech hold in paradoxical suspension dichotomies with which he had wrestled throughout his career: on one hand, an architecture of rigorous formal coherence and memorable visual images; on the other, an architecture of dissonant juxtaposition with a tendency to dissipate into adjacent fields of cultural production. In High Tech, Banham found both a progressive aesthetic suffused with \u201coperational lore\u201d and a responsible ethic charged with \u201capparent intelligence.\u201d He also found a method of working suitable for the construction of monumental symbols of contemporary culture and equipped to handle the quotidian challenges of \u201cnine to five\u201d practice. In High Tech buildings, he found compellingly articulated details to satisfy learned connoisseurs dispersed within immersive experiential milieus that accommodated distracted flaneurs; and, in its architects, he found a staunch commitment to architecture\u2019s most storied traditions coupled with a firm resolve, when necessary, to militate against unproductive habits and conventions. Tragically, Banham\u2019s life was cut short before he could marshal these dichotomies into the chapters of Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech. In this unfinished chronicle of both a visual style and an operative technique, Banham was poised not to resolve High Tech\u2019s paradoxes but rather to instrumentalize them to explain a mode of \u201cmaking architecture\u201d suffused, like his own writing, with clarity, honesty, and unity as well as with complexity, invention, diversity... and, of course, with wit, too!

His chapter on \u201cArchitecture\u201d in Bauen in Frankreich begins as follows: \u201cThe concept of architecture is linked to the material of stone. Heaviness and monumentality belong to the nature of the material, just as the clear division between supporting and supported parts does.\u201d Owing to the influence of new materials, he continued, \u201cIt seems doubtful whether the limited concept of\u2018architecture\u2019 will indeed endure.\u201d See Sigfried Giedion, Building in France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferro Concrete [1928] (Santa Monica, CA: Getty Center, 1995), 90. Importantly, Giedion intended the chapter title to include a question mark\u2014\u201cArchitektur?\u2019\u2014but the editors failed to include it in the book as published. For a discussion of the omission, see Sokratis Giorgiadis\u2019s critical introduction to the English edition, Giedion, Building in France, 49. This line of argumentation, of course, resonates deeply with the tendency among German architects of the 1920s and \u201930s to use the term Baukunst in lieu of Architektur. See, for example, Hans Hildebrand\u2019s translation of Le Corbusier\u2019s Vers une architecture as Kommende Baukunst (Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Ansalt, 1926). If the English title, Towards a New Architecture, exaggerated the French original\u2019s claims to novelty, the German one downplayed its endorsement of traditional disciplinarity.

High Tech was the only real novelty to emerge in the architecture of the 1980s, though some of the most characteristic buildings exemplifying this trend were designed, or even built, during the seventies. However, none were actually labelled \u201cHigh Tech\u201d until 1979, and the main currency of the term really dates from 1983, by which time it had become a common label for many things besides buildings, and was rapidly passing into general usage in journalism and conversation. Any stylistic label that gains such wide and rapid public acceptance as did \u201cHigh Tech\u201d in the 1980s is not likely to be well defined or precise. Popular usage, especially in journalism and advertising copy, applied the term to everything that was new and fashionable from proprietary medicines to running shoes and skiing equipment, to almost anything controlled by a microprocessor chip, and as a visual or stylistic label it seems to mean everything from round cornered (portable radios, or if made of white wire mesh, cosmetic trays) to horizontally ribbed (travel goods), from matte black (light fittings) to \u201cindustrial blue\u201d (also light fittings) to dead white (certain sports cars) or black and perforated (furniture) and almost anything at all that even faintly resembles a space vehicle or a toy robot from Japan. If we may make a preliminary but important distinction at this point, it is necessary to make a clear differentiation between \u201cHigh Tech,\u201d which seems to be most often used as a label for the visual aspects of the design of whatever object is so called, and such terms as \u201cAdvanced Engineering\u201d and \u201cState of the Art Technology,\u201d both of which refer to the actual level of technological innovation in a design. This text will avoid the phrase \u201cState of the Art Technology\u201d because of grave ambiguities in its everyday usage and will normally distinguish between High Tech and Advanced Engineering. To illustrate this distinction from outside the field of architecture, we may instance the Salomon downhill ski boot and the Moulton AM7 bicycle. The Salomon REYNER BANHAM ski boot, which has been called High Tech by some writers, appears not to contain many significantly \u201chigher\u201d technologies than have been available in other downhill boots, but its visual presentation has been very skillfully styled to emphasize whatever claims to technical superiority it may possess. The Moulton cycle, described as \u201cadvanced engineering\u201d by its manufacturer, on the other hand, derives its appearance almost entirely from the engineering techniques involved in its design and construction, which are indeed unique to this type of bicycle, rather than from any self conscious decision about what style to employ. And one may admit that neither of these two statements is necessarily one hundred percent absolutely true; the styling of the Salomon boot probably does derive in part from innovations in its materials and mode of fabrication, and the apparent absence of self conscious styling from the Moulton may itself derive from some barely formulated aesthetic preferences on the part of Alex Moulton, the patron of the company that makes them. As applied to architecture, which is our main (but not exclusive) business here, the term High Tech often seems to partake of the sense of Advanced Engineering as well as that of visual style and therefore can mean anything from \u201cslickly mechanistic presentation\u201d to \u201cat the cutting edge of environmental technology\u201d\u2014and it can mean either or both of them in any ratio of admixture and at any level from the purely factual to the strictly visual to the clearly mythological. In their book High Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for the Home, which was the first to use the phrase in its title, and popularized the term among general readers interested in design, the authors, Joan Kron and Suzanne Slesin, derive the phrase itself from \u201cHigh Style\u201d and seem to be unaware that, in architectural circles at least, the phrase \u201cHigh Technology\u201d had been in use since the very late 1960s. Furthermore, they seem to use and interpret the term as no more than the label for a particular fashion for using industrial (or industrial looking) products in home furnishing and interior decorating, though most of the designs and produits trouves which they illustrate are probably better described as merely \u201cFunctional\u201d since few are advanced in their engineering, and equally few exhibit self conscious styling beyond choice of paint colors. This basically Functionalist quality may be the reason they felt justified in invoking in their introduction the whole mythology of the Modern Movement in architecture\u2014 the opening words of their first chapter claim (with the utmost historical insouciance) that \u201cthe industrial aesthetic was born in 1851 when Sir Joseph Paxton, an engineer and gardener, designed and built the vast Crystal Palace.\u201d1 Whether or not this statement is accurate or historically useful, it represents a version of a proposition that every member of the Modern Movement in architecture has accepted as something like religious dogma since the beginning of the present century and was taught to all the architects of the High Tech generation while they were still at architecture school. This almost un thought phrase of Kron and Slesin should alert us to the kind of deep and diffuse underpinnings on which High Tech as an attitude and as a body of design practice claims to be founded. One cannot understand High Tech, nor the accusations of \u201cnostalgia\u201d that are often levelled at it, without understanding the nature of this mythology of \u201cLes Grands Constructeurs du XIX Siecle,\u201d founded on the works of Sigfried Giedion and Nikolaus Pevsner, and its permeation throughout the ideology of Modernist design in the present century. There are, however, other kinds of mythologies at work in the general understandings of High Tech, and of those who have taken a stand in opposition to it. Chief of these is the Mythology of Technical Ignorance. Thus the one thing that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d about the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the building designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, which serves as the High Tech \u201cmonument of definition\u201d for Kron and Slesin (and most other writers) is that it is supposed to \u201clook like an oil refinery!\u201d In fact, it looks like nothing of the sort, this mythology depends on a general ignorance of engineering among the \u201cculturati,\u201d and if Pompidou resembles any other class of building at all, it is a particular type of steam powered electrical generating station that is favored in California. Yet this strikingly clear resemblance to the California power stations has never entered into the general body of discourse about either the Centre or about High Tech in general. Such anecdotal mythologies of ignorance, based upon the technical unawareness of humanists, have encumbered critical and historical writing about Modern Architecture since its beginnings but have been made worse in recent years by that recrudescence of hostility to all forms of technology among Western intellectuals, which is discussed later in this chapter. A more suggestive and extremely instructive type of mythologizing appears in a very strange observation on aeronautical design by the Italian industrial designer and proponent of \u201cBio design,\u201d Luigi Colani: The Battle of Britain fought in 1940 revealed very interesting examples of biodesign as seen in aircraft. The two adversaries in this decisive air battle were the German Messerschmitt 109 and the British Spitfire. The former was a hi tech squarish looking plane, while the Spitfire looked more like a fish than a plane, with its oval shaped fluke like wings and soft aero design. Messerschmitt was a stubborn man and he ignored the advice of his aerodynamic expert Edgar Schmued who was better aware of what a high speed fighter should look like. Schmued quit Messerschmitt and went to America. There he designed for North American Aviation the P 51 Mustang\u2014a bio look Messerschmitt with softer lines and better aerodynamics. The fact that both the bio Spitfire and the bio derivative of the Messerschmitt, the P 51 Mustang, were both superior to the hard headed, hi tech design of the German plane makes a very funny biodesign inside story. For one could say that bio design won the Battle of Britain!2 Whatever else may be wrong with this passage, in terms of military history or aeronautics, its main offense must surely be that it goes against common sense \u2014 if the Spitfires were so superior as a fighting machine, then surely it must have been more \"High Tech\u201d than the Bfi09, rather than the other way about. Clearly, Colani is not talking about technology but is exercising a private system of aesthetics or iconography\u2014except that the system is not so private; much conversation and critical writing on these topics uses the term \u201cHigh Tech\u201d to mean something like what Colani appears to mean here: \u201cresembling the appearance of machines as they were understood in the classic literature of Modernism of the Twenties and Thirties.\u201d Most alert and currently well informed readers, confronted with these remarks of Colani\u2019s, would know exactly what he intended, even if they knew that the words would be nonsense in any other context. Almost all discourse employing the term \u201cHigh Tech\u201d tends to vacillate between a purely stylistic reading at one extreme and a genuine appreciation of technological matters at the other, and any study of the topic which intends to do justice to it must recognize and incorporate this variability, even at the risk of some confusion. And since this study will be discussing architecture, not simply engineering, the symbolic elements and other traditional aspects of architecture as a civic art\u2014\u201cstyle,\u201d that is \u2014 are an essential part of the cultural pretensions and rewards of the High Tech adventure. Again, the rise of High Tech must be seen in the context of a number of hostile counter mythologies, quite apart from the accusations of technical nostalgia, and/or ineradicable suspicions about the actual technical qualities of the buildings themselves. Of these counter mythologies, the most significant was, obviously, the general hostility to Technology that has already been mentioned. The period of the rise of High Tech is conveniently bracketed by two books that expressed the pro foundest misgivings about Technology as a force in design and in the world at large. The first was La Speranza Progettuale (Design, Nature, and Revolution) by Tomas Maldonado, which had first appeared in 1970. Since Maldonado had been head of the immensely influential Hochschule fur Gestaltung at Ulm in Germany, where he had seemed bent on revivifying Functionalism by injections of Information Theory, Cybernetics, and Systems Analysis, his apparent defection from Technological Modernism was the more provocative and, as will be observed below in the case of Porsche Design, the more paradoxical. This was, however, something of an \u201cinside\u201d affair, a designer turning against technological enthusiasms in design; the second book was more general and encyclopedic in its scope and, published in 1977, appeared in the year that Centre Pompidou was opened. This was Autonomous Technology by the MIT sociologist Langdon Winner; not a work of noisy polemic like so many of the Anti Tech tracts of the earlier 1970s, it was more of a grand survey of all the doubts about technology\u2019s place in society that had been expressed by major thinkers like H.G. Wells, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Paul Goodman, Herbert Marcuse, and Henri Lefeb vre down to Alvin Toffler. Nevertheless, Winner\u2019s introduction does include a prime quotation of early 1960s Techno paranoia, from Mario Savio\u2019s famous speech at the very beginning of the student disturbances at Berkeley: \u201cThere is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at the heart that you can\u2019t take part; you can\u2019t even passively take part, and you\u2019ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you\u2019ve got to make it stop.\u201d3 Though it will be clear that Savio\u2019s \u201cMachine\u201d is a metaphor for a whole social and political system, the very use of such a metaphor of hostility is a fair indication of the kind of disrepute that Technology\u2014understood or misunderstood \u2014 was about to enter in academic circles. Autonomous Technology, for all its carefully academic tone of voice, presents an intellectual prospect so bleak that it remains almost incredible that, in the year of its publication, there should also be a celebration of the apparent pleasures of technology as exuberant as Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers\u2019s colorful culture machine on the Plateau Beaubourg. The subsequent rise and consolidation of the High Tech \u201cmovement\u201d thus took place in a doubly hostile intellectual environment, caught between extreme pessimism about Autonomous Technology on the one hand, and the return of Revivalist architecture, in the guise of Post Modernism, on the other. It is clear, therefore, that High Tech must have been securely rooted in a powerful sense of self confidence (or moral self justification) among its architects and a knowing (or indifferent) resistance to current intellectual fashions among the clients who commissioned [it.] The architectural and historical critical complexities that must be faced in considering High Tech architecture are therefore profound but rewarding, wide ranging but ultimately even more instructive about the nature of architecture than about technology. For let it be emphasized here, as it will be throughout this study, High Tech has far more to do with architecture than it does with Technology, even though it would be inconceivable without the availability of certain materials and techniques and the example and vital contributions of certain engineers. The kind of architectural and technological issues that are at stake will be demonstrated here in a \u201cfirst approximation\u201d argument by comparing two buildings that both answer to most of the commonly held views of High Tech architecture. Between them they display most of the characteristics of the \u201cstyle\u201d however it be defined; both are in England, barely thirty miles apart, and designed by British architectural offices, but they serve two continental European automobile manufacturers with strong claims to be at the cutting edge of automotive technology because of their successes in competition: Porsche and Renault. They also serve substantially similar functions involving customer relations and the storage and distribution of spare parts. In architectural terms they could hardly be more different, however, yet both have been confidently identified as \u201cHigh Tech,\u201d albeit with qualifications. The Porsche building of 1986, designed by the Dewhurst Haslam Partnership, probably comes closer to the general public\u2019s idea of what High Tech should be like, and this is not surprising since the architects clearly gave attention to the creation of imagery sympathetic to the company\u2019s products: \u201cHaving decided that one elevational treatment must convey the company\u2019s image, the architects felt that it should somehow relate to the company\u2019s product, perhaps the most highly engineered production car on the road,\u201d wrote Stephen Trombley,4 in his extended account of the building\u2019s design \u2014but without observing that \u201cthe company\u2019s product,\u201d in the eyes of many of the public, would tend to include not only cars but also the various items of non automotive luxury consumer merchandise, such as watches and sunglasses, that are marketed under the brand Porsche Design and enjoy a prestige that derives in part from the competition successes of the cars and in part from their styling, which corresponds well to what style conscious members of the public in the 1980s supposed High Tech to be. And it is not only the non architectural public who read Porsche Design as \u201cHigh Tech\u201d\u2014the first example of der High tech Asthetik cited in a polemical article of 1986 by the German architectural historian Volcker Fisher, \u201cTechnologie als Fetisch: High tech in Architektur und Design,\u201d is Porsche Design\u2019s celebrated Feuerzeug (cigarette lighter) of 1984,5 a typically and conventionally reticent/elegant product that acquires \u201cesteem by association\u201d by having the Porsche name on it, regardless of functional merit or technical qualities (which in this case are both high, as is the price!). Among well informed, affluent, fashion conscious consumers, Porsche was thus a name with distinct stylistic, as well as technical, connotations. Dewhurst Haslam thus had the conspicuous advantage, not often enjoyed by even High Tech architects, of working with a corporate imagery that was understood by a wide public, but it was also directly applicable to buildings, since it employed an imagery born of the same modernist tradition as their architecture. Ferdinand Alexander Porsche III, chief of the car company and later of Porsche Design, had received a crucial part of his design training at the Hochschule fur Gestaltung at Ulm, one of the focal institutions of technical/aesthetic Modernism in the 1950s when its dominant teacher was Tomas Maldonado. The Porsche 911, which he designed shortly after leaving the HfG, may well be the first example of \u201cHigh Tech\u201d in the sense which is being discussed here, because it has also been (together with the products of Mercedes Benz and BMW) one of the sacred objects of the mythology of German technological mastery, the legend of Vorsprung durch Technik. This anchorage in the older traditions of Modernism is underlined by the architects\u2019 own definition of the Porsche building\u2019s style as being \u201chigh tech... but high tech classic. Not high tech innovatory.\u201d6 The outcome of this attitude, as it is seen by drivers approaching the Porsche building from the motorway, is a long, twenty two bay two story facade of brushed aluminum cladding panels of \u201chard, grey metallic appearance\u201d and dark glass strip windows. Each letter of the Porsche company\u2019s famous logo occupies almost the full width of one 4.5 meter panel on the upper facade, and the elevation finishes as a flat, straight, and uninterrupted cornice line. The roof, in fact, is not absolutely flat but is interrupted by the thirty six glazed pyramids that cover the internal atrium, but none of this can be perceived from ground level at normal viewing distances. The architectural image is an uninflected square box; a classic \u2014not to say conventional \u2014Modernist package, neat and smooth and as reticently elegant as the non automotive products of Porsche Design. This tightly packaged image not only conceals the facts about the roof layout, but it also fails to acknowledge the functional differentiations of the interior of the building. As the Porsche company\u2019s operational base in Britain, it has to provide reception areas for customer relations, administrative offices, a large service bay where newly delivered cars are made ready for delivery, and an even larger area for receiving, storing, and dispatching spare parts (engine testing and other \u201cdirty\u201d functions are in a separate structure). Only some changes in the fenestration of the upper story of the facade give any clue that there might be internal functional differences, and these cannot be made to yield any specific information about which function is where. The style of the exterior is marked by precisely that \u201canonymity\u201d that has always been one of the more mythological characteristics of Modern Architecture \u2014but also one of the prized qualities of the \u201cBlack Box\u201d approach to the case work for high technology equipment (though one should observe that the most admired boxes, from Max Braun to Saxpy computers, have been grey or beige). One should also pause to observe that there is no necessary connection between architecture that is in any of the styles that have been termed \u201cHigh Tech\u201d and the presence of \u201chigh technology\u201d or even advanced engineering in the building, either as a function to be housed or as an aid to the better structural or environmental performance of the building shell. Of all the buildings known to the author, the one which contains the very highest technology, the most advanced engineering must be the Stanford Linear Accelerator Facility in California. The contents of the building are, chiefly, a two mile long evacuated steel tube in which super conducted electromagnets produce 20 billion electron volts of energy to accelerate a beam of sub atomic particles to almost the speed of light. The building that houses this wonder machine is a simple and almost character less corrugated metal shed that extends over two miles of territory but is otherwise totally unremarkable in any sense relevant to architecture as an art. Contrariwise, some of the most visually elaborate and highly finished works of High Tech architecture have, in fact, no more than rhetorical or mythological connection with any advanced technology or engineering. At Porsche, however, there seems to be a good correlation between the claims to quality and performance implicit in the style of architecture and the actual quality and performance of the building. Not only do the external cladding systems, for instance, give the total building envelope excellent thermal characteristics, balancing heat gains and losses so that heating is needed for only the coldest eight weeks of the year, but this is also, in the current phrase, a \u201cSmart Building\u201d\u2014it uses its own computer and installed circuitry not only for the customary business purposes but also to monitor and control its environmental installations as a self regulating system. The concept of the Smart Building is only one of the ramifications of the impact of the use of computers or buildings in architecture. Computerization already affects all aspects of design from the initial feasibility studies and cost analysis to the final production drawings, the management of the construction site, and the building itself when completed. It is one of the ironies of the High Tech period that the ready availability of computerization, one of the higher technologies now within the reach of all but the most modest architectural offices, has had almost no effect on the style or appearance of buildings, nor is there any reason why it should \u2014 so that any purported references to computer technologies in the appearance of buildings are therefore purely symbolic. Smart systems aside, however, Porsche may indeed be judged \"Classic\u201d and \u201cNot innovatory\u201d as its architects claimed. Its view of architecture and design, both inside and outside, holds closely to the three distinguishing principles of Modern architecture of the International Style in the version set out by Alfred H. Barr as long ago as 1932: \u201cThe distinguishing aesthetic principles of the International Style...are three: emphasis upon volume\u2014space enclosed by thin planes or surfaces as opposed to the suggestion of mass or solidity; regularity as opposed to symmetry or other kinds of obvious balance; and, lastly, dependence upon the intrinsic elegance of materials, technical perfection, and fine proportions as opposed to applied ornament.\u201d7 Although the brushed metal surfaces around the central atrium inside the Porsche building, the lavish planting, the fountains, and the programmed lighting that complements the play of water may represent a very extreme \u201cLate Modern\u201d version of the International Style, everything is still reassuringly familiar to the visitor. If the design of the Porsche building had been described as \u201cOff the shelf components and off the shelf thinking,\u201d this in no way derogates the quality of its construction, the immense competence of its resolutely conventional design, its functional serviceability, or the satisfaction that it clearly affords to the company and the customers \u2014 both owners and agents\u2014who come to use it... But if it is compared to the 1983 Renault building at Swindon, which serves almost exactly the same purposes, it can only appear less inspired, however stylish, and (apparently) less innovatory. Against Porsche\u2019s sleek exterior \u201cwithout rhetoric\u201d (to revive Peter Smithson\u2019s phrase to characterize the grau im grau boxwork of Braun radio, another manifestation of the HfG at Ulm), Renault flourishes its expressed and articulated structural system on the exterior, outside the enclosed envelope that forms its functional volume. This system is a tracery of tensile rods stabilizing a regular grid of yellow upright columns joined by braced bridging girders that support the roofing membrane, all in striking contrast with both the greenfield site on which it sits in splendid isolation and the matte grey metallic panels of the enclosing walls, set back a full meter behind the external skeleton and across which the structure casts elegant shadows even in the misty British sunlight. In striking contrast to Porsche, again, the roof line is not flat, but acknowledges the fact that each 25 meter square bay of the structure is roofed by a kind of stiff tent formed by the bridging girders and suspended by more tensile rods from the tops of the upright columns that form its corners like tent poles. Nor is the plan a neat rectangle, as at Porsche. Although the main spare parts store is indeed a rectangle, four bays by nine bays, there are six other bays added at the \u201cpublic\u201d end of the building that destroy any visual sense of that rectangle\u2014the most visible of them, indeed, being an open sided canopy over a parking space for visitors. This not only destroys any sense of the enclosing walls as a substantial part of the building but puts the emphasis instead on the skeletal system of uprights and tension rods and bridging girders that support the roof tents, and thus serves to explain, as it were, the whole generating system of the design. Similar as its functions may be to those of Porsche, physically and commercially, there are clearly a range of other considerations that serve to set the two operations apart conceptually, and \u2014aside from differences of architectural temperament\u2014 the most important of these is concerned with company imagery. Success in competition, and the kind of engineering resourcefulness that is needed to win races and rallies have played a large part in the public relations of the Regie Renault, but since these matters were manifested in specialized competition vehicles remote from the Renault models the public can actually buy (whereas all Porsches are sports cars), they are not integrated into the public\u2019s view of the company\u2019s everyday products. Nor is there a parallel high style product brand like Porsche Design to reinforce an imagery of high performance and high technology. Foster Associates therefore had neither the help nor the limitations of an architecturally relevant company image when they came to design the building, and the only connection one may perceive is that the yellow color of the exposed structure is more or less the same as the livery that was used on Renault\u2019s Formula One Racing cars \u2014 but, then, such a yellow is also notoriously one of the favorite colors of Norman Foster, whose office designed the building, for his own personal vehicles, from bicycles to helicopters. Furthermore, yellow is also one of the preferred colors of High Tech as a \u201cmovement.\u201d It \u2014 and a variety of related greens, as well as reds and blues \u2014 appears frequently in the work of Rogers and other practitioners of the style, and it thus makes it easier to see Foster\u2019s work of this kind as part of a coherent and deliberated tendency in recent architecture. Indeed, it was the publication of Renault that provided the occasion for the Architectural Review to produce, in July 1983, what appears to be the first special issue of any professional magazine to be devoted specifically to High Tech as an architectural movement in being, rather than a putative tendency, and to an attempted assessment of the movement\u2019s background and value systems. The use of such bright, usually primary colors \u2014in opposition to the \u201ccanonical white\u201d (and occasional earth tones) of the International Style\u2014together with a conspicuous exhibition of structure, might speculatively be taken as two of a set of three \u201cdistinguishing principles\u201d of High Tech architecture as a style, to match Barr\u2019s three principles of the International Style. In that case, the third principle would probably be something like \u201cexposure of mechanical and environmental services,\u201d as exemplified by the exterior of Centre Pompidou and the interiors of works such as the University Medical Center at Calgary, Alberta, by Eb Zeidler and Associates. Yet, if this were a test of orthodoxy, so to speak, it is one that Foster\u2019s work would normally fail. Since the Renault building was not deemed to need heavy servicing, there was not originally much ductwork or trunking that could be exposed. Certainly it can be seen if one knows where to look, but not to the same explicit and dramatic effect as in the work of Rogers, for instance. Indeed, it is the spectacular servicing of Centre Pompidou, together with its exhibitionistic structure and its brilliant coloring (though the yellow is missing for once!) that make it the monument of reference by which High Tech Architecture is usually defined. Structure, Services, and Color\u2014these may well be called the three distinguishing stylistic principles of High Tech, but only in opposition to Barr\u2019s three principles of the International Style. For between High Tech and the International Style, there is one of the most notable and instructive oppositions (or, at least, distinctions) that has appeared in the history of Modern architecture as a fine art, and it is a distinction that throws an interesting light on the way that Modernism in architecture has construed (or misconstrued) its own history. The main issue can be summarized thus: the major historical accounts of the sources of Modern architecture in the immediately pre Modern phase, most notably Pevsner\u2019s Pioneers of Modem Design and Giedion\u2019s Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton, tend to present views of the architecture of the nineteenth century which did not connect, visually, with the kind of twentieth century architecture that these historian apologists supported and claimed to be descended from them. Briefly, the buildings of the Grands Constructeurs, like Paxton and Eiffel, who were so admired by historians of that generation, tended to be open work, transparent, with clearly expressed structural skeletons, whereas the International Style work of Giedion\u2019s friends Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, or Pevsner\u2019s hero, Gropius, tended to consist of closed volumes whose structural skeletons were not easily perceived nor\u2014indeed \u2014part of the visual design of the building. Thus, in order to provide a respectable nineteenth century parentage for Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Weis senhof apartment block of 1927 by comparing it to the pioneering metal framed structure of the famous Chocolat Menier factory, for instance, Giedion has to illustrate the Mies building in the unfinished condition, with its steel frame still visible,8 which clearly was not how Mies intended his building to be seen. Nevertheless, there has for a long time been another tradition within architectural Modernism, often visionary and unbuilt, which \u2014 unlike the International Style \u2014 has seemed more directly affiliated to the work of Les Grands Constructeurs: Constructivism and its derivatives. This was the kind of architecture which was celebrated in the Frankfurt Museum\u2019s exhibition Vision der Moderne in 1986, and seems to have been regarded by many (including the exhibition\u2019s organizers) as a kind of \u201crevenge of the other modern architecture.\u201d It might be better to regard the works of this tradition simply as the realization of some unused possibilities of the Modern tradition, but however the case is interpreted, it is clear that\u2014a few works like the Porsche building aside \u2014nearly all of what passes as High Tech in architecture belongs in that part of the Modern Movement, and not that which later became the orthodox International Style. What then of Porsche, which clearly does not belong on that Constructivist side, yet is widely (and convincingly) regarded as being of the High Tech persuasion? It is clear that High Tech is not simply a subdivision of \u201cConstructivist Architecture\u201d as the Frankfurt team have tended to maintain but has other roots and allegiances. It will be argued in this book that what constitutes the crucial novelty and difference between High Tech and the more generalized \u201cConstructive\u201d tradition is that High Tech takes a more than constructive view of architecture; [High Tech] does not see buildings simply as passive shelters against the elements, but rather as complete and active environmental systems, dispensing energy and information to maintain a well regulated ambiance for the building\u2019s functions. The appearance of a High Tech building normally offers the explicit promise, and hopefully the physical delivery, of superior environmental performance. Hence, therefore, the important part played by exposed service ducting and visible environmental machinery \u2014 conspicuously absent from Constructivist projects \u2014in High Tech as a style. But even without such three dimensional symbolism, the high finish and the understood technological product affiliations of Porsche do at least offer an allegory of superior performance\u2014which, fortunately, is made real by the observable facts of the building\u2019s interior environment. In general, then, the argument of this book will be that High Tech, however variable its visual manifestations may be, along the scale from Porsche to Centre Pompidou, contains an implicit or explicit promise of higher performance than was the case in earlier architectures. This elevated performance might be structural, environmental, functional, but preferably all three, and it is understood to be obtained by recourse to the most advanced engineering technologies\u2014\u201ccutting edge\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cstate of the art\u201d\u2014available in all the relevant fields. And it is also, let us remind ourselves, still architecture, \u201cthe mother of the arts,\u201d with all that is implied in that traditional claim. Lay observers, however elevated their social rank, may perhaps be excused for superficially supposing otherwise, and the fact that they do suppose otherwise is, in a sense, a striking tribute to the symbolic power of the architectural forms they have employed. \u201cWell, Mr. Rogers,\u201d said the Prince of Wales at the opening of the Inmos factory in South Wales, \u201cit looks as though the engineers got their own way this time!\u201d9 The engineer in question, Tony Hunt, is universally accepted as having made crucial contributions to the structure, but closer study will show that architecture is still at work, still in ultimate control of design, most notably in the disposition of the ventilating ductwork, which is disposed as the architects wanted it, not as the servicing consultants had proposed. High Tech, it seems, is another step in the long struggle to bring innovative engineering techniques within the traditional disciplines of architecture, or to stretch those disciplines until the technologies can be accommodated within them. If I had to produce a first approximation definition of High Tech, one that would embrace the whole range from Porsche to Pompidou, I would be tempted to say that it was the most recent way of bringing advanced engineering within the discipline of architecture, comparable with the achievements of Peter Behrens and Auguste Perret in the first fifteen years of the present century. At the end of my first extended study of the history of Modern Architecture, I wrote: It may well be that what we have hitherto understood as architecture, and what we are beginning to understand of technology are incompatible disciplines. The architect who proposes to run with technology knows now that he will be in fast company, and that, in order to keep up, he may have to emulate the Futurists and discard his whole cultural load including the professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect. If, on the other hand, he decides not to do this, he may find that a technological culture has decided to go on without him.10 These words caused some offense at the time, but the subsequent twenty five years of architecture seem to have revealed a grain of truth in them; this challenge is, it now appears, one of the fundamentals of Modernist architecture. What I did not appreciate at the time, however, was how far some architects were prepared to go, in defiance of a rising tide of historical revivalism, in order to keep up with advanced engineering, but without divesting themselves of those \u201cprofessional garments.\u201d The achievement of architects of that particular persuasion is High Tech, an alternative Modernism that has arisen from what might be termed the \u201cdisgrace\u201d of the older Modernism of the International Style. What follows is an attempt to define, chronicle, and understand this alternative Modernism, which surprised the world of architecture by becoming successful against the grain of expectations in the ostensibly Post Modernist culture of the 1970s and \u201980s.

As one who observed the Battle of Britain from within the aircraft industry itself, I find Colani\u2019s reading of the subject very dubious. In terms of straight line speed and maneuverability, the Bfi09\u2019s used in the Battle of Britain were regarded as superior to the Spitfires of that epoch, and in any case, more than half the British combat missions were flown by other aircraft, such as Hawker Hurricanes and Boulton Paul Defiants. The margins of victory seem not to have been aerodynamics, but the heavier armament of the British machines and hesitation by the Luftwaffe in exploiting the numerical advantage they had acquired over the RAF in the first weeks of the battle.

        "On 15 December 1987, the British architectural historian and critic Reyner Banham wrote to the publisher Axel Menges to provide an update on his latest book project.",
        "Two years earlier, Menges had suggested that Banham \u201cwrite a book...that integrates today's High tech architecture (Foster, Rogers, Piano, Mangiarotti, etc.) into a tradtion [sic] of almost 200 years of technologically oriented architecture.\u201d1 With Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech, Banham planned to answer Menges\u2019s request with a detailed account of the movement\u2019s defining characteristics, historical sources, main practitioners, and implications for late twentieth century architectural culture.",
        "He included with his letter a summary of his argument, a draft outline of the book\u2019s contents, and an \u201cextensively re written introductory chapter,\u201d which, he claimed, \u201crepresented] his current thinking on the subject.\u201d2 At the time, Banham was in the process of relocating from his home in Santa Cruz, California, to New York City, where he had been named the Sheldon H.",
        "Solow Professor of the History of Architecture at New York University\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts.",
        "The book, he explained, would have to be put on hold until he and his wife, Mary, had completed their move, and he was able \u201cto get [himself] into a High Tech writing frame of mind.\u201d3 Unfortunately, the following weeks did not go as planned.",
        "The cancer for which Banham had undergone surgery the previous summer had returned, and he relocated not to New York but rather to London, where he succumbed to the disease on 19 March 1988.",
        "Banham\u2019s death at the age of sixty six silenced one of architecture\u2019s most distinctive voices, and his unfinished project on High Tech points to lacunae in the history of late twentieth century architecture that have persisted into the present.",
        "Though several publications have been devoted to the work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and other architects associated with High Tech, only a few general treatments of the movement exist, and the topic remains largely Piano + Rogers (Renzo Piano, Italian, b.",
        "1937; Richard Rogers, British, b.",
        "Italy, 1933).",
        "Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris, 1977) General view (detail).",
        "Photo by Michel Denance.",
        "See p.",
        "222, pi.",
        "unexplored by twenty first century scholars.4 Similarly, Banham\u2019s late career work on High Tech has been little discussed in the growing literature on his influential writing and thinking.",
        "In the present book, I address these lacunae with a detailed examination of writings by Banham from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period that coincides with the prehistory and maturation of High Tech architecture.",
        "Chapters focus on key moments in Banham\u2019s early engagement with the New Brutalism of Alison and Peter Smithson; his measured enthusiasm for various \u201cclip on\u201d approaches pursued by the Archigram group, Cedric Price, and others; his advocacy of \u201cwell tempered environments\u201d fostered by integrated mechanical and electrical systems; and his late career assessments of Foster, Piano, Rogers, and other High Tech practitioners.",
        "I complement these textual analyses with close readings of salient architectural projects of the period, not to provide a comprehensive historical treatment of High Tech but rather to bring into sharper relief the relationship between Banham\u2019s argumentation and specific qualities of the buildings and projects he chose to examine and, in a few important cases, to avoid.",
        "In contrast to other studies that focus on Banham\u2019s early writings and many extradisciplinary interests, I devote significant attention to Banham\u2019s late writings on High Tech, including archival materials held at the Getty Research Institute related to his unfinished manuscript.",
        "Banham\u2019s previously unpublished draft introduction to Making Architecture, \u201cHigh Tech and Advanced Engineering,\u201d has been included.",
        "As Banham planned to demonstrate, High Tech was plagued by ambiguities.",
        "On one hand, it was seen as a visual style based on easily graspable tropes such as exposed structure and mechanical services.",
        "On the other, it was understood as an attitude toward building particularly attentive to social relations and functional performance.",
        "Critics of the period seized on these apparent antinomies to charge the movement \u2014 and often along with it modern architecture more generally\u2014 with crimes ranging from contextual insensitivity to capitulation to capitalism.",
        "Banham, by contrast, saw in High Tech a reinvigoration of the visual qualities and guiding principles upon which modern architecture had been founded.",
        "For him, High Tech represented the continuation of an \u201cother modern architecture,\u201d one that developed alongside the canonical International Style of the 1920s and \u201930s and traced its genealogy through lesser known constructivist sources to \u201cles grands constructeurs\u201d of nineteenth century engineering.5 This \u201calternative Modernism,\u201d Banham claimed, could counter not only what he viewed as the cliched tropes of the International Style but also the anachronisms of the then ascendant idiom of postmodern architecture.6 As is well known, Banham often railed against entrenched conventions and dominant traditions in twentieth century architecture, and several commentators have addressed the distinctly antiestablishment current that runs through his writings.",
        "In a 1999 treatment, Panayotis Tournikiotis concentrated almost exclusively on Banham\u2019s first book, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i960), in which, he argued, Banham \u201cexposes the real modern movement in order to be able to reject it.\u201d7 Anthony Vidler, in an excellent assessment, linked Banham closely to his mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner, and demonstrated important links between Banham\u2019s modernism and Pevsner\u2019s advocacy of the picturesque tradition.",
        "Vidler\u2019s Banham articulated a \u201cFuturist Modernism,\u201d with a \u201ccall for a posttechnological, postacademic, even postarchitectural discourse\u201d in his writings of the 1950s and \u201960s,8 a call Banham answered with Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971), Scenes in America Deserta (1982), and other texts.",
        "Nigel Whiteley, in a comprehensive critical biography, ultimately conjured a pragmatist Banham.",
        "\u201cPragmatism and its associated values,\u201d he concluded, \u201cunderlay Banham\u2019s architectural thinking and freed his mind from the sort of dogma that had infiltrated much modernist thinking.\u201d9 Though I at times take issue with points made by my predecessors, I do not aim in the present book to contradict earlier interpretations.",
        "The Banham I present here exists alongside Tournikiotis\u2019s antiestablishment Banham, Vidler\u2019s futurist Banham, and Whiteley\u2019s pragmatist Banham.",
        "But where earlier narratives focus on Banham\u2019s well known impatience with disciplinary conventions, I draw attention to his simultaneous and seemingly contradictory embrace of the traditional values inscribed in those very conventions.",
        "This somewhat paradoxical Banham was as prone to quip that \u201carchitects who genuinely see how narrow and restricting are the traditions of their profession normally get out of it,\u201d as he was, just a few lines later, to endorse \u201ca world in which \u2018architect\u2019 is a meaningful and productive category of human being.\u201d10 This Banham is possible not because he famously \u201cchanged his mind\u201d over the course of his career,11 but rather because he tended to structure his arguments around persistent antinomies \u2014 tradition versus technology, aesthetics versus ethics, style versus performance \u2014 that he saw as key features of modern architecture and central to his discussion of High Tech.12 Drawing attention to these dialectics, particularly as they played out in Banham\u2019s late writings, brings to light important aspects of his thinking that to date have gone unexamined.",
        "Few have noticed, for example, that the \u201cother modern architecture\u201d Banham outlined in later texts was not identical with his earlier idea of une architecture autref3 or that his late career formulation of \u201cmaking architecture,\u201d which involved \u201cclarity and frugality in resolving functional problems within the canons of architecture,\u201d does not square easily with the antiestablishment agenda for which he is so often celebrated.14 Revisiting earlier writings with the concept of \u201cmaking architecture\u201d in mind not only clarifies Banham\u2019s various postulations of otherness in architecture but also reveals an other Banham, one committed not only to discrediting entrenched conventions and dissolving disciplinary boundaries but also to maintaining and strengthening core traditions and values.",
        "This more \u201cpractice oriented\u201d Banham provides a unique lens through which to reexamine High Tech architecture.15 Banham\u2019s early writings on the modem movement and the New Brutalism, his midcareer advocacy of the Archigram group and various \u201cclip on\u201d approaches, and his elevation of environmental technologies in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment (1969) deal directly with the movement\u2019s primary antecedents, while his late writings on the work of Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Richard Rogers remain some of the most valuable treatments of High Tech and its main exponents.",
        "A reevaluation of Banham\u2019s engagement with High Tech not only unsettles prevailing opinions regarding one of the twentieth century\u2019s most influential architectural historians, but also sheds new light on an important movement in architecture that has received scant critical analysis Before proceeding, some ground clearing of key terms is in order.",
        "Following Ban ham, I oscillate between using the term High Tech as a label specific to certain works of architecture dating primarily to the 1970s and \u201980s and as a more general description of any object that promises (whether or not it delivers) technological innovation or enhanced performance.16 Though the literature is not always consistent in this regard, as far as possible, capitalization signals the former sense of the term.",
        "Such consistency is more difficult to maintain with other important terms including modern, modernist, modernism, the modern movement, and the International Style.",
        "Banham often used these terms interchangeably, as in the second edition of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, which begins, \u201cThe \u2018Modern Movement\u2019 or \u2018The International Style\u2019 has had a long and productive life in architecture\u201d;17 at the outset of A Concrete Atlantis: U.S.",
        "Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture (1986), where he discussed \u201cthe classic modernist architecture of the International Style in Europe\u201d;18 and in the introduction to Making Architecture, where he referred to \u201cthe older Modernism of the International Style.\u201d19 Given such usage, a full disambiguation of his terminology is not possible.",
        "Nonetheless, it is important to approach the chapters that follow with an understanding of Banham\u2019s signal concern with questions of style, particularly the International Style, which he claimed in 1980 to be \u201cthe dominant style of our present century,\u201d20 and which he later noted had been his \u201cprime subject of study\u201d as a historian.21 Alfred J.",
        "Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is usually credited with coining the term somewhere around 1930,22 and it acquired its canonical air as the title of Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson\u2019s famous 1932 book of the same name23 The modern movement, on the other hand, is closely associated with Pioneers of the Modern Movement, the classic 1936 study written by Banham\u2019s dissertation adviser and mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner.24 In the present book, both International Style and modern movement usually refer to the ambiguous cluster of visual characteristics and sociopolitical values associated with the architecture of Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and related figures dating primarily to the 1920s and \u201930s and occasionally stretching back into the late nineteenth century and forward into the postwar period.25 As Banham used them, these terms typically retain a close association with Barr, Hitchcock, Johnson, Pevsner, and, for reasons that become clear below, Sigfried Giedion, and they often imply the shortcomings he found in those authors\u2019 formulations.",
        "Modern architecture is best understood in this context as a broader term that encompasses the canonical work of the 1920s and \u201930s, as well as later developments, including the New Brutalism, clip on architecture, and High Tech.",
        "This broadness greatly blunts the term\u2019s precision, as Banham acknowledged in his 1962 Guide to Modern Architecture.",
        "Given that modern architecture appeared to have \u201cgrown up\u201d by midcentury, he explained, the term could no longer stand exclusively for the \u201cbang up to date, born yesterday, as of now attributes\u201d that characterized the major achievements of the interwar years.26 It would be better, he surmised, to take it simply to mean \u201cnot old\u201d27 and to see the white walled, flat roofed, patent glazed consistency of the International Style as representing the \u201cteenage uniform of modern architecture.\u201d28 Extending Banham\u2019s metaphor, one might usefully understand the New Brutalist, clip on, and High Tech works discussed in this book as attempts to devise appropriate garments for a more mature phase of modern architecture in the latter half of the twentieth century.",
        "It is also important to note Banham\u2019s tendency to see modern architecture not simply as a style within the even broader category of \u201carchitecture\u201d but rather as constituting the whole of the field.",
        "\u201cIf it isn\u2019t modern nowadays,\u201d he wrote in 1962, \u201cit isn\u2019t architecture anymore, but archaeology, cowardice, or fancy dress.\u201d29 Banham\u2019s tendency to draw disciplinary boundaries by a process of exclusion figures strongly in my narrative, particularly in his late career treatment of High Tech and what he saw as its main stylistic adversary, postmodern architecture.30 Of course, modern and its many variants carry implications well beyond issues of style.",
        "The modern movement, for example, baldly implies action and, as Pevsner used it, signifies not only a stylistic category but also a cultural impetus, the collective ambition of a group of people who had placed the machine in a privileged position within society and artistic production.31 Banham certainly subscribed to this central place for mechanical technology in any conception of a modern movement, and maintained it in his own formulation of various \u201cmachine ages\u201d throughout his career.",
        "Related and somewhat loftier terms such as modernity and modernism, while occasionally used by Banham in reference to style, more often imply a cultural condition associated with self conscious innovation and distinct \u2014 if not always total \u2014ruptures between the often anxious inhabitants of a turbulent present and the established traditions and conventions of the past.32 This extended explication of terminojogy has been made necessary by Banham\u2019s persistent use of finely tuned, often dialectically structured terminological distinctions throughout his writing.",
        "Consider, for example, his 1955 gloss on the two main types of \u201cisms\u201d associated with the modern movement: \u201cOne, like Cubism, is a label, a recognition tag, applied by critics and historians to a body of work which appears to have certain consistent principles running through it, whatever the relationship of the artists; the other, like Futurism, is a banner, a slogan, a policy consciously adopted by a group of artists, whatever the apparent similarity or dissimilarity of their products.\u201d33 With this succinct partitioning of the modern movement\u2019s formal and ideological inflections, Banham set up his famous characterization of the New Brutalism as a contest between aesthetics and ethics.34 A similar structure is apparent in his 1960 \u201cstocktaking\u201d of contemporary architecture, in which he opposed the \u201coperational lore\u201d of disciplinary tradition with the \u201capparent intelligence\u201d of advanced technology,35 and in his planned exegesis of High Tech according to a fundamental tension between visual style and functional performance.",
        "A similar set of oppositional themes structures my narrative.",
        "First among them is Banham\u2019s commitment to architecture\u2019s accommodation of human subjects, a commitment that drove him to challenge core tenets of architectural humanism.36 Second is Banham\u2019s repeated postulation of the fundamental necessity of a coherent visual image to any architecture.",
        "This allegiance to the image often put Banham at odds with the suspicion of architectural formalism he maintained throughout his career and tempered his brash antiestablishmentarianism with a conspicuous respect for certain of the field\u2019s long standing habits and expectations.",
        "Finally, attention is paid to Banham\u2019s persistent evocation of the disappearance of architecture in the face of other modes of design.",
        "This enthusiastic promotion of visual dissipation stands in stark contrast to his commitment to bold architectural imagery and mirrors other thematic oppositions that charge his writings, as well as the architecture he wrote about, with a provocative tension that remained both productive and unresolved throughout his oeuvre.",
        "Banham\u2019s engagement with these dialectics resonates with other oppositions he made thematic in his writing.",
        "In the 1960s and \u201970s, Banham proposed Homo Ludens, the theoretical \u201cman at play\u201d first conceived by Johan Huizinga,37 as an alternative to the classical concept of the Vitruvian Man.",
        "Just as the Vitruvian Man stood for the idealized human subject addressed by classical and modern humanists, Homo Ludens provided a theoretical personification of the alternative audience Banham wished to engage with his technologically progressive agenda.",
        "Banham often invoked Homo Ludens while rhapsodizing the indeterminate programmatic accumulations made possible by new technologies and made popular by progressive youth culture.",
        "Yet while he tirelessly championed Homo Ludens s distracted subjectivity, Banham cultivated in himself and encouraged in his contemporaries the keen eye and rapt attention of a humanist connoisseur.",
        "Further, though one might expect Banham\u2019s support of programmatic indeterminacy to extend to the objects from which it issued, visually inconsistent works the fractured and disintegrated forms increasingly favored by the architects of his generation found, at best, an ambivalent ally in Banham.",
        "The historian who introduced architecture to the formal juxtapositions of clip on architecture routinely chose visually integrated works as models for the otherness he sought, articulating qualities such as absolute consistency,\u201d38 \u201cconvincing unity of the total effect, 39 and a unified aesthetic for structure and services\u201d40 to describe them.",
        "If visual unity was not readily apparent, Banham responded at times with searing criticism, at others with conspicuous silence, and occasionally with cunning invocations of invisibility.",
        "A survey of Banham\u2019s major books attests to the oscillating themes that pervade his writings.",
        "Banham\u2019s first and still widely read book, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i960), famously concludes by announcing the potential disappearance of architecture in the face of technology.",
        "His Guide to Modern Architecture (1962), by contrast, ends with a close reading of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s meticulous details.",
        "After The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic? (1966), his chronicle of the idiom for which he developed the idea of \u201cbuilding as an \u2018image,\u2019\u201d41 Banham moved on to The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment (1969), Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971), and, later, Scenes in America Deserta (1982), books that draw attention to mechanical systems, urban structures, and natural phenomena that previously had been overlooked by the field.",
        "With Age of the Masters: A Personal View of Modern Architecture (1975), Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (1976), A Concrete Atlantis: U.S.",
        "Industrial Building and European Modern Architecture, 1900 1925 (1986), and The Visions of Ron Herron (completed 1988, published 1994), Banham turned his attention toward more specifically architectural (and imagistic) concerns before outlining a complex interplay of arresting imagery and a contrasting dissipation of visible form for the unfinished Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech.",
        "Exactly how Banham intended to develop his notion of High Tech\u2019s \u201cparadoxes is difficult to discern.",
        "The archive holds nothing specific on the topic beyond a brief description of a planned closing chapter to Making Architecture titled \u201cThe Paradoxes of High Tech,\u201d which focused on the \u201cextremes and limitations of High Tech as an architectural genre, [the] penalties of a maintainance intensive [sic] architecture, the consequences of the information revolution, [and a] summing up of [the] present position.\u201d42 Nonetheless, Banham\u2019s attraction to paradoxical formulations is evident throughout his work,43 and his persistent use of seeming contradictions aligns neatly with the philosopher Susanne K.",
        "Langer\u2019s description of the phenomenon: \u201cAn absurd term or self contradictory proposition that continues to function in serious, systematic thought, although its logical scandal is patent, is paradoxical.\u201d44 Langer\u2019s formulation comes from her influential 1953 book, Feeling and Form, in which she laid out a theory aimed at resolving the antinomies she found to be both rife and debilitating in writings about art.",
        "While many authors postulated a simple polarity between opposed terms as sufficient to accommodate persistent contradictions, Langer insisted that such formulations be resolved.",
        "\u201cThe conception of polarity,\u201d she claimed, \u201cintriguing though it be, is really an unfortunate metaphor whereby a logical muddle is raised to the dignity of a fundamental principle.\u201d45 For Langer, the primary function of any art form was symbolic expression.",
        "In too many cases, she argued, a clear understanding of this fact was obscured by the tendency of writers (and artists) to incorrectly elevate an associated but ultimately irrelevant term in their formulations.",
        "\u201cEach art,\u201d she wrote, \u201chas its special incubus of natural misconceptions\u201d that arises from poorly formulated polarities.",
        "She continued, \u201cThe affliction of literature is its relation to fact, propositional truth; of drama, its nearness to moral questions; of dance, the personal element, the sensual interest; of painting and sculpture, the pseudo problem of \u2018imitation\u2019; of architecture, the obvious fact of utility.\u201d46 Langer proposed to resolve the paradoxical relation between utility and expression in architecture by exposing the irrelevance of the former term.",
        "\u201cThe created space of architecture,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis a symbol of functional existence.",
        "This does not mean, however, that signs of important activities \u2014 hooks for implements, convenient benches, well planned doors \u2014 play any part in its significance....Symbolic expression is something miles removed from provident planning or good arrangement.\u201d47 Banham was certainly familiar with Langer\u2019s work; he even structured a 1964 lecture for the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA) in direct response to the passage cited above.",
        "Admitting that \u201cthe obvious fact of utility has always been one of the stumbling blocks in the critical evaluation of architecture as an art,\u201d48 Banham went on to argue that Langer\u2019s attitude toward utility, though seductive as a general theory, was impossible to maintain in the criticism of individual buildings.",
        "Utility, Banham claimed, must remain a primary concern, and symbolic expression should arise naturally from functional necessity.",
        "As an example, he offered the highly ritualized collection of benches, hooks, and other functional elements in a traditional Norwegian farmhouse.",
        "In these, he argued, expression and utility collapse into one another and cannot be distinguished.",
        "Langer, he concluded, had gotten it backward: \u201cHad Suzanne [s/c] Langer been an architect rather than the inventor of a systematic study of visual symbols, she would probably have said that it was symbolic expression and not utility which was the affliction of architecture.\u201d49 But if, for Banham, symbolic expression was architecture\u2019s \u201caffliction,\u201d it was a necessary one.",
        "Though he occasionally treated aesthetic issues with a degree of impatience, he scrupulously maintained them throughout his formulations.",
        "\u201cPart of the business of being an architect and/or an architectural critic,\u201d he explained, \u201cis that you are dealing among other things (and I insist on \u2018among other things\u2019)...",
        "with visual symbols which are acceptable or not acceptable, for fashionable reasons, for personal reasons, irrespective of the functions that the building has to serve.\u201d50 Thus, for Banham, architecture\u2019s seemingly irreconcilable obligations to both aesthetics and ethics, to tradition and technology, to style and performance were not conceptual \u201cmuddles\u201d to be resolved through the abstract logic of the philosopher but rather were part of the actual circumstances involved in the design of buildings and as such were to be accounted for through the descriptive methods of the architectural critic and historian.",
        "While Banham was sensitive to the differences between the activities of a critic and those of a historian,51 in his ACSA address, he closely linked the tasks of the two professions, casting them not in opposition to each other but rather joining them in their common concern for specificity and in contrast to theory\u2019s necessary tendency toward generalization.",
        "As he put it, \u201cThe production of a properly generalized theory of architecture really involves leaving out the particulars.",
        "If you are going to begin to generalize, then your final intellectual construct, document, or whatever which embodies the theory will have to leave out pretty well all the particulars in order to achieve a general rule.",
        "But, presented with a particular building on a particular site, criticism, evaluation, history cannot proceed in the absence of such particulars.\u201d52 Thus linked to the specific qualities of the object of investigation, in Banham\u2019s view, both history and criticism required a primarily descriptive methodology, with the ultimate goal \u201cto make clear how and why the building got to be the way it is.\u201d53 He maintained this commitment to what he later termed \u201cobservational\u201d history throughout his career.54 And though he often assumed a highly polemical posture and proved to be a formidable influence on his contemporaries, Banham\u2019s principal focus was not to advocate a personal vision of how architects should conduct themselves (even if he occasionally gave this very impression) but rather to provide dispassionate documentation and evaluation of the actual circumstances in which they did so.",
        "If paradoxical formulations were among the hows and whys that brought a building into being, then they, and whatever \u201clogical scandal\u201d they carried with them, must necessarily find their place in the history of architecture.",
        "Importantly, for Banham, the task of the historian extended beyond mere description and evaluation.",
        "\u201cAll major works of historical philosophy,\u201d he opined, \u201cextrapolate present trends into the future condition of men.\u201d55 A historian did not simply document the events of the past but also outlined what he termed the \u201cHistory of the Immediate Future.\u201d At the outset of his career, Banham saw in the immediate future the impending maturation of a second machine age, an era of individually focused mechanical technology and truly progressive architecture that finally would bring about the unkept promises of the heroic modern pioneers.",
        "As he put it in 1980, \u201cWhat had been promised by the First Machine Age, but never properly delivered, now [in 1960] seemed to be at hand.\u201d56 Of course, Banham understood such predictions were fallible, noting in 1961 that current events are prone to \u201cdevelop characteristics which you could hardly have expected from earlier results.\u201d57 Banham grappled with unexpected developments in modern architecture throughout his career, and by the 1980s, a melancholic tone had entered his writings.",
        "A passage from his introduction to the second edition of Theory and Design attests: \u201cEvery now and again the Machine Aesthetic will produce a burst of creative speed, but in general this grand old vehicle is nowadays just sputtering its way to the junkyard.\u201d58 Yet, at the same time that Banham was lamenting the decline of modern architecture, Foster, Piano, Rogers, and other High Tech practitioners were putting up what he judged to be \u201cthe best buildings that are actually being built in Europe and North America,\u201d and they were doing so with all of modern architecture\u2019s \u201cmythologies (social, economic, technological) still intact.\u201d59 In buildings such as Foster\u2019s Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters (completed 1974) in Ipswich, England, and Piano + Rogers\u2019s Centre Georges Pompidou (completed 1977) in Paris, Banham found a reinvigorated modern architecture, both technologically advanced and aesthetically persuasive, perfectly suited to address the challenges presented by everyday as well as monumental commissions.60 Eschewing the often arcane rhetoric of postmodern architecture, High Tech architects, like Banham himself, wagered that the best strategy to produce a viable architecture for the late twentieth century was not to abandon modern architecture\u2019s founding principles but rather to stand firm in unwavering commitment to them.",
        "This study begins with an overview of Banham\u2019s early career and the postwar context in which he matured, devoting significant attention to his promotion of the New Brutalism and his development of the concept of une architecture autre.",
        "Revisiting Banham\u2019s enthusiasm for early exponents of the clip on approach and his curiously tepid response to later built works in that idiom reveal two important tensions: one between his advocacy of extreme programmatic diversity and his insistence on coherent visual unity in the works he supported, and another stemming from his simultaneous endorsement of the immersive experience of distracted building occupants and of the critical distance traditionally associated with attentive connoisseurs.",
        "An examination of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, Banham\u2019s most aggressive postulation of an architecture of technology, alongside competing theoretical agendas advanced by his talented pupil, Charles Jencks, foregrounds Banham\u2019s simultaneous commitment to the monumental imagery of traditional architecture and to the dissipation of visual form he so often found in progressive applications of technology to building.",
        "Later chapters devoted specifically to High Tech architecture examine Banham\u2019s early endorsement of projects by Foster, Piano, Rogers, and others and outline the development of his thinking in late writings including archival materials related to Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech.",
        "In these texts, Banham assumed a staunchly critical stance to postmodern architecture and labored to make a case for the continued validity of modern architecture.",
        "I continue with analyses of little studied late works by Ban ham, including his posthumously published book on Archigram member Ron Herron, in which Banham suggests that architecture might productively be understood to exist independently of buildings.",
        "My narrative concludes with an investigation of an alternative trajectory outlined in Banham\u2019s late writings that points to the possibility of a mode of building unencumbered by architectural convention.",
        "In the pages that follow, I devote significant attention to oft overlooked themes such as formal organization, construction details, programmatic accommodation, and the role of disciplinary convention.",
        "While these themes carry my investigations deep into the realm of building construction, my aim is not to assert the primacy of traditional building in the history of late twentieth century architecture or to twenty first century practice.",
        "Instead, I argue that it was exactly attempts to project architecture beyond building that led architects from the 1950s to the 1980s to reexamine\u2014 and ultimately to reinforce\u2014traditional disciplinary values.",
        "And, in tracing a parallel commitment to rational, accommodative construction from the New Brutal ism to High Tech, I demonstrate that a little studied trajectory of seemingly orthodox works came much closer to Banham\u2019s call for viable alternatives to conventional practice by suggesting a paradoxical mode of building beyond architecture.",

        "Reyner Banham\u2019s entree into British architectural circles in the 1950s coincided with a period of contentious debate regarding the future of modern architecture.",
        "Though as late as i960 Nikolaus Pevsner would argue that the \u201cstyle of the century\u201d he described twenty four years earlier in Pioneers of the Modern Movement was \u201cstill valid,\u201d1 the devastation of World War II led many to question the adequacy of prewar modernism to address the challenges of reconstruction.",
        "Such questions were particularly pressing in Great Britain.",
        "Modern architecture had arrived relatively late to the British context.",
        "Both before and after the war, its proponents, many of them (like Pevsner) emigres from the Continent, had struggled against perceptions of elitism and an increasingly nationalistic political climate to win broad support from the architectural establishment, institutional clients, and the general public.2 By the late 1940s, many British architects, critics, and historians had been experimenting with alternatives.",
        "For example, at the influential Architectural Review, where Pevsner served on the editorial board, a prewar editorial focus on modern architecture widened to allow for promiscuous affiliations ranging from popular art to the picturesque tradition.",
        "In private firms and municipal agencies, such as the Architect\u2019s Department of the London County Council (LCC), the so called Contemporary style, redolent of vernacular precedents, was adopted by a generation of architects committed to \u201chumanizing\u201d the built environment.",
        "In academic circles, the writings of Rudolf Wittkower and others sparked a renewed enthusiasm for classical proportions.",
        "The fine arts witnessed a similar questioning of the tenets of modernism, as interest in the supposedly timeless and universal qualities of modern art gave way in many circles to nationalism and neo romanticism.",

        "And it was by linking the New Brutalism tightly to the ambitions of artists such as Paolozzi and Turnbull that Banham would fashion his famous call for une architecture autre.",
        "Both the New Brutalism and une architecture autre have received significant attention in recent scholarship.5 In a 1990 study, Nigel Whiteley found the concept of une architecture autre to be central to Banham\u2019s writing.",
        "\u201cUnderlying all Banham\u2019s criticism,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas a commitment not to form nor even a system of aesthetics, but to an attitude.",
        "And it was this attitude \u2014derived from post war art autre with its undercurrent of anti traditionalism and anti convention \u2014 which was manifest throughout Banham\u2019s quest for an architecture autre.\u201d6 In a perceptive 2008 analysis, Anthony Vidler came to a somewhat different conclusion, noticing \u201cBanham\u2019s insistence on the role of aesthetics \u2014 of the viewer and in experience \u2014 in the promulgation of a new architecture,\u201d7 and arguing that Banham\u2019s \u201creal agenda with regard to \u2018une architecture autre\u2019...",
        "[was] a call for an architecture that technologically overcomes all previous architectures, to possess an expressive form.\u201d8 Thus, with one linking une architecture autre to an attitude and the other to a call for expressive form, Whiteley and Vidler together rehearsed exactly the tension Banham himself used to structure both The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?, his 1966 book on the movement, and his initial formulations of Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech, which he left unfinished two decades later.",
        "Indeed, many of the dialectics Banham planned to investigate in the latter book \u2014between style and performance, tradition and technology, architecture and the possibility of \u201cother\u201d alternatives \u2014were present in his early work on the New Brutalism and find their roots in British architectural debates of the 1950s.",
        "And though a surfeit of literature on these debates as well as Banham\u2019s role in them exists,9 their centrality to the formation of High Tech architecture necessitates a brief review of salient issues here.",
        "Background To begin, a few biographical notes offer some orientation.10 Peter Reyner Banham was born in Norwich, England, in 1922.",
        "He began engineering training at Bristol Technical College in 1939, but his study was cut short by the outbreak of World War II.",
        "He spent the war years as an engine fitter in the Bristol Aeroplane Company, and then he began writing art reviews for the local paper in Norwich after the war.",
        "Following their marriage in 1946, he and his wife, Mary, relocated to London, where he undertook a course of study in art history at the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1949.",
        "Moving to Primrose Hill, London, in 1951 made the architect Colin St.",
        "John Wilson a neighbor and brought Banham into contact with a circle of ambitious young architects and artists, including Alan Colquhoun, Richard Hamilton, Nigel Henderson, Robert Maxwell, Eduardo Paolozzi, Alison and Peter Smithson, James Stirling, and William Turnbull, among others.11 Sunday morning coffee at the Banhams\u2019 flat became something of a ritual for the group, what Banham later described as \u201can invisible college of a remarkable kind.\u201d12 In 1952, he began doctoral studies at the Courtauld under the supervision of Nikolaus Pevsner.",
        "The following year, Pevsner invited him to join the staff of the Architectural Review, where Banham would remain until 1964.13 Thus, by 1953, Banham had fallen into close contact with two groups that would constitute the opposing sides of a debate over the legacy of modern architecture in postwar Britain.",
        "On one hand, Banham was aligned with the young artists and architects who would form the core of the Independent Group and would author some of England\u2019s most progressive buildings throughout the 1950s and \u201960s.14 On the other, he was employed at a prestigious establishment publication and was working both professionally and academically under Pevsner, arguably England\u2019s most venerated architectural historian.15 During his doctoral studies, Banham immersed himself in the literature of modern architecture.",
        "In addition to Pevsner\u2019s Pioneers of the Modern Movement, Banham identified Sigfried Giedion\u2019s Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton (1928) as a crucial text.",
        "Both authors located the sources of modern architecture in the nineteenth century, with the former crediting the English arts and crafts movement, art nouveau, and Victorian engineering as crucial antecedents and the latter offering technical advances in steel, reinforced concrete, and glass as seminal catalysts.",
        "Though one worked primarily through period styles and the other through building tectonics, both foregrounded historical continuities between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and argued that the canonical modern style was well in place by the 1910s.",
        "In 1932, Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson provided a seminal catalog of works in the modern idiom in their famous exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and its attendant publications, including The International Style: Architecture since 7922.16 In examining these and other works, Banham noticed what he termed a \u201czone of silence, extending from about 1910 to 1926\u201d in the historical literature.17 Pevsner, he observed, concluded his study in 1914 with the Werkbund exhibition at Cologne, while Giedion effectively terminated his in the nineteenth century.",
        "The canonical works associated with the International Style \u2014 Le Corbusier\u2019s classic villas, Walter Gropius\u2019s Bauhaus, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Barcelona Pavilion, and the modernist showcase at the Stuttgart WeiBenhofsiedlung (in which all three architects participated) \u2014 date to the latter half of the 1920s.",
        "\u201cIn the process of creating this Zone of Silence,\u201d Banham wrote, \u201ctwo alternative misconceptions were propagated\u2014one, always in favour with some group or another, that there were scandals to be hidden; the other, the official line until fairly recently, that the Modern Movement is a direct continuation of the Rationalism and Functionalism of the nineteenth century.\u201d18 Banham turned his attention toward the \u201czone of silence\u201d in his doctoral research, with a series of articles in the Architectural Review marking his progress.19 He labored to explain \u201caberrations\u201d such as Gropius\u2019s 1921 Sommerfeld House as part and parcel to the tumultuous aesthetic and political context of its day, and he was particularly attentive to the unacknowledged contribution of Italian futurists, German expressionists, Russian constructivists, and other groups in the formation of modern architecture.20 After completing his dissertation in 1958, he appended a polemical introduction and conclusion and published the results two years later as Theory and Design in the First Machine Age.",
        "If Banham\u2019s research into the misfit projects and personalities of modern architecture\u2019s early years demonstrated them to be lacking in scandal or embarrassment, his book exposed other questionable behavior in the period.",
        "In their propagandists zeal to give the impression of a coherent, focused, and apparently inevitable movement, he argued, \u201cmodern architects decided to cut off half their grandparents without a farthing.\u201d21 Major historical accounts of the period, he noted, tended to be \u201cselective and classicizing,\u201d22 written \u201cwith all the Futurists, Romantics, Expressionists, Elementarists, and pure aesthetes omitted.\u201d23 Further, continuities between modern architecture and nineteenth century sources were not so much a continuation of the earlier century\u2019s rationalism and functionalism, as Giedion and Pevsner had written, but rather a continuation of the academic conventions codified in the supposedly antithetical Ecole des Beaux Arts.",
        "Finally, and perhaps most damningly, modern architecture\u2019s close links to technology, epitomized in Le Corbusier\u2019s famous manifesto, Vers une architecture,24 proved upon examination literally to be whitewash, the plaster rendering concealing traditional blockwork at the Villa Savoye standing as an apt reification of Le Corbusier\u2019s overtures to technology, which Banham showed largely to be rhetorical veneer.25 Banham\u2019s book bolstered a younger generation whose interest in Continental modernism ran counter to mainstream developments in British architectural circles, which had taken a distinctly nationalistic turn during World War II.26 By the mid 1940s, the Architectural Review had begun a rehabilitation of the English picturesque tradition with a series of articles on the topic by Pevsner and others.27 This was a significant move on the part of the Review, which, under the influence of its eccentric proprietor, Hugh de Cronin Hastings, had been a dependable proponent of modern architecture since the 1930s.28 By the 1950s, the magazine had launched its promotion of Townscape, a mode of urban planning based on picturesque visual principles, the incorporation of existing vernacular construction, and an appeal to the inherent reasonableness of the English national character.29 The immediate postwar years in Great Britain also saw the victory of Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour party in the 1945 general election and with it a significant strengthening of the welfare state and a parallel institutionalization of the arts.",
        "Government agencies\u2014including the Council of Industrial Design, founded in 1944, and the Arts Council, chartered in 1946 \u2014promoted a leavening of Continental modern art and design with elements of British tradition, which coalesced, in painting and sculpture, into a form of neo romanticism based on nostalgic and often fictional portrayals of Britain\u2019s rural past and, in design and architecture, into the so called Contemporary style.30 Proponents of the Contemporary style drew inspiration from the socialist realism promoted in the Soviet Union since the 1930s by Andrei Zhdanov and from recent architecture in the established welfare state of Sweden.",
        "Prior to the war, modern architecture had had some success in Sweden, as evidenced by Sven Markelius\u2019s sober student union building at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm of 1930 and Erik Gunnar Asplund\u2019s more playful buildings for the Stockholmsutstdllningen (Stockholm exhibition) of the same year (fig.",
        "i.i).",
        "By the end of the decade, the supposed \u201cobjectivity\u201d of modern architecture, which Asplund already had challenged with his exhibition buildings, was more specifically called into question as Swedish architects sought to reintroduce traditional aspects of coziness and informality.31 In his 1937 Summer House at Stennas (fig.",

        "Asplund\u2019s later works became a model for younger Swedish architects such as Ralph Erskine and Sven Backstrom, whose projects neatly aligned with the ambitions of the burgeoning Townscape movement and were enthusiastically documented in the Architectural Review in the late 1940s under the banner of the New Empiricism.32 As Review editors developed these varied alternatives to prewar modern architecture, left leaning British architects, including many associated with the Architect\u2019s Department of the London County Council (at the time, the main employer of younger architects in London), adopted the Contemporary style through the use of the \u201cpeople\u2019s detailing,\u201d a vocabulary of pitched roofs, brick walls, small paned windows, and other traditional elements strongly reminiscent of Swedish precedents and sometimes referred to as the New Humanism (fig.",

        "The influence of Asplund\u2019s lighthearted interpretation of the International Style at the Stockholmsutstallningen also was apparent, as was that of the proponents of Townscape.38 Kenneth Framp ton, at the time a first year student at London\u2019s Architectural Association School, later remembered the South Bank festival site as \u201cvaguely Swedish...in its overall tone.\u201d39 The editors of the Architectural Review applauded the design for its resonance with the modern picturesque planning they advocated.40 Alongside the architects in his circle, Banham found little to celebrate in the Festival of Britain.",

        "In part, these tendencies stem from Banham\u2019s own famous 1955 essay on the New Brutalism, in which he introduced his complex notion of the \"image\u201d and named Parallel of Life and Art as \u201ca locus classics of the movement.\u201d65 Yet, as Dirk van den Heuvel has pointed out, \u201cthe foursome responsible for the installation never explicitly conceived of the exhibition as a manifestation of the New Brutalism as such.\u201d66 Indeed, while the influence of the young artists in their circle on the Smithsons is undeniable, the respective attitudes of the artists and architects toward the relevance of modern precedents to their own work were sharply divergent.",

        "A key component of his argument was the Smithsons\u2019 apparent abandonment in the early 1950s of the \u201cformal\u201d and classically inspired planning of the Hunstanton School for the \u201caformal\u201d organization of their competition design for an extension to Sheffield University (see figs.",

        "It is not mentioned again in his 1955 essay, and it is entirely left out of his 1966 book.",
        "Similarly, the project largely has been overlooked in the historical literature on the New Brutalism.71 This lack of attention presumably owes to the fact that the house was never built and that published drawings of it are limited to a spare collection of plans, sections, and elevations (fig.",
        "1.12).",
        "Yet, with its brash combination of straightforward construction, sensible functionality, and often witty nods to classical convention, the Soho House serves as a telling encapsulation of the formal and historical tensions that would prove central to the New Brutalism and with which Banham would grapple throughout his career.",
        "Planned for an infill site that had been bombed during the war, the Soho House comprised four floors measuring fifteen by twenty feet that were joined by a compact stair.",
        "The uppermost and ground floors were left undivided but for the stair and were to accommodate living space and a studio, respectively.",

        "At the upper level, the wooden roof would have sloped in from the party walls to a single gutter that bisected the space lengthwise and joined a cast iron drain pipe ceremoniously located at the center of the north facade.",
        "The overall effect is curious, at once strangely formal and casually ad hoc.",
        "On one hand, the patchwork of bare brick, plaster, wood, and concrete on the interiors, in concert with what undoubtedly would have been a spartan collection of furnishings, would have given the impression of an austere yet comfortable environment free of the anachronistic conceits of its Georgian neighbors.",
        "Exposed plumbing and electrical equipment would have added to the frankness of the endeavor.",
        "On the other hand, conspicuously clever details (such as the glass blocks at the base of the bench at the back of the studio) and the project\u2019s insistent symmetries, proportional rigor, and cheeky axial relationships appear to have been devised with a ARCH OF ALTERNATIVES mischievous wink in the direction of those who were paying attention.",
        "The axial comedy is best observed in the basement, where the toilet, lit from above by the south facing bench cum clerestory, is honorifically aligned with both the bathroom door and the prominently placed drain pipe centered on the opposite wall.",
        "Further pretensions, if less outright wit, were to be found in the dimensions governing the plan.",
        "The stair, for example, occupies a five foot square module of a grid that extends over the entire plan of the building.",
        "Its corner position subdivides the front room into two additional squares, one five by five feet and the other ten by ten feet.74 Each of the smaller rooms measures fifteen by ten feet and the larger ones twenty by fifteen feet.",
        "These proportions, 3:2 (musically, a perfect fifth) and 4:3 (a perfect fourth), were among those discussed by Rudolf Wittkower in his influential Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (1949), in which he described a preference among Renaissance architects for \u201can easily perceptible ratio between the length, height, and depth of a building.\u201d75 Alongside many in their generation, the Smithsons enthusiastically read Wittkower\u2019s book in the late 1940s and early \u201950s.76 Architectural Principles contributed not only to the increased interest in rigorously applied geometric and proportional systems by the Smithsons and their contemporaries but also, particularly as interpreted and built upon by Wittkower\u2019s student Colin Rowe, to bridging the gap between modern architecture and the historical past.77 Though most contemporary commentators (including Banham) focused on the discussions of abstract geometric matrices that formed the core of Architectural Principles, Wittkower devoted considerable attention in the book to \u201csocietal meaning\u201d and tightly linked form, function, and symbolism in his interpretations.78 These tendencies undoubtedly contributed to the book\u2019s influence on contemporary architects, who found in it an antidote to the prevailing tendencies of mainstream practice.",
        "As Peter Smithson put it, Wittkower\u2019s book had given his generation \u201csomething to believe in.\u201d79 Equally important to the reception of Architectural Principles, as Alina Payne has shown in a perceptive essay, was the book\u2019s echo of Sigfried Giedion\u2019s writings, particularly Space, Time, and Architecture (1941), in which he closely linked science with the arts and favored objectivity and rationalism over subjectivity and expressionism in modern architecture.80 This desire to link art and science was a common theme among the Independent Group and many postwar practitioners of the Smithsons\u2019 generation, and it was adopted with well known zeal by Banham, who would argue for a \u201cscientific aesthetic\u201d in his famous \u201cArchitecture after i960\u201d series in the Architectural Review.81 If Wittkower\u2019s book squared neatly with Giedion and the modernist establishment, it also diverged sharply from the status quo in Renaissance studies.",
        "Prominent earlier accounts of the period \u2014such as those of John Ruskin, Geoffrey Scott, and Heinrich Wolfflin \u2014 privileged Renaissance architecture\u2019s sensuous aspects and its emotional impact on human subjects, and they showed little connection between the arts and science.82 According to one reviewer, Wittkower\u2019s book fully eclipsed such interpretations and \u201cdispose[d], once and for all, of the hedonistic, or purely aesthetic, theory of Renaissance architecture.\u201d83 Taking specific aim at the sensuous humanism Scott advanced in his influential Architecture of Humanism of 1914, Wittkower proposed instead a humanism in which abstract geometries (primarily those inscribed in two dimensional plans and elevations) took precedence over sculpture and ornament84 If, for Scott, humanism had to do primarily with the body, for Wittkower, it had to do with the mind.",
        "This privileging of intellection over perception also put Wittkower at some remove from the visual bias of Nikolaus Pevsner and other editors of the Architectural Review, who had professed in a 1947 statement to be committed \u201cto re establish the supremacy of the eye.\u201d85 Like Wittkower\u2019s, the Review\u2019s position was bound up with the question of humanism, but their call for a \u201cnew humanism\u201d86 had less to do with Renaissance historiography than with an attempt to humanize contemporary architecture by intersecting it with the planning principles of the English picturesque tradition under the banner of Townscape.",
        "A key component of this process was \u201cthe recovery of ornament, color, texture, and a specific consciousness of history in relation to place.\u201d87 Often, these qualities were sought by drawing attention to the \u201csubmerged third\u201d of town planning, elements such as power lines, advertising, paving surfaces, and other everyday items deemed by the Review\u2019s editors to have been left out in the division of professional responsibilities that characterized modernist planning.88 As mentioned above, the younger generation hotly disputed the Review\u2019s promotion of Townscape through the early 1950s, and the Smithsons, who would later declare to have positioned their early work in direct contrast to the \u201cgoing literary style of the Architectural Review,\u201d89 soon also distanced themselves from Wittkower\u2019s thinking.",
        "In April 1957, they summed up the formal development of the New Brutalism as a search for a holistic approach to problems of human inhabitation that of necessity moved beyond Wittkower\u2019s abstract geometries: \u201cFrom individual buildings, disciplined on the whole by classical aesthetic techniques, we moved on to an examination of the whole problem of human associations and the relationship that building and community has to them.",
        "From this study has grown a completely new attitude and non classical aesthetic.\u201d90 Banham\u2019s skepticism of Wittkower inspired neoclassicism, as well as of the neo picturesque position of his employers at the Architectural Review, is well known.",
        "Yet, in his famous three part formulation of the New Brutalism\u2019s main characteristics as \u201c1, Memorability as an Image; 2, Clear exhibition of Structure; and 3, Valuation of Materials \u2018as found,\u2019\u201d91 one finds traces not only of Wittkower\u2019s intellectual humanism but also of the picturesque humanism of Pevsner and the Review and even of the earlier hedonistic humanism of Scott.",
        "Banham\u2019s valorization of as found materials, for example, calls to mind not only the rough concrete surfaces of Le Corbusier\u2019s Unite d\u2019Habitation and the unvarnished interiors of the Smithsons\u2019 Soho House but also the quotidian bric a brac of the \u201csubmerged third\u201d that drew the attention of the Architectural Review\u2019s editors.",
        "Advocates of Townscape and the New Brutalism alike shared a keen attentiveness to architectural surfaces, particularly to the textures and colors of common building materials, and architects associated with both camps exhibited a tendency to work with, as opposed to against, the limitations of existing conditions.",

        "As he clarified toward the end of his 1955 essay, \u201cstructure, in its fullest sense, is the relationship of parts\u201d in a building.94 With this expanded definition, Banham amplified an echo of Wittkower in his own formulation \u2014 both historians stressed the clear presentation of abstract organizational systems and integrated part to whole relationships that gave buildings their convincing sense of unity.",
        "Also like Wittkower, Banham sought in architecture a legible reflection of the contemporary moment and even linked his idea of \u201cMemorability as an Image\u201d to the centralized church of Santa Maria della Consolazione (begun 1508) in Todi, Italy, the first realized building illustrated in Architectural Principles.95 And though he noted that image making was \u201cconceptual,\u201d96 for Banham, memorability as an image had little to do with Wittkower\u2019s cool mathematical logic.97 As he put it in an oft quoted paraphrase of Thomas Aquinas in the 1955 essay, \u201cImage may be defined as quod visum perturbat\u2014that which seen, affects the emotions.\u201d98 In this, Banham aligned his concept not only with Le Corbusier\u2019s definition of architecture as \u201cthe use of raw materials to establish stirring emotions\u201d99 but also with the hedonistic humanism advocated by Scott and others.",
        "But where Scott\u2019s hedonism cleaved closely with the ancient pleasures of Vitruvian delight, the emotions that interested Banham were of a more forceful sort.",
        "Indeed, it was another quality of the Smithsons\u2019 work, its \u201cje m\u2019en foutisme, its bloodymindedness,\u201d that, for Banham, set the Smithsons apart from other fig.",

        "For Banham, this ruthless consonance between concept and percept, planning and execution, and fact and appearance engendered an architectural object of singular, unmitigated coherence and formed the core of his concept of \u201cbuilding as \u2018an image.\u2019\u201d101 The term image held special significance in Banham\u2019s circles and has been much discussed in recent literature.102 The affective quality Banham described was clearly similar to the images Independent Group members found \u201cmoving\u201d\u2014such as the paintings of Jean Dubuffet and Jackson Pollock reproduced in Growth and Form and Parallel of Life and Art\u2014and sought to achieve in their own work.",

        "Drawing on biological research into animal behavior, Gombrich hypothesized that a viewer\u2019s response to certain images had less to do with the recognition of a represented object than with more primal aspects of human perception.",
        "As he put it: \u201cWe know that there are certain privileged motifs in our world to which we respond almost too easily....Our automatic response is stronger than our visual awareness.\u201d106 Concurrent writings by the philosopher Susanne Langer also resonate with Banham\u2019s usage.",

        "He stressed in his 1955 essay that the concept of the image was not beholden to the \u201cstandards of classical aesthetics,\u201d and even, in its affective influence on the emotions, \u201ccould subsume the pleasure caused by beauty.\u201d113 To bolster his case for an architecture conceived not so much against as beyond classical ideals, Banham invoked two unbuilt projects by the Smithsons that moved well away from conventional formalism.",

        "In his 1955 essay, Banham described the scheme as one in which \u201caformalism becomes a positive force in its composition as it does in a painting by Burri or Pollock.\u201d126 Yet, this was a composition \u201cbased not on the elementary rule and compass geometry which underlies most architectural composition, so much as an intuitive sense of topology.\u201d127 As Banham used it here, topology stood for a sort of unity derived not from geometric integration of building forms but rather from the unifying connective tissue of circulation systems.128 Banham\u2019s use of topology, like his use of image, was closely related to his ambition to develop a discourse for architecture more in line with scientific culture than with traditional aesthetics, as Laurent Stalder described in a perceptive essay.129 The term, which Banham borrowed from D\u2019Arcy Thompson, gave his argumentation a quasi scientific air and underwrote a desire to move architecture away from \u201cunitary, simple, and elementary\u201d forms toward more open systems and a rigorous, analysis driven approach to the solution of architectural problems.130 In Stalder\u2019s reading, Banham saw topology as a method.",
        "Image, by contrast, was the expression of that method.",
        "Yet, as Banham admitted in his 1966 book, the Smithsons\u2019 arrangement of buildings at Sheffield gave the impression, at least superficially, of informal picturesque planning.",
        "But, he continued, \u201cwhereas Picturesque compositional techniques were normally used to build up images of rich and confusing abundance, the effect of the arrangement offered by the Smithsons appears in the drawing to be aloof, rebarba tive, and deliberately anti graceful, replacing the sweetness and sentimentality of the Picturesque with a blunt and uncompromising statement of structure and function in every part.\u201d131 Indeed, at Sheffield, expedient function appears to trump the niceties of picturesque planning.",
        "In the plan, the project snakes around the perimeter of the site to define a loose, pentagonal courtyard, its disparate ends linked to each other and to existing buildings on the site by linear catwalks (see fig.",
        "1.21).",
        "In line with Banham\u2019s New Brutalist checklist, the Smithsons depicted a building in which materials (bare concrete and glass) were deployed \u201cas found\u201d and the structural system was frankly displayed.",
        "With its exterior expression derived entirely from the even rhythm of the concrete frame and glazing joints, the building\u2014particularly in a much reproduced axonometric drawing (see fig.",
        "1.15) \u2014 exhibited an uncompromising and distinctly memorable image.",
        "An altogether different impression is given by the perspectival view Banham included with his 1955 essay (fig.",
        "1.20).",
        "Here, a loose, asymmetrical group of building elements of varying heights reminds one less of the aggressive aformalism of Pollock than the crenellated silhouettes of the picturesque tradition.",
        "Though less apparent in the published images of the Sheffield scheme, further associations with that tradition \u2014 as well as with the neo picturesque of Townscape \u2014 stem from the planned juxtaposition of the Smithsons\u2019 addition to the existing Victorian buildings on the project site.",
        "While this might indicate the dictates of function taking precedence over the niceties of form, it seriously erodes Banham\u2019s insistence on a unified visual image.",

        "To the south, roles are reversed, as the Smithsons\u2019 Senate House forms a centralized modern pavilion within the existing building\u2019s Victorian perimeter.",

        "1.20).132 It is tempting to speculate that these views were chosen for publication precisely because they occlude the existing buildings at Sheffield, thus exaggerating the project\u2019s visual unity.133 Whether or not Banham was slanting the evidence to make his case, his commitment to ruthless visual consistency would soon come into conflict with his similarly vocal insistence on facile programmatic accommodation and drive him in later writing to develop an increasingly complex position with respect to dissonant architectural imagery.",
        "Accommodating Dissonance A trio of well known essays illustrate the point.",
        "Banham\u2019s famous two column analysis of the state of the discipline at the close of the 1950s, \u201ci960 \u2014 Stocktaking,\u201d appeared in a series of articles he assembled for the Review that addressed emerging technological opportunities for the field.134 Many of the themes Banham traced in \u201cThe New Brutalism\u201d are in evidence here, from attacks on Wittkowerian humanism and axial planning to a delicate treatment of the role of history in contemporary practice.",
        "Beyond the obvious tactic of composing the essay itself as a juxtaposition of two opposing viewpoints, Banham\u2019s short concluding section, \u201cThe Gap \u2014 Town Planning,\u201d warrants attention.",
        "Here, he argued that prevailing ideas concerning the city, like much of the \u201coperational lore\u201d he disparaged under the heading \u201cTradition,\u201d are debilitating presuppositions to be overcome.",
        "While he admitted that most people \u2014 designers as well as the broader public \u2014 assume that cities ought to be compact, each group also \u201cexpect[s] to be able to drive straight down an Autoroute de I\u2019Ouest, straight through the Arc de Triomphe, and into a Champs Elysees that still has the urbanity of a sequence from Gigi.",
        "They demand suburban expansiveness, and urban compactness, ancient monuments and tomorrow\u2019s mechanical aids simultaneously and in the same place.\u201d135 For Banham, the contradictory demands placed on the contemporary city called neither for a consistent expression nor for a ruthless adherence to a singular mode of organization, but rather for a dissonant accretion of multiple experiential possibilities and, by implication, their inevitable juxtaposition within the visual field.",
        "Banham soon extended his accretive vision to architectural practice in a 1961 address to the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).",
        "Railing against the field\u2019s tendencies toward \u201carchitecture for architecture\u2019s sake,\u201d Banham insisted on the necessity of direct engagement with life.",
        "Again, he proposed the New Brutal ists as examples: \u201cIf Brutalists reached different and more radical judgments than other architects, it was not because of the cases with which they have asked to judge, but because the standards they have taken in passing judgment are different and, doubtless, more radical.",
        "And those standards have come from outside architecture, and what drives people mad about the Smithsons is that the standards are apt to be different from one building to the next.\u201d136 Here, six years after the publication of \u201cThe New Brutalism,\u201d consistency of approach, characterized now as the \u201cpure formalism of architects\u2019 architecture,\u201d137 has become a detriment; and an agile, ad hoc, and expedient incorporation of outside influences\u2014from science, technology, programmatic concerns, and elsewhere \u2014 signifies a progressive mode of operation.",
        "Notice the abrupt shift in Banham\u2019s argumentation.",
        "In 1955, he wrote, \u201cOne thing of which the Smithsons have never been accused is a lack of logic or consistency in thinking through a design.\u201d138 In 1961, one finds that the \u201cattempt to design by the light of a pure theory of architecture...",

        "1.14).",
        "Rehearsing his arguments in The New Brutalism, Banham associated ^ aformal innovations with parallel developments in contemporary art, inclu ing nonhierarchical qualities of Jackson Pollock\u2019s paintings, which, he noted, had bee introduced to British architectural audiences by Philip Johnson in a 1951 lectu the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).16 These varied sources led Britis architects to seek \u201ca kind of building design which was not only endless, indeter minate, and a formal, but in which every bit was as good as another and could e replaced by any other.\u201d17 In Banham\u2019s view, they did not find such a method.",
        "Indeed, Banham did not see nonhierarchical interchangeability, as Middleton did, in the New Brutalism.",
        "Rather, in the Smithsons\u2019 urban schemes of the period and even in the Park Hill Flats, which, he admitted, came \u201cpretty close to \u2018an other archi tecture,\u201d\u201918 Banham saw a distinct \u201cre appearance of the Picturesque method, which precluded the possibility of the otherness he sought.",
        "Nevertheless, it was the Smithsons themselves who provided a seminal counterexample.",
        "The Smithsons\u2019 1956 House of the Future (see figs.",
        "1.18,1.19) offered what Banham saw as a new approach to producing endlessness in architecture.",
        "Yet what set it apart from contemporary examples was not its seamless integration of technology but rather its clever aggregation of housing units.",
        "With its monolithic exterior interrupted by just a single door and interior light provided by the central open court (and ample artificial lighting), multiple houses could be arranged in side to side and back to back rows, producing an extendable urban system of repeated living units (fig.",
        "2.5).",
        "Banham saw this innovation as crucial: Where Davies had identified repeating structural units that could be added up into a useable volume, the Smithsons were offering usable volumes that could be added up to something more complex.",
        "The concept was less intellectually pellucid, but emotionally more appealing\u2014it is difficult to identify oneself with a pair of vertical mull ions, an underwindow air conditioner, and an area of tinted glass, but easy to identify with a room you can stand up and walk around in.20 Such an arrangement bolstered Banham\u2019s argument against the formalism associated with traditional architectural humanism (by offering endlessness as an alternative to \u201ccentristic\u201d concepts) and simultaneously appealed to its audience by offering an architecture that, while unusual, remained open to empathetic engagement by human subjects.21 While the House of the Future was an anomaly that would not be revisited in the Smithsons' oeuvre, clip together plastic components were studied further by the Belgian architect Jacques Baudon, whose Clip On House (1959) joined prefabricated kitchens, baths, and bedrooms to an ambiguously constructed \u201cfreeform\u201d living space via repeatable sections of plastic corridor elements.",
        "Despite their innovative approach, Banham noted a severe limitation in these early clip together proposals: Services, communication, and other manifestations of interdependency will have to be consciously designed at the same time as the units themselves \u2014 the result of not doing so can be seen in the overhead jungle of wires and marginal slummery of so many American trailer camps.",
        "If the units are simply spread on the ground, then the circulation of men and vehicles among them will become a determinant of the layout\u2014as with the corridors of Baudon's house, or even with the way the Smithson houses stack with their doors outwards, thus fixing the lines of communication along the sides of the super blocks into which they aggregate.",
        "If the units are stacked vertically, then some form of external structure will be needed to take up their cumulative weight; and if any substantial number are to be serviced with water, air, gas, piped music or you name it, then those services are going to thicken up into some pretty impressive ducts and trunking in places.22 Notice here Banham\u2019s dismissal not only of the ad hoc accretion of mechanical servicing but also of circulation design as methods for coordinating the aggregated system.",
        "The repeated living blocks of the House of the Future as well as the end on end corridor elements of Baudon\u2019s Clip On House could produce only more or less orthogonal streets and hallways around which living spaces would be organized.,te vvi^1 resonal I The more units joined in this manner, the more the projec ^ easily can ^ j traditional axial organizations and familiar street grids.",

        "The New Brutalism, from the start committed to disciplinary first principles, had in Banham\u2019s assessment begun its inexorable decline into classicism almost as soon as it began.",
        "The clip on approach swore no such allegiance to classical convention and, bolstered by the unlikely celebrity of the Archigram group and the impending construction of the Fun Palace, appeared in 1965 to have an extremely promising future.",
        "As is well known, very few \u201chighly mechanized future environments\u201d on the order of Plug In City came to pass, and the Fun Palace soon succumbed to the crushing bureaucracies of the English building and planning authorities.36 Nonetheless, a collection of small scale built works appeared in London through the second half of the 1960s that stayed true to the ambitions of clip on.",
        "Early built projects are notable for their pragmatic approach.",

        "The mast, located at the rear of the site, was crowned with a water tower and skewered communal recreational rooms and dining halls below.",
        "The mast, which carried a crane during construction, also supported thirty five prefabricated bathroom pods in glass reinforced polyester (GRP) These were hung outboard of the hexagonal superstructure and were accessed by a continuous helical ramp, also cantilevered from the central mast, which clev erly negotiated the varying floor to floor heights of the existing buildings.",

        "In 1966, his student work had even been featured in Archigram 6.38 The Bathroom Tower undeniably resonated with Archigram projects of the period, especially Warren Chalk\u2019s famous Capsule Homes Tower of 1964 (fig.",

        "Fuller\u2019s rise to disciplinary notoriety came in the wake of commentaries by British authors.39 John McHale, an influential member of the Independent Group, published an important article in the Architectural Review in 1956, while Banham famously cast Fuller into a messianic role in the conclusion of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i96o).40 Fuller\u2019s work regularly turned up in the Archigram pamphlets,41 and it occasionally even appeared in Archigram projects, as evidenced in the accretion of geodesic domes in Peter Cook\u2019s Entertainments Tower for Expo \u201967 in Montreal (unbuilt, designed while Cook was employed at Taylor Woodrow Design Group, 1963) (see pi.",

        "A comparison of early Fuller projects with later proposals by Archigram members and Farrell/Grimshaw demonstrates the depth of influence.",
        "Fuller\u2019s first publication, 4D Time Lock (1929), features a trove of salient precedents.42 The work s title project, the 4D Tower, a hexagonal structure supported on a central tower and capped by a crane, was to be delivered and installed by a zeppelin (fig.",
        "2.12).43 Fuller elucidated the project in unorthodox drawings, including a six frame comic strip.",
        "It is a clear antecedent to Herron\u2019s Capsule Tower and Cook\u2019s later Instant City (1968), which was similarly to be delivered to the site by dirigible.",
        "While it is unlikely that Fuller\u2019s text would have been available to the Archigram group in the early 1960s,44 the comic strip was reproduced in Ulrich Conrads\u2019s influential Architecture of Fantasy (1962), as well as in the widely read Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller (1960), which featured a chapter length treatment of the project.45 Cook included the latter book in an \"infectious\u201d bibliography in his book Architecture: Action and Plan (1967).46 Centrally supported, hexagonal structures would also serve as the key device of Fuller\u2019s Dymaxion house studies (1927 45), in which he again exploited the structural efficiency of such configurations.",
        "Subdivided into equilateral triangles and warped over a sphere, the hexagon also features prominently in Fuller\u2019s most famous work, the geodesic dome.47 Further offering cues to later capsule projects, Fuller designed (and later patented) his famous self contained Dymaxion bathroom unit in 1937; and, in an apparently irresistible provocation to Farrell/Grimshaw, he illustrated an earlier \u201cunitary bathroom\u201d being hoisted into a hexagonally structured steel tower in 1927.48 The hexagonal form throws all of these works into a difficult relationship with calls for a renewed humanism pursued by various strains of midcentury modern architects.49 In the opening pages of Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism 0949), Rudolf Wittkower outlined Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s preference for centralized churches, and he illustrated the hexagon among a series of geometric constructions derived from circles that Alberti listed as suitable for church plans in De re aedifica toria (written ca.",
        "1450, first printed i486).50 In Book IV of his treatise, Alberti noted that \u201cnature also delights in the hexagon.",
        "For bees, hornets, and insects of every kind have learned to build the cells of their hives entirely out of hexagons.\u201d51 Taken at face value, these passages threaten to open Fuller, Archigram, Farrell/Grimshaw, and other iconoclastic practices to alignment with classical paradigms and suggest yet another impending slide into neoclassicism.",
        "Yet Manfredo Tafuri suggested Alberti delivered his lines with a high degree of sarcasm and that they signaled his \u201caversion to Neo platonism [sic].\u201d Tafuri continued: \u201cThe tone he adopts when listing the orifices of animals as guide to the number of openings that a building should have leaves us with little doubt as to the pervasive irony of his intentions.\u201d52 In Tafuri\u2019s revisionist reading, even a humanist of Alberti\u2019s caliber approached ideal geometries with a degree of skepticism and indeed worked toward a \u201cdesacrilization of any possible transcendent principle.\u201d53 As Robin Middleton had described the Brutalists as working with \u201cwhatever fragments were available,\u201d54 Tafuri depicted an Alberti that operated through the expedient deployment of fragments within the urban milieu.55 For Tafuri, the efficacy of Alberti\u2019s humanism resided not in ideal architectural configurations (and certainly not in hexagonal, insect related ones56) or in \u201cinane forms of curiosity regarding first principles\u201d but rather in \u201caction\u201d and \u201cthe deeds of mortals.\u201d He concluded in an echo of New Brutalist rhetoric: \u201cArchitecture is, therefore, a manifestation of ethics.\u201d57 Regardless of the hexagon's level of humanist pedigree (or, for that matter, of Alberti\u2019s proto Brutalism), Fuller\u2019s unusual forms and pervasive disinterest in disciplinary convention were certainly factors in Philip Johnson\u2019s assertion that \u201cBucky Fuller was no architect,\u201d58 as well as in other midcentury architects\u2019 \u201cattitude of extreme hostility\u201d toward Fuller, which Banham noted in The New Brutalism.59 In his influential lecture, \u201cThe Seven Crutches of Architecture,\u201d Johnson paid homage to Fuller\u2019s legendary energy while rejecting his output: It\u2019s like a hurricane, you can\u2019t miss it if it\u2019s coming: he [Fuller] talks, you know, for five or six hours, and he ends up that all architecture is nonsense, and you have to build something like discontinuous domes.",
        "The arguments are beautiful.",
        "I have nothing against discontinuous domes, but for goodness sake, let\u2019s not call it architecture.",
        "Have you ever seen Bucky trying to put a door into one of his domed buildings? He\u2019s never succeeded, and wisely, when he does them, he doesn\u2019t put any covering over them, so they are magnificent pieces of pure sculpture.",
        "Sculpture also cannot result in architecture because architecture has problems that Bucky Fuller has not faced, like how do you get in and out.60 If Fuller\u2019s work did not resonate with the establishment, his influence over later generations was profound.",
        "The debt owed Fuller by young practitioners has been well documented, and the relationship between Fuller and his fans quickly became reciprocal.",
        "By the mid 1960s, the American inventor was speculating on large scale proposals with clear Archigram overtones, and he developed many ideas from the late 1960s onward in concert with Norman Foster, John McHale, and others 61 Of all these connections and sources, Fuller\u2019s modest Mechanical Wing (1940), which Banham presented as a seminal antecedent in \u201cA Clip On Architecture,\u201d warrants attention.",
        "The project \u2014 a small, self contained, trailer borne unit containing a bathroom, kitchen, and mechanical equipment that could be attached to an existing structure\u2014had been featured in the October 1940 issue of Architectural Forum, where, alongside a cutaway perspective view, it was sketched in combination with a tint, a small cottage, arvd a modem ?aincb home..",
        "Vine eau% and Ctymax \"tm ^twAe\\,,ihese lWstffahom admd no reservations about dissonant compositional juxtapositions.",
        "An outboard motor for domestic enclosures, the Mechanical Wing offered enhanced mechanical performance with little regard for the aesthetic integration of a traditional architectural body into its technological prostheses.",
        "Farrell/Grimshaw s similarly pragmatic attitude with the Bathroom Tower sets their project apart from concurrent clip on experiments.",
        "Where the Fun Palace, Plug In City, the Capsule Homes Tower, and other Archigram projects offered the clip on sensibility as stand alone projects, Farrell/Grimshaw took the additional step of clipping their clip together unit to a conventional masonry structure.",
        "Not satisfied to leave this upgraded object \u201cas found,\u201d the architects aggressively transformed the internal spaces as well, stripping out elegant (though dilapidated) conventional rooms in pursuit of the expedient satisfaction of immediate programmatic necessity.",
        "Where the preexisting townhouses offered a familiar hierarchy of served and servant spaces, Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s renovation followed both Tafuri\u2019s Alberti and Johnsons Pollock,62 \u201cdesacrilizing\u201d a traditional diagram to elicit a series of spaces in which \u201cevery bit was as good as another and could be replaced by any other.",
        "Tall ceilinged parlors and cramped attics alike were converted into livable dormitory spaces, while neglected basement rooms and \u201cevery odd kink\u201d were elevated to the role of communal gathering space.64 With a shared technological apparatus appended to this matrix and accessible at all levels, individual living functions were disengaged from their conventional spatial containers to be distributed evenly across an energized, expedient, and indeterminate architectural milieu.",
        "Yet, for all this, Banham had no comment on the project.",
        "The omission is curious, in terms of the project\u2019s close resonance with his own interests at the time as well as his prolific output as a critic.",
        "Part of the reason may be personal \u2014 Banham rarely mentioned Farrell or Grimshaw in his writings, and when he did, he tended to adopt a negative tone.",
        "But the omission likely had more to do with compositional concerns.",
        "Like the Smithsons\u2019 Sheffield proposal, the Bathroom Tower was locked in close compositional dialogue with an existing Victorian structure.",
        "Despite Ban ham\u2019s allegiance to clip on expediency in theory, his silence here points again to his aversion to its compositional implications in practice.",

        "6) reinforces the point.",
        "The project came at a difficult time for the Rogerses, who had recently dissolved Team 4, their earlier partnership with Norman and Wendy Foster.65 After the split, the two formed their own practice, initially as an independent subsidiary of the Design Research Unit.",
        "The DRU had been conceived in 1942 as a multidisciplinary design consultancy by Marcus Brum well, Su Rogers\u2019s stepfather, in consultation with Herbert Read, and it began operating the following year.66 Though it had enjoyed a high degree of success in the postwar period,67 by the late 1960s, the firm seemed to Misha Black, its managing architect, to be somewhat behind the curve of contemporary British design.",
        "Black felt the Rogerses\u2019 presence might improve the firm\u2019s overall working atmosphere.68 Their first commission was a study in which the young architects were highly critical of the aging institution\u2019s organization and methods.",
        "Despite this alienating report, the Rogerses were commissioned to design the new DRU offices in London in 1969, with their fledgling practice taking up residence in a rooftop extension of their own design in 1971.",
        "In designing the interior fit out for the DRU\u2019s new office space, the Rogerses struggled to replace the cellular plan of the firm\u2019s previous offices with an open, flexible system better attuned to the indeterminate nature of the practice.",
        "As in Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s dormitory conversion, traditional interiors were rejected in favor of open, nonhierarchical arrangements.",
        "Conceiving every occupant \u201cas good as any other\u201d (at least in spatial terms), all office employees regardless of rank were allotted a similar amount of workspace within the open milieu.69 The Rogerses outfitted these new floor plans with vibrantly colored mobile furniture of their own design.",
        "Framed with off the shelf metal sections supporting plastic laminate work surfaces, the furniture pieces were seen by one commentator to \u201cassault or delight the visitor depending on his or her ability to gulp down colour by the gallon.\u201d70 The 1971 rooftop extension drew on earlier research the architects had conducted into prefabricated clip together constructions for their Zip Up Enclosure fig.",

        "End elevations were to be fully glazed, while openings in the rings were cut at the discretion of the owner.",
        "As individual needs changed over time, additional rings easily could be added to the system, and non load bearing interior partitions and even plumbing locations could be adjusted as desired.72 The project was supported on a grid of adjustable steel jacks able to negotiate variable terrain and enabling easy relocation to other sites if the need or opportunity should arise.",
        "While the Zip Up concept had been met with significant resistance as a standalone proposal in a variety of sites,73 the specific constraints of a nineteenth century rooftop were well suited to the Rogerses\u2019 unconventional system.",
        "The DRU had secured planning approval for an additional floor to be added to the existing four story structure when the firm took ownership in 1969, but when the extension design was undertaken in 1971, it was discovered that the existing foundations could not support an additional story of conventional masonry.74 The Rogerses\u2019 lightweight Zip Up system was a perfect match.",

        "Adding to the dissonance between old and new systems, the Rogerses designed the three by nine meter panels to be cranked askew of the existing building\u2019s orthogonal grid.75 In keeping with the Zip Up concept, the new office floor was raised off the existing roof on adjustable jacks, while electronics, computer equipment, and HVAC took their places in the plenum created between new floor and existing roof.",
        "The scheme\u2019s bright yellow finish was carried through the existing facade at new window heads and door panels in the openings below.",
        "Like previous Zip Up schemes, the proposal was not approved by London planning officials.",
        "The revisions the project went through to achieve approval unfolded from Kaplicky\u2019s original image to the final built work in a clear trajectory of domestication, as dissonant juxtaposition gave way to clear, if slightly begrudged, conformance.",
        "The final scheme dispensed with the external truss frame and proposed a series of three meter wide sandwich panels.",

        "The panels were supported internally on aluminum arched portals that spanned twelve meters orthogonally from front to back.",

        "Turning his attention to the interior, he complained of questionable acoustics and inadequate environmental control in the teaching rooms and dismissed the central multispace and glazed link as \u201ccuriously under organized\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d He was similarly unimpressed by the proliferation (and performance) of mechanical gadgets, and he struggled with Stirling\u2019s unconventional tactics for achieving coherence within the complex.",
        "In describing the central space, he noticed that what holds it together are not the surfaces that bound the space, but the things in it \u2014 the mushroom columns, the enormous vertical radiators, the elaborately sculptured staircase, and the powerful colors.",
        "In strong sunlight, when external objects are seen through the glass, the effect of all this is liberating, if disorienting, so that there can be a faint feeling of insecurity as one perambulates the sloping surfaces of the ramps (a domestic version of the perilous spaces of the Eiffel Tower), but when it is dark outside and most of the light comes from the link\u2019s own internal sources, the whole scene goes out of focus somehow.",

        "Given the trajectory of Banham\u2019s writings, one might have expected him to praise Stirling\u2019s clunky detail as an admirably unvarnished solution chosen from well known sources \u2014 something akin to the \u201cabstemiously under designed details he had praised at the Hunstanton School.97 In its awkward expedience, the per functory seam underlines the dissonant themes so perceptively noted by Jencks and Rykwert and so consistently championed by Banham throughout the i95os an<^ \u201960s.",
        "Yet in these early writings, Banham repeatedly backpedaled in the face of visu ally dissonant architectural compositions.",
        "From his advocacy of the Smithsons in \u201cThe New Brutalism\u201d to his choice of Cook\u2019s Plug In City as the high point of A Clip On Architecture,\u201d Banham consistently favored visually integrated architectures as illustrations of the otherness he sought.",
        "Faced with Stirling\u2019s and Cullinan\u2019s brashly incongruous elements, Banham took a surprising tack.",
        "True to his impatience with disorderly objects, he found Stirlings spaces at Haslemere \u201cunder organized,\u201d his mechanical contraptions \u201cponderous,\u201d and his detailing brutish.",
        "He barely concerned himself with the formal intricacies that so perplexed Rykwert and Jencks and appealed instead to a traditional notion of centrality.",
        "Notice that his clue to the holistic centeredness of the Training Center was found when he initially failed to notice an architectural detail, at the point where mismatched glazing elements disappear into the reflective twinkle of adjacent glass planes.",
        "Unmolested by tectonic assemblies demanding scrutiny, the visitor glides happily past this irrelevant deficiency and on through the facility.",
        "At Olivetti, Banham exchanged the connoisseur\u2019s rapt attention for the distracted immersion of the flaneur, advancing exactly the shift in subjectivity suggested earlier in the replacement of the Vitruvian Man with Homo Ludens at the Fun Palace.",
        "Though the Olivetti complex was densely populated with playful architecture devices that offered sufficient diversion to entertain less aggressive critics, for Banham, Olivetti's \u201cfestive mood\u201d was produced neither through conventional ornamentation (Inigo Jones\u2019s lively swags at the Banqueting House) nor through look at me compositional devices (Stirling\u2019s rooftop robots, giant radiators, clumsy details, and frustrated axes).",
        "Indeed, such elements\u2014and the scrutiny they demand \u2014keep the subject object relation of traditional architecture firmly intact.",
        "While \u201cStirlingologists\u201d and other initiates into what Banham would later refer to as \u201cthe arcane and privileged aesthetic code\u201d98 of the discipline might enjoy the witty subversions deployed throughout the space, such pleasures, and the subjectivities they sanction, remain, like the New Brutalism, firmly within the realm of Le Corbusier\u2019s Vers une architecture (1923).",
        "In the end, Stirling and Cullinan\u2019s clip on conversion exceeded Farrell/Grimshaw\u2019s functional iconoclasm at the Bathroom Tower while avoiding the Rogerses\u2019 capitulation to convention at the DRU Conversion.",
        "In doing so, Olivetti advanced bold new forms of compositional coherence to stand as an unparalleled achievement in the clip on idiom.",
        "But such compositional advances were of little interest to Banham.",
        "For him, it was in the work\u2019s contributions beyond the visual register\u2014its suggestion of a subjectivity unencumbered by the visual strictures of conventional formalism and its provocation of alternative modes of immersive experience \u2014that marked Olivetti\u2019s most productive swerve toward an \"other\u201d architecture.",

        "The writings of Claude Levi Strauss resonate through nearly all the collected essays, and while Gillo Dorfles and Geoffrey Broadbent each raised concerns about the importation of his and other extra disciplinary theoretical frameworks into architecture, the structuralist position of seeing architecture as a mode of communication was generally adopted throughout, as evidenced by a pervasive engagement of themes such as language, primitivism, essential patterns, and historical continuity.3 Banham provided a glaring exception with his offerings, which specifically opposed Baird\u2019s contribution, \u2018\u201cLa Dimension Amoureuse\u2019 in Architecture,\u201d with invocations of technology, futurism, innovation, and historical rupture.",
        "In his text, Baird attempted to demonstrate the bankruptcy of prevailing modes of architectural design by attacking two representative projects, Eero Saarinen\u2019s CBS Building in New York (1965) (fig 3 0 and Cedric Price\u2019s Potteries Thinkbelt proposed for Staffordshire, England (1964 66) (fig.",
        "3.2).4 The former project stood for the \u201ctotal design\u201d tactics typical of the modernist establishment, while the latter, with its ruthless functionalism and open scorn for traditional aesthetics, represented the \u201cempirical method\u201d adopted by many of the younger generation.",
        "Despite these differences, Baird saw the two works as more similar than different, with both finding their ideological roots in the distant past.",
        "In his view, \u201cthe concept of \u2018total design\u2019 underlying CBS, like Walter Gropius\u2019 ideas of \u2018total theatre\u2019 and \u2018total architecture,\u2019 was nothing more nor less than a Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk.",
        "And Price\u2019s idea of architecture as 'life conditioning\u2019 rested on essentially the same view of human experience as Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Panopticon.\u201d5 Both projects, he continued, derived from a nineteenth century \u201closs of faith in rhetoric\u201d that had caused their architects to misconstrue architecture\u2019s communicative role in society, which Baird portrayed as fundamental.5 In Baird\u2019s view, human society was structured as a communication network, and architecture\u2019s role in society had primarily to do with the production and transmission of meaning.",
        "With CBS and the Thinkbelt, he argued, both Saarinen and Price naively attempted to hold \u201cprivileged positions\u201d within society\u2019s communication network by attempting to exert rigid control over the way their respective projects produced legible meaning through architectural form.",
        "Saarinen, he claimed, worked to \u201cheighten [the] experience\u201d of the occupants of his building through a careful and elegant coordination of all elements in the environment.",
        "Price, by contrast, attempted to dissipate the architectural object into a functionalist milieu unencumbered by outmoded aesthetic or symbolic conventions.",
        "Both architects, Baird reasoned, eliminated the possibility of ambiguity and irony to register in their work and ultimately impoverished communication.",
        "Saarinen, he claimed, treated his audience like children, Price, like objects.",
        "Richer modes of architectural communication were available by taking cues from Levi Strauss\u2019s anthropological research, through which an architect would learn to understand the relationship between architecture\u2019s langue (codes) and parole (individual works); would learn to take seriously into account the impact of both present and historical contexts; and would learn to \u201cdesign in his fellows\u2019 experience, rather than above it, or outside it.\u201d7 To do so would be to offer the possibility of a truly meaningful architecture (as opposed to Saarinen\u2019s empty symbolism or Price\u2019s vapid utility), to regain the power of rhetoric in architecture, and to trade in the responsibility and tolerance he associated, in an echo of Roland Barthes, with architecture\u2019s \u201camorous dimension.\u201d8 Banham saw things differently and cleaved to a distinctly more pragmatic position.",
        "In Baird\u2019s attempt to recalibrate architecture as a mechanism of meaningful communication, Banham found little more than a conservative appeal to tradition, habit, and convention.",
        "With respect to the Thinkbelt, where Baird saw either meaningless utility or, worse, Benthamesque \u201cconditioning,\u201d Banham saw a \u201cnearly value free\u201d environment devoid of \u201cother people\u2019s values left over from the past.\u201d Such an environment might be \u201ccapable of generating new values symbiotically with its inhabitants,\u201d but Baird and his \u201capologists,\u201d he reasoned, were wary of such projects because they appeared to sanction the formation of subject positions different from those one would expect from traditional campus architecture.9 Banham was unperturbed by this move away from the status quo.",
        "For him, the Thinkbelt signaled a powerful alternative future for the field.",
        "Such \u201calmost value free\u201d environments were the focus of Banham\u2019s two other texts reprinted in Meaning in Architecture, Flatscape with Containers and A Home Is Not a House.\u201d10 Both focused on environments that evaded the conventions of traditional architecture to produce an alternative spatial and social milieu.",
        "Banham s position in both essays was decidedly antimonumental, with the former examining the architectural effects of the so called container revolution in shipping and the latter waxing poetic on the near future possibilities of inflatable construction and mechanical environmental control systems.",
        "The constructions of \u201cflatscapes\u201d moved architecture well beyond both the conventional monumental patterns Banham saw as limiting the potential of contemporary architecture and the timeless ritual patterns that could be gleaned from the anthropological study of primitive cultures.",
        "Where Levi Strauss\u2019s writings might suggest compelling continuities between then and now, Banham saw in new projects, such as the docklands at Tilbury outside London, nothing but jarring ruptures between now and then.",
        "No longer serviced by a landscape of monumental warehouse buildings in picturesque brick, Banham pointed out that contemporary goods transportation was carried out in weather tight containers that needed no buildings at all.",
        "And despite the protestations of critics such as Baird, he reasoned that architects sooner or later would have to deal with these new antimonumental landscapes \u2014 landscapes not only bereft of traditional values but often also devoid of buildings\u2014if they were to keep pace with the relentless march of technology.",
        "Banham outlined one possible future in \u201cA Home Is Not a House.",
        "Here, he combined the increasing presence of mechanical equipment in contemporary construction with a somewhat cheeky line of argumentation that foregrounded a tradition in American culture to eschew monumentality in favor of the great outdoors.\u201d11 Such tendencies, he reasoned, worked against conventional architecture and, taken together, might catalyze a radically alternative vision of human habitation.",
        "In Banham\u2019s view, America\u2019s architectural development was one of inexorable dissipation into nature: \u201cIf dirty old Nature could be kept under the proper degree of control (sex left in, streptococci taken out) by other means, the United States would be happy to dispense with architecture and buildings altogether.\u201d12 With a typical nod to Buckminster Fuller, he arrived at a possible vehicle of a habitation revolution: \u201cA standard of living package (the phrase and the concept are both Bucky Fuller\u2019s) that really worked might, like so many sophisticated inventions, return Man nearer to a natural state in spite of his complex culture.\u201d In an ironic play on contemporary invocations of Levi Strauss, the technology minded Banham offered his own link to humanity\u2019s \u201cnatural state.\u201d He continued with mythical rumination on humanity\u2019s primal modes of inhabitation: \u201cMan started with two basic ways of controlling environment: one by avoiding the issue and hiding under a rock, tree, tent, or roof (this led ultimately to architecture as we know it) and the other by actually interfering with the local meteorology, usually by means of a campfire, which, in a more polished form, might lead to the kind of situation now under discussion.\u201d In contrast to the massive and static nature of traditional enclosures, the campfire offers an environment characterized by \u201cfreedom and variability.\u201d Defined not by walls and roofs but rather by emitted light and heat, the habitable zone around the campfire accommodates activities more loosely and embraces, rather than evicts, its natural surroundings.",

        "Where the structuralist approach embraced in Meaning in Architecture led many to treat building as a primal mode of communication evidenced in the humblest ancient human shelters, Banham\u2019s technological take on the theme projected humanity to a time before constructed shelter altogether to identify a fork in the mythical road of architectural history.",
        "One path (\u201chiding under a rock\u201d) led inexorably to the conventions of traditional architecture.",
        "The other (\u201cinterfering with the local meteorology\u201d) charted a radically alternative trajectory.",
        "Engineer versus Bricoleur Alongside the interest in primal patterns of culture and communication already mentioned, Levi Strauss introduced the notion of bricolage, an important theme that would be addressed by several architects throughout the 1960s and \u201970s.",
        "The anthropologist introduced the term in the first chapter of his influential book La pensee sauvage (1962; The Savage Mind, 1966), where he deployed it as an analogy for the \u201cmythical thought\u201d of so called primitive cultures.14 His aim was to demonstrate the intellectual efficacy of such cultures by comparing the language patterns and conceptual foundations of non Western tribes with modern scientific thought.",
        "Scientific thought, he explained, dealt primarily in abstract concepts while mythical thought relied largely on direct observation of concrete reality.",
        "The seeming absence of abstraction from mythical thought, however, did not entail an absence of conceptual thinking, but rather it represented a different approach to the more fundamental problem of finding order in the sensible world.",
        "Where science advanced by means of verifiable knowledge alone, he argued, it must pay for its rigorous defensibility by allowing a degree of uncertainty and openness (for example, unproven hypotheses and other conceptual lacunae) to remain in the system.",
        "Mythical thought tolerated no such uncertainty; it filled in the gaps between observable facts with unverifiable concepts (such as magic and witchcraft) to maintain a closed system.",
        "While such closure came at a price too dear for science and thus typically was dismissed as irrational, mythical thought\u2019s fundamental expediency, Levi Strauss concluded, offered nonscientific cultures discernible advantages, and it often was able to beat science to the punch, sometimes leading to \u201cbrilliant unforeseen results\u201d independent (and often well in advance) of scientific cultures.15 Levi Strauss clarified the relationship between these two modes of thought with his famous comparison of allegorical figures associated with each mode \u2014the engineer and the bricoleur.",
        "An oft quoted passage warrants full citation here: The \u201cbricoleur\u201d is still someone who works with his hands and uses devious means compared to those of the craftsman....The \u201cbricoleur\u201d is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks; but, unlike the engineer, he does not subordinate each of them to the availability of raw materials and tools conceived and procured for the purpose of the project.",
        "His universe of instruments is closed and the rules of his game are always to make do with \u201cwhatever is at hand,\u201d that is to say with a set of tools and materials which is always finite and is also heterogeneous because what it contains bears no relationship to the current project, or indeed to any particular project, but is the contingent result of all the occasions there have been to renew or enrich the stock or to maintain it with the remains of previous constructions or destructions.",
        "The set of the \u201cbricoleur\u2019s\u201d means cannot therefore be defined in terms of a project (which would presuppose besides, that, as in the case of the engineer, there were, at least in theory, as many sets of tools and materials or \u201cinstrumental sets,\u201d as there are different kinds of projects).",
        "It is to be defined only by its potential use or, putting this another way in the language of the \u201cbricoleur\u201d himself, because the elements are collected or retained on the principle that \u201cthey may always come in handy.\u201d16 In other words, the bricoleur works with \u201cwhatever fragments were available.\u201d17 Indeed, Levi Strauss\u2019s bricoleur resonates distinctly with Robin Middleton\u2019s 1967 description of Alison and Peter Smithson.",
        "Middleton did not cite Levi Strauss in his text, but the bricoleur analogy would prove irresistible to many of his contemporaries.",
        "Alan Colquhoun, who appealed to Levi Strauss\u2019s Anthropologie structural (1958; Structural Anthropology, 1963) in his contribution to Meaning in Architecture, engaged Levi Strauss\u2019s ideas throughout his oeuvre and specifically deployed both myth and bricolage to structure a 1978 discussion of the work of Michael Graves.18 That same year saw the publication of Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter\u2019s influential book Collage City, in which they reproduced almost exactly the passage from The Savage Mind cited above.19 Here, reiterating Baird\u2019s arguments in \u201c'La Dimension Amoureuse\u2019 in Architecture,\u201d Rowe and Koetter seized upon the concept of bricolage to counter Gropius\u2019s idea of total architecture and what they described as \u201cthe still shining afterglow of a unitary and holistic utopian faith.\u201d20 The year 1978 also saw an important publication in English of Jacques Derrida\u2019s famous 1966 lecture, \u201cLa structure, le signe et le jeu dans le discours des sciences humaines\u201d (\u201cStructure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\u201d).21 This text would receive significant attention during architecture\u2019s flirtations with deconstruction in the 1980s, but it found little traction in architectural circles in the wake of its initial presentation.22 In it, as Rowe and Koetter would do in Collage City, Derrida aligned Levi Strauss\u2019s work with a critique of prevailing notions of stability and centrality: \u201cIt is here that we rediscover the mythopoetical virtue of bricolage.",
        "In effect, what appears most fascinating in this critical search for a new status of discourse is the stated abandonment of all reference to a center, to a subject, to a privileged reference, to an origin, or to an absolute archia.\u201d23 The crucial term here is appears.",
        "In typical fashion, Derrida quickly turned the observation back on itself: If Levi Strauss, better than any other, has brought to light the play of repetition and the repetition of play, one no less perceives in his work a sort of ethic of presence, an ethic of nostalgia for origins, an ethic of archaic and natural innocence, of a purity of presence and self presence in speech \u2014an ethic, nostalgia, and even remorse, which he often presents as the motivation of the ethnological project when he moves toward the archaic societies which are exemplary societies in his eyes.24 By the 1980s, Derrida\u2019s critical domestication of Levi Strauss largely would be accepted across the cultural landscape.25 But if architectural culture remained unperturbed by Derrida\u2019s arguments into the mid 1970s, its exponents had become comfortably familiar with the general content of the Levi Strauss\u2019s work.",
        "Robert Maxwell, in a 1976 text, offered a typical demonstration of the attitude while conveniently summarizing its distinctly English resonances: \u201cLong before Claude Levi Strauss\u2019s bricolage was proposed as an alternative to engineering, [Ivor] de Wolfe was on to the art of bric a brac assembly as the only way to put visual coherence into our \u2018brickish a brackish mid century world of barbed wire...\u2019 Because our landscape was the product of unhappy accident, the happy accident had to be cultivated.\u201d26 In this, Maxwell illustrated (but was careful not to subscribe to) a pervasive misreading of Levi Strauss\u2019s analysis in English architectural circles.",
        "Levi Strauss did not offer bricolage as an alternative to engineering; rather, he used the term as a metaphor for how mythical thought operated.",
        "In a treatment of art practices that immediately followed the section on bricolage, Levi Strauss clearly indicated his view that \u201cart lies half way between scientific knowledge and mythical or magical thought.",
        "It is common knowledge that the artist is both something of a scientist and of a \u2018bri coleur\u201d\u201927 Rowe and Koetter recognized this distinction.",
        "They argued not for \u201cthe architect as \u2018bricoleur\u2019\u201d but rather enthusiastically promoted a synthetic position similar to Levi Strauss\u2019s characterization of the artist: \u201cThe artist (architect) as both something of a bricoleur and something of a scientist!\u201d Such a combination, they surmised, could produce \u201ca truly useful dialectic\u201d elicited from \u201creestablishing \u2018bri colage\u2019 alongside science\u201d as a corrective to contemporary urban planning.28 Charles Jencks, writing in 1972, advanced a far more partisan position in Adhocism: The Case for Improvisation.",
        "At the outset of his section of the book, Jencks reproduced the lines from The Savage Mind cited by Rowe and Koetter (and above).",
        "But where Rowe and Koetter used the quotation to sanction a dialectical synthesis of engineering and bricolage, Jencks used it to propose a shift in sensibility from the methods of the former to those of the latter.",
        "Though he noted that \u201cthe distinction between bricolage and engineering of science is one of degree and intention rather than kind or quality,\u201d his preference was clear: \u201cThe scientist is intent on using the tools and hypothesis appropriate to his job, whereas the bricoleur or adhocist is intent on undertaking his job immediately, with whatever resources are available.\u201d29 Throughout, Jencks attacked both totalizing and empirical design methods and demonized modern architecture.",
        "Adhocism, he argued, offered a means to overcome the stultifying bureaucracies and oppressive theories that had come to overshadow individual needs in the late twentieth century.",
        "Further, the adhocist/ bricoleur apparently offered the chance to reclaim theoretical territory ceded to the engineer by Le Corbusier in Vers une architecture.",
        "Jencks challenged mainstream modern architecture by invoking such varied developments as electronic communication, cybernetics, hippie culture, the do it yourself movement, and the space program.",
        "He ultimately proposed an alternative mode of design that proceeded not toward the mechanized standards of engineered mass production but rather toward the expedient combination of preexisting and readily available parts into heterogeneous new wholes.",
        "Jencks would harden his position against modern architecture in later writings.",
        "In his influential Language of Post Modern Architecture (1977), he further articulated the pluralistic agenda he had first set down in the dissertation he completed at London University under Banham\u2019s supervision in 1970.30 Beyond its usefulness in resisting modern architecture\u2019s status quo, Levi Strauss\u2019s formulation of bricolage, along with Jencks\u2019s own compositional proclivities, breathed new life into particularly English modes of architectural composition that had seen both enthusiastic reception and vehement rejection in the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s.",
        "Proponents of the nostalgic proposals of Townscape, the brash juxtapositions of clip on, and Jencks\u2019s postmodern pluralism each could find a convenient theoretical alibi in Levi Strauss\u2019s notion of bricolage.",
        "Unlike his ambitious pupil, Banham would remain committed to modern architecture\u2019s core values and resistant to any potential resonance with the picturesque (and what he saw as its inherent provincialism) throughout his career.",
        "Even as he advanced the technological expediency of clip on architecture, he was careful not to embrace fully its visual character and compositional implications.",
        "And if he made his initial ambivalence about clip on known largely through insinuation, his resistance to adhocism and the mythology of the bricoleur was vocal and emphatic.",
        "For Banham, the engineer, the bricoleur, and the methodological distinction from which they were produced were pure myth, the product of a generation of \u201cacademics bricolating theories out of other people\u2019s books.\u201d Bricolage, in his view, did not represent an alternative to engineering but rather \u201cthe way the world has always worked.\u201d31 He cited an array of examples from engineering\u2014from space capsules to Ferrari race cars \u2014that demonstrated that engineers tend not to \u201cconceiv[e] and procur[e] everything specially for the project,\u201d but rather, because they are driven for the most part by profit, that they work primarily with components \u201coff the peg\u201d and \u201cex catalogue.\u201d32 He continued, \u201cEven if, as Jencks sagely observes, the difference between Bricoleur and Engineer is one of degree, then on an evenly graded scale from the one to the other, practically everybody, including the engineers, is going to be up the brico end.\u201d33 In this, Banham reached a conclusion nearly identical to the one Derrida arrived at over a decade earlier: \u201cAs soon as we admit that every finite discourse is bound by a certain bricolage and that the engineer and the scientist are also species of bricoleurs, then the very idea of bricolage is menaced and the difference in which it took on its meaning breaks down.\u201d34 And while the farcical portrayal of the engineer as \u201cSatan\u201d in this new \u201cbricosmology\u201d might offend Banham the engineer, it was the widespread acceptance of this \u201ctrifling metaphor\u201d that more deeply troubled Banham the scholar.",
        "He found the idea \u201cworrying in that it is only a symptom of a general ignorance about engineering among those who profess to tell us what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s right with western culture, and \u2014above all\u2014what\u2019s wrong with engineering as a part of that culture.\u201d35 Of course, Banham was not simply defending engineering as a profession; he was at the same time defending modern architecture as a discipline.",
        "This marks an important turn in Banham\u2019s writing.",
        "Throughout the 1960s, Banham had maintained the position of the enfant terrible of architectural discourse.36 His early writing set out to correct interpretations of modern architecture that had misconstrued the relationship between modern aesthetics and the functional principles on which they were based.",
        "Banham had placed much of the blame at the feet of his dissertation adviser, Nikolaus Pevsner, which added a personal, Oedipal component to his labors.",
        "But in the mid 1970s, Banham faced a modern movement suffering not from internal contradictions \u2014 the promotion of a puritanical style often at odds with that movement\u2019s underlying functional principles \u2014 but rather from external attacks that fundamentally opposed both modern architecture\u2019s appearance and its principles.",
        "Worse, those attacks emanated from a talented scholar whom Banham himself had trained.",
        "Jencks offered his polemic writings not to correct the modern movement but rather to advocate for its replacement.",
        "And if, as Nigel Whiteley has pointed out, Jencks appeared to have mastered many of his mentor\u2019s rhetorical techniques, it was the younger historian\u2019s adoption of Pevsner\u2019s approach \u2014 his concentration on outward appearance, attentiveness to stylistic labels, and predilection for picturesque massing\u2014that gave his writing much of the force necessary to challenge Banham\u2019s compelling arguments and formidable reputation.37 An assessment of Jencks\u2019s writings demonstrates that it was not toward the bri coleur\u2019s tactics but rather toward the visual character of an architect\u2019s output that he directed the bulk of his attention.",
        "This marks an important distinction from other appeals to Levi Strauss encountered previously.",
        "Jencks, like Baird, was committed to shifting architecture away from the technologically focused modern movement toward an understanding of architecture that saw legible meaning (as communicated through constructed form) as a primary motivating factor.",
        "Of course, modern architecture, and indeed its foremost manifesto, Vers une architecture, also had been concerned with formal legibility, as evidenced by Le Corbusier\u2019s careful graphic design and famous visual comparisons of Greek temples and contemporary automobiles.38 But in Jencks\u2019s Post Modern turn,39 the name of the game was no longer the suggestion of idealized perfection through the use of Euclidean forms but rather polyvalent meanings that spoke at once to expert audiences within the discourse as well as to popular audiences at large.40 George Baird and other advocates of what would soon mature into architectural postmodernism similarly were concerned with a broader understanding of architectural communication and the necessary grappling with attendant ambiguities such an understanding would entail, but Jencks's innovation was to offer a catalog of new visual examples \u2014and a growing vocabulary of equally new stylistic labels\u2014for the buildings he hoped would emerge from this new idiom.41 His gambit would pay off handsomely.",
        "Where Adhocism offered precious few contemporary buildings that embodied its compositional ambitions (by necessity given its early date of publication), The Language of Post Modern Architecture was full of them.",
        "Indeed, the page count of later editions ballooned as Jencks quickly collected, identified, and classified new built work and stylistic trends in his popular and ever expanding catalog.42 At the same time, his initial position that \"accept[ed] everyone as an architect\u201d slackened somewhat as he sanctioned not a wider array of design practitioners but rather a wider popular audience to be addressed by the architectural establishment43 While bricolage might have been suggested to Jencks by the DIY craftsmen and hippie dropouts in the late 1960s and early \u201970s, by the 1980s, he was advocating the approach in order to influence established professionals at the center rather than precocious amateurs at the fringe.",
        "Thus, as for Levi Strauss before him, the bricoleur was for Jencks not the crux of a theory but an expedient means to an end.",
        "The character was not mentioned again after the opening pages of Adhocism and would not return in Jencks\u2019s later writings, in which the visual character of architectural form remained the primary concern.44 Ironically, and despite his condescending attacks, Banham would embrace certain qualities associated with the concept throughout his career.",
        "Jencks\u2019s argumentation from the late 1960s would move the younger critic toward a careful taxonomy of architectural imagery.",
        "Banham, by contrast, would move increasingly to engage architecture\u2019s technological drive toward invisibility.",
        "Boffins and the Well Tempered Environment Banham saw the myth of the bricoleur as little more than an attempt to expand architectural discourse in order to engage the \u201coperational lore\u201d of Continental academe.",
        "And as a \u201cpurely academic construct,\u201d45 Levi Strauss\u2019s portrayal of the engineer displayed little of the \u201capparent intelligence\u201d Banham routinely celebrated in figures such as Buckminster Fuller.",
        "Nonetheless, Fuller embodied many of the qualities that popular architectural opinion had enshrined in the figure of the bricoleur.",
        "Of course, Fuller also displayed a deep commitment to \u201cthe dreaded technostructure\u201d Jencks railed against46 and easily could be characterized as a Levi Straussian engineer \u201calways trying to make his way out of and go beyond the constraints imposed by a particular state of civilization.\u201d47 A better label for the kind of designer Banham celebrated is the British term boffin.",
        "Though its etymology is uncertain, the designation has been linked to radar scientists associated with the Royal Air Force during World War II.48 Boffin quickly entered into popular usage throughout Great Britain and its former territories as an endearing description of a clever tinkerer/scientist typically working in secret or obscurity and often possessing marginal social skills.",
        "Q, the quirky inventor featured in Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond novels of the 1950s and \u201960s and, more substantially, in their subsequent film adaptations from 1962, is a prototypical boffin.",
        "The term quickly found its way into English architectural conversation.",
        "Banham would praise Independent Group member Frank Cordell as \u201cTop Pop Boffin\u201d in 1958 49 and, as Simon Sadler pointed out, \u201cArchigram\u2019s self styled eccentricity shared affinities with the boffin subculture of systems design.\u201d50 By 1970, Peter Cook would invoke the \u2018\u201cboffin\u2019 designer\u201d as an alternative to the \u2018\u201cartist\u2019 designer.\u201d51 Cook later expanded on his formulation, linking the idea directly to High Tech architects: There are two traditions of good English architects.",
        "Those who are basically artists, and for whom, the natural eccentricity and episodicness [sic] of our culture has led to an occasional series of quaint distortions of the European traditions.",
        "The others are boffins \u2014or mechanics.",
        "There is that stream of English fiddlers with cars, builders of boats, cannibalisers and people who always seem to have another way of using a working part from the one that you expect.",
        "In recent years, the originality of the Smithsons, Cedric Price, Norman Foster, and the Rogers team seem to have had far more to do with the latter instinct.52 Banham always had been drawn to such fringe personalities, as evidenced by the attention he directed at Pierre Chareau, Buckminster Fuller, and Jean Prouve, among others.",
        "A decade before Cook\u2019s comments on the boffin tradition, Ban ham set down similar sentiments in \u201ci960 \u2014 Stocktaking\u201d: \u201cThe service that architects propose to perform for society can often be accomplished without calling in an architect in the sense discussed in the article that runs parallel to this, and the increasing range of technological alternatives to bricks and mortar may yet set a term to the custom sanctioned monopoly of architects as environment purveyors to the human race.\u201d53 These alternatives often were developed by \u201cperipheral radicals\u201d such as Fuller, \u201cwhose ideas call the whole professional apparatus into question.\u201d54 Banham frequently returned to Fuller\u2019s boffinesque tendencies as indications of an alternative way of working that operated alongside architecture\u2019s mainstream rather than within it.",
        "His praise of Fuller\u2019s 1927 Dymaxion House in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (i960) provides a telling example: The Dymaxion concept was entirely radical, a hexagonal ring of dwelling space, walled in double skins of plastic in different transparencies according to lighting needs, and hung by wires from the apex of a central duralumin mast which also housed all the mechanical services.",
        "The formal qualities of this design are not remarkable, except in combination with the structural and planning methods involved.",
        "The structure does not derive from the imposition of a Perret esque or Elementarist aesthetic on a material that has been elevated to the level of a symbol for \u201cthe machine,\u201d but is an adaptation of light metal methods employed in aircraft construction at the time.",
        "The planning derives from a liberated attitude to those mechanical services that had precipitated the whole Modern adventure by their invasion of homes and streets before 1914.55 The passage neatly encapsulates many of the themes Banham pursued in his writings through the 1960s: an embrace of new structural and organizational principles, an interest in new materials (particularly translucent, lightweight skins), a disregard of academic compositional methods and expressive ambitions (accompanied by thinly veiled jabs at Le Corbusier), the adaptation of extradisciplinary technology to architectural uses, and, significantly, \u201ca liberated attitude to...",
        "mechanical services.\u201d Banham investigated each of these themes and the boffin designers that embraced them in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment of 1969.",
        "In his famous history of environmental technology in architecture, Banham attempted to unseat the primary role given to structure and style in traditional histories by offering an unprecedented account of the role of mechanical services and environmental performance.",
        "As Theory and Design presented Fuller as a hero from the fringe whose bold experimentation offers technological salvation to the field, The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment reserved pride of place for other peripheral figures that comfortably fit the boffin mold.",
        "As Banham put it, The history of the mechanization of environmental management is a history of extrem ists, otherwise most of it would never have happened.",
        "The fact that many of these extremists were not registered, or otherwise recognized as architects, in no way alters the magnitude of the contribution they have made to the architecture of our time.\u201d Underlining the practical applications of documenting these achievements, he continued, \u201cPerhaps finding such men a place in the history of architecture will be some help in resolving the vexing problems of finding their proper place in the practice of architecture.\u201d56 In many ways, the book was an elaboration of A Home Is Not a House.",
        "Once again, a parable about humankind\u2019s prehistoric condition was deployed to introduce two fundamental modes of dealing with the problem of environmental control\u2014 one focused on massive structure and the other on applied power, with the former leading to architecture as we know it.",
        "Banham went on to chronicle humankind\u2019s exponentially increased ability to control its environment with applied power (primarily electricity) throughout the nineteenth century and to lament the bias toward massive structure and outward appearance generally maintained by architectural historians.",
        "Attempting to correct this bias, Banham set out to write what he called \u201ca purely architectural history.\u201d57 Banham also documented a number of little known nineteenth century works with which boffinesque designers attempted to mitigate the foul atmospheric conditions brought on by rapid urbanization, such as John Hayward\u2019s 1867 house for himself, the Octagon, in Liverpool, which deployed a clever plan arrangement to provide an early version of what are now referred to as air changes.,8 Later, Banham examined Thomas Edison\u2019s groundbreaking work on electricity, noting that Edison\u2019s true import \u201chas less to do with the practicable lamp bulb...",
        "than with his invention and assembly of the complete system to supply that lamp with commercially profitable electricity.\u201d59 Importantly, in each of these cases, the innovations were largely invisible.",
        "Hayward\u2019s plan arrangement (central lobbies at each floor) was not uncommon, and the openings that allowed air to travel between floors were discretely screened with decorative metalwork.",
        "Edison\u2019s power network, while having a visible trace in the urban milieu, had little visible impact on inhabited interiors\u2014wiring from the first was concealed within walls.60 The actual light sources that Edison\u2019s innovations made possible, however, introduced unprecedented problems for design professionals.",
        "A survey of early modern experiments with lighting design afforded Banham the opportunity to celebrate some lesser figures (Paul Scheer bart, Bruno Taut), to castigate some accepted masters (Walter Gropius, Le Corbusier), and to extol achievements in America (by Richard Neutra, Rudolf Schindler, and Frank Lloyd Wright), all common tactics \u2014 and targets \u2014 encountered throughout his writings.",
        "There is a decidedly American slant to The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment.",
        "While European innovators (and fringe modernists) such as Pierre Chareau garnered positive treatment, Banham largely maintained a position that had European architects perfecting a dogmatic style while American designers busied themselves with the more pragmatic task of inventing workable technical solutions to the challenges presented by new technology.",
        "The development of air conditioning offered a compelling case.",
        "After a withering treatment of Le Corbusier\u2019s technical failures in that arena, Banham discussed the architect\u2019s fascination with American air conditioning.61 His remarks set up one of the book\u2019s central provocations: While European modern architects had been trying to devise a style that would \u201ccivilize technology,\u201d US engineers had devised a technology that would make the modern style of architecture habitable by human beings.",
        "In the process they had come within an ace of producing a workable alternative to buildings as the unique means of managing the environment, and had thus come within an ace of making architecture culturally obsolete, at least in the sense in which \u201carchitecture\u201d had been traditionally understood, the sense in which Le Corbusier had written Vers une architecture.62 As in \u201cA Home Is Not a House,\u201d American technical innovation appeared poised to render architecture in the Western tradition obsolete.",
        "And it was in an arena largely outside the purview of traditional architectural histories that Banham found a quintessential boffin hero, Willis Carrier, the inventor of air conditioning.63 In the early years of the twentieth century, Carrier\u2019s pragmatic, profit driven approach had him applying his system of \u201cman made weather\u201d first in factories, where economic justifications for the application of this new and expensive technology could be made.",
        "Later, assisted by low heat fluorescent light fixtures, office buildings could adopt the technology.",

        "Yet when you have dug through all the erudition about Ledoux and Malevitsch and Palladio and stuff that has been published, one very suggestive source or prototype remains less easily explained away\u2014the admitted persistence in Johnson\u2019s mind of the visual image of a burned out New England township, the insubstantial shells of the houses consumed by fire, leaving the brick floor slabs and standing chimneys.70 Lacking a visual enclosure in the traditional sense, the house was dissolved, like the inflatable un house Banham described earlier in the text, to a collection of interior furnishings assembled in the landscape (see fig.",
        "3.12).71 In The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, Banham elucidated the technical elements Johnson deployed to achieve his radical dissolution of architecture.",
        "Like Wright before him, Johnson used a hot water heating system (here fully invisible in the radiant brick clad floor slab) to render the space habitable in the winter.",
        "His monumental fireplace works \u201cat the mainly ceremonial level of most of Wright\u2019s spectacular hearths.\u201d72 In the summer, the glass shell marshals elements from well beyond the constructed perimeter of the building to boost its environmental performance.",
        "As the house is oriented with its long axis parallel to a steep bluff to the west, a stand of trees planted on this ridge at an elevation well below that of the house\u2019s floor level places the trees\u2019 thick deciduous canopy between the house and the oppressive afternoon summer sun.",
        "In winter, the bare branches admit the low winter sun to warm the interior (see fig.",
        "3.13).",
        "In devising this vegetal brise soleil, Johnson predicted the crafty dissipations of architecture into its neighbor disciplines of landscape and interior design that would be performed two decades later by the Archigram group73 and, as shown below, would become an important ambition among High Tech architects.",

        "3.14).",
        "All this was invisibly accommodated within a traditional two story oriel window unashamedly centered under the house\u2019s gable roof.",
        "For Banham, the radicalism of such works lay not in its outward appearance but rather in the far more subversive liberation of \u201cexpected performance\u201d from \u201cconventional form\u201d that can come from \u201cthe application of radical intelligence and organized knowledge to the ancient craft of building.\u201d74 When faced with the problem of mechanical systems, most of the architects featured in Banham\u2019s book tended toward clever camouflage or blatant exaggeration.",
        "Such tactics led nearly every building toward a traditional form of monumentality.",
        "The Larkin Building, Centre Georges Pompidou, and even Dallegret\u2019s drawings for \u201cA Home Is Not a House\u201d exhibit this tendency.",
        "And though Banham might have managed to squint through the traditional disciplinarity of Johnson\u2019s Glass House to glean indication of an \u201cother\u201d agenda at work, Thacher and Thompson\u2019s understated \u201cneither nor\u201d approach signaled a more radical possibility.",
        "\u201cArchitecturally,\u201d Banham opined, this may leave us with a curious and almost unprecedented problem \u2014 that of the building that is perfectly honest about its functioning, but offers no clues as to what that functioning might be.",
        "This may only be seen as a problem in the aftermath of the International Style and Functionalism, when buildings were supposed to advertise their functions and exhibit their technical innovations, but we have to accept that we are still inhabiting that aftermath and are a long way from formulating appropriate alternative approaches.75 As he moved toward his conclusion, his tone grew increasingly melancholic: \u201cArchitecture, as commonly taught, practiced, and understood in the West, is still little more than a peasant vernacular, whatever the triumphs of art it has bequeathed to the human race,\u201d and the cultural force of the \u201challowed forms\u201d of tradition, he reasoned, long since had begun to wane.",
        "In the first edition, Banham saw hope that new forms soon would be constructed out of the stuff of environmental control.",
        "By 1984, this hope had dimmed significantly.",
        "\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he concluded, among the buildings discussed and illustrated in these pages, the outlines of a new and relevant language of symbolic forms may be discerned, but one must beg leave doubt it\u2014yet.",
        "Such a development is not in the contract, so to speak.",
        "It is probably true that only when the architecture of the well tempered environment disposes of a language of symbolic forms as entrenched in our culture as are those of the older dispensation will it be able to hope for equal conviction and monumental authority, but that possibility seems to be excluded by the very nature of the operation which has been chronicled here.",
        "The essence of what has been done to temper the environment has been \u2014 at every single stage\u2014the displacement of habit by experiment, and of accepted custom by informed innovation.",
        "The greatest of all environmental powers is thought, and the usefulness of thought, the very reason for applying radical intelligence to our problems, is precisely that it dissolves what architecture has been made of to date: customary forms.76 This polemical opposition of traditional forms and innovative technology distinctly echoes argumentation employed by Le Corbusier in Vers une architecture.",
        "In his closing chapter, Le Corbusier issued the famous challenge: \u201cArchitecture or Revolution.\u201d77 His method for avoiding that revolution, outlined in preceding chapters, was to fabricate the illusion that architecture\u2019s core principles, its \u201coperational lore,\u201d were aligned with the forces of a technological society.",
        "But as was pointed out by Banham and countless critics in his wake, Le Corbusier\u2019s machines a habiter were in fact little more than primal geometries in contemporary costume, cunning attempts to stave off a societal revolution by galvanizing traditional form against the corrosive effects of technology.",
        "It is tempting to read Banham\u2019s challenge differently \u2014 Revolution or Architecture\u2014 with the attendant corollary that architecture, not revolution, can be avoided.",
        "As he had argued in \"A Home Is Not a House,\u201d human beings (at least Americans) equipped with adequate technology were likely to dissolve architecture in the Western tradition if presented the opportunity.",
        "In the fanciful un house, Ban ham offered an extreme version of this scenario, while at Johnson\u2019s Glass House, he found evidence of immanent dissipation at the very heart of orthodox production.",
        "The revolution, it seems, had already occurred.",
        "When The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment appeared in 1969, Banham already had immersed himself in research on the United States, the country to which he would relocate permanently in 1976.",
        "Judging by later titles such as Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies (1971) and Scenes in America Deserta (1982), books committed to the automotive flux of an unruly metropolis and the sublime beauty of an alien landscape,78 Banham apparently had beaten a westerly retreat from the Western tradition.",
        "Yet throughout his American sojourn, Banham kept a watchful eye on architectural activities across the Atlantic.",
        "And while he might have reveled in the freedoms and opportunities afforded by the dissolution of buildings and the triumph of the automobile, he would continue to bristle at the careless adoption of Continental thought by Jencks and others of the younger generation.",
        "In the end, it was to the tenets of modern architecture that Banham remained committed as a historian.",
        "Like Le Corbusier, Banham\u2019s ambition was more corrective than revolutionary.",
        "The call was still \u201cArchitecture or Revolution,\u201d though the revolution to be avoided was not that of technology, which already had occurred, but rather that of postmodernism.",
        "Banham could celebrate an un house, a Glass House, and even the anonymous vernaculars of the American Northeast and Southwest, but he could not stomach the backward looking antics of contemporary postmodernists.",
        "Banham was deeply dismayed by the ascendancy of postmodern architecture, and, as the later edition of The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment made clear, he found little comfort in the largely irrelevant vernaculars of Emslie Morgan or Thacher and Thompson, however much \u201capparent intelligence\u201d those works might display.",
        "In the years that passed between the first appearance of his book and the end of his life, Banham devoted considerable attention not only to the American frontier but also to a group of talented British architects who appeared to agree with his Marxist assertion that if postmodernism represented \u201cthe time when history repeats itself as farce, then it is architecture which is offering to become farcical, not the technologies that have displaced it from its ancient role.\u201d Displaying equal parts boffinesque expedience and traditional elegance, Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and other High Tech practitioners were (and remain) committed, as was Banham, to technology\u2019s \u201cclaim to be a permanent part of the craft of architecture.\u201d79 Though a far cry from the radical examples he extolled in Los Angeles and the American desert, High Tech, with its paradoxical and distinctly English fusion of tradition and technology, appeared, to Banham, better equipped than any alternative to fend off the rising tide of postmodern architecture.",

        "As young pundits such as George Baird rejected prevailing notions of both \u201ctotal architecture\u201d and \u201clife conditioning\u201d in the late 1960s,5 High Tech architects appeared wholeheartedly to embrace both concepts and committed themselves not to theoretical posturing but rather to pragmatic issues of building organization and construction.",

        "High Tech practitioners such as Foster and Rogers (at first together and later independently) and the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership, by contrast, saw buildings completed at a steady clip from the late 1960s.",
        "Even as the worldwide economic slump of the early 1970s had many architects seeking solace in academia and \u201cpaper architecture,\u201d High Tech architects remained doggedly committed to building.",
        "They managed to stay active by aligning with industrial clients and global corporations\u2014Herman Miller, IBM, Olivetti, and, later, international financial institutions such as Lloyd\u2019s of London and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank\u2014that were reviled by many as the very objects of the resurgent Marxist critique of capital that swept through architectural culture after 1968.6 Despite many of its architects\u2019 stated aversions to matters of style, High Tech sustained often harsh criticism for its alignment with modernist stylistic tropes, primarily from left leaning advocates of postmodern architecture.7 At the same time, conservative critics, including the Prince of Wales, railed against High Tech architects for what they saw as a lack of concern for building inhabitants and a lack of respect for historical contexts.8 And though Banham had forsaken the New Bru talism for its ultimate alignment with conventional aesthetics and had refrained from fully endorsing early clip on works such as the Farrell/Grimshaw Partnership\u2019s Bathroom Tower and Stirling\u2019s Olivetti Training Center,9 he offered unwavering support to mature High Tech.",
        "To the end of his career, he maintained a commitment to High Tech\u2019s persistent modernism, which he saw as a potent alternative to rampant postmodernism.",
        "At the same time, he saw through High Tech\u2019s more conventional aspects to discern not the radical alterity he had previously sought in une architecture autre but rather the more nuanced qualities of an \u201cother\u201d tradition of modern architecture.",
        "The Roots of High Tech: Foster and Rogers Though its impact was global, High Tech was a particularly English innovation.",

        "In 1961, Foster and Richard and Su Rogers left England to study at Yale University.10 There, under the tutelage of the demanding American dean Paul Rudolph, both were exposed to a brand of modern architecture less specifically functionalist than their AA training had been.",
        "Yale, at that time, was an incubator of the sort of postwar monumentality advanced by Sigfried Giedion and others in the 1940s,\" promoted in the pages of Perspecta: The Yale Architectural Journal in the 1950s, and found in built works by Rudolph, Eero Saarinen, and Louis Kahn in New Haven, Connecticut, and elsewhere from the 1940s into the 1970s.",
        "While Rudolph\u2019s Art and Architecture building would not be completed until 1963, after Foster and Rogers had departed, they enjoyed intimate contact with Kahn\u2019s work, as their studios were housed on the top floor of his University Art Gallery.",
        "Rogers\u2019s biographer, recounting an exchange between Rudolph and Rogers over the optimal depth of a sunken parking garage, elucidated the change in ideological tenor between London and New Haven.",
        "When Rogers \u201cargued from the standard AA position\u201d that \u201cfunctional requirements of the circulation of cars and pedestrians\u201d should determine the depth of the garage, Rudolph countered with his opinion that \u201ccar roofs looked pretty from above en masse,\u201d and that the correct depth would be determined by discerning how to afford pedestrians the best view.12 Such unashamedly visual criteria, as well as the grueling all night demands of Yale\u2019s studio culture, were anathema to the young Brits.",
        "As Rogers recounted, \u201cWe certainly learned to work extremely hard and to use our eyes, not an English tradition.\u201d13 At Yale, Foster and Rogers grew close to James Stirling, by then a regular visiting professor with whom they made frequent weekend trips to New York.",
        "They also studied with Serge Chermayeff, another European, who would take over Rudolph\u2019s role as dean of the school in 1962,14 and they met Craig Ellwood, one of the Case Study architects, who opened their eyes to architectural developments in California.",
        "After extensive travels across the United States to see the work of Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Foster and the Rogerses found work in San Francisco \u2014Foster at the firm of Anshen and Allen; Richard Rogers at Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill; and Su Rogers at the Federal Housing Authority.15 While on the West Coast, they traveled to Los Angeles to see the work of Richard Neutra, Rudolph Schindler, and Wright, as well as that of Charles and Ray Eames, Ellwood, and other Case Study architects.",
        "In a posthumously published essay, Banham outlined the depth of influence of the Case Study program on the development of High Tech.16 Known through John Entenza\u2019s Arts and Architecture magazine from the late 1940s, the work of Case Study architects, particularly that of the Eameses, was widely admired in England.",
        "\u201cThe appeal of the Case Study houses,\u201d Banham argued in an echo of his earlier characterizations of the New Brutalism, \u201clay in the way they reinforced the dogmas of honesty, clarity, and unity, the exposure of structure, the use of certifiably modern materials, and the absence of ornament,\u201d qualities Banham cited as \u201cthe moral truths\u201d of modern architecture.17 In the previous paragraph, Banham incorrectly derived \u201chonesty, clarity, and unity\u201d from an unsigned text likely written by Richard Lohse.18 The German original, as Banham noted, read \u201cKlarheit, Ehrlichkeit, Ein fachkeit,\u201d which should have led him to \u201cclarity, honesty, and simplicity,\u201d not \u201cunity\u201d (Einheit).",
        "Though Banham would make other errors in his late career translations from German, this substitution may have been intentional, as the valuation of unity over mere simplicity would prove crucial in his late writings.",
        "Beyond these orthodox characteristics, the new work in California also displayed \u201copen minded, experimental, hands on, improvisatory, quirky\u201d characteristics \u2014 in short, \u201cwit\u201d\u2014that offered \u201ca much needed antidote to the cut and dried recipes of routine modernism being taught in the schools.\u201d19 This unique ability to both maintain and challenge the status quo of European modernism caught the attention of London journals such as Architectural Design and the Architectural Review from the mid 1950s and, importantly, of Alison and Peter Smithson.",
        "While Foster was training at the much more traditional Manchester University, Richard Rogers was developing a close rapport with Peter Smithson at the AA.",

        "The results were at least superficially convincing\u2014a CLASP school was premiated at the i960 Milan Tri ennale \u2014 but, as Banham pointed out in 1962, the system met with harsh criticism from the architectural community in its early years.",
        "Its details were assumed, often sight unseen, to be \u201cawful,\u201d and the resulting buildings were deemed \u201cnot architecture.\u201d23 The construction detail was (and for most architects remains) understood as the locus of disciplinary intensity, the moment at which mere building is transcended to become architecture.",

        "It should be noted that much of that wit was, as Michael Brawne observed, \u201clargely the result of the additive process, of the seemingly casual juxtaposition of different elements\u201d in the Eames House.26 While Banham (and Brawne) chose to link this combinatorial wit to American sources, the method\u2019s distinctly English characteristics should not pass unmentioned.",

        "As at the Farnsworth House, these connections were then field welded, the temporary bolts were removed, and all surfaces were ground smooth.",
        "Intimating that even the Case Study architects were in fact something less than casual, Banham noted that such details display \u201cdistinctly Ellwoodian\u201d tendencies, which he illustrated with two large photographs of the mannered column to truss connections at Ellwood\u2019s Scientific Data Systems Plant in El Segundo, California (1966).37 Ellwood\u2019s columns, cruciform in plan, were built up from standard W sections; his trusses were assembled from custom welded square steel tubes and angles.",
        "Steel gussets were added throughout to give rectilinear closure to standard steel shapes.",
        "In their fastidious combination of standard elements with labor intensive handicraft, they foreshadow the built up cruciform columns Mies van der Rohe would use at the New National Gallery in Berlin (1969), and they make the adjective casual somewhat difficult to pronounce.",
        "Each case demonstrated the familiar story of an architect\u2019s stubborn ambition to wring aesthetic sophistication from the limited vocabulary of industrial construction, even at the cost of significant additional complexity, material, and labor.",
        "Contradictions such as these abounded at Reliance.",
        "Much has been made, for example, of the project\u2019s diagonal bracing on all four sides, even though it was required on only two.",
        "Like the redundant gusset plates and overly wide roof purlins deployed to maintain the continuous lines of the structural frame, the bracing betrayed Foster and Rogers\u2019s visual agenda.38 Again, Banham noted that such embellishment of structural necessity for aesthetic reasons could be found in Southern California: \u201cIn [the diagonal bracing\u2019s] ultimate source, the Eames house, all the diagonal bracing were unnecessary in the opinion of the engineers and survived into the built design only because Charles Eames wanted to keep them!\u201d39 Unlike his later imitators, Mies distilled the structure of the Farnsworth House to a spare minimalism.",
        "The plug welded connections erased not only the traditional tectonic affiliations to handicraft at the interface between the exposed steel columns and beams but also, owing to the rigid connections throughout, the need for diagonal bracing.",
        "Such details, as Cadwell observed, cause the house to \u201capproach the laconic splendor of a line drawing.",
        "Specifically, it is perspective drawing that erases any distraction from the persistent thrust of its projecting lines so that the play of house and landscape can unfold unfettered.\u201d40 Like the Farnsworth House, the Reliance Controls Building betrayed a desire by its architects to achieve the abstract quality of an architectural drawing.",
        "But here, the ambition was not Mies\u2019s confrontation of interior and landscape through the pervasive distillation of the architecture from physical form to abstract line.",
        "Instead, Team 4 amplified the tension between \u201cthe persistent thrust of its projecting lines\u201d and the \u201cdistractions\u201d caused by the details.",
        "Where Mies\u2019s details disappear in the act of construction, the complex connections at Reliance demanded expert scrutiny, a level of attentiveness typically instilled in architects as they master the painstaking act of preparing construction drawings.",
        "Notice the overhanging beam ends on the east and west facades (see fig.",
        "4.4).",
        "These superfluous projections were the same cantilevered cross heads deployed at every column in the building.",
        "They signaled the redundancy of standard components and implied the potential extensibility of the project as demanded by the program brief.",
        "Nonetheless, budget conscious purists rightly have questioned their inclusion.",
        "Steel in building construction is purchased by weight, and eliminating them would have trimmed approximately 2,700 pounds of it from the project.41 This represented an insignificant overall savings, but given that Foster later \u201chad the temerity to answer Buckminster Fuller\u2019s non rhetorical question \u2018But what does your house weigh?\u2019 with a detailed weight breakdown of the Sainsbury Centre,\u201d42 the extensions have proven troublesome for later apologists.",
        "Rowan Moore, in an otherwise hagiographic treatment, admitted that the extensions were \u201cself conscious, even expressionist.\u201d43 Bryan Appleyard offered the even more understated observation that \u201cthe detailing is evidently chosen for reasons other than merely functional.\u201d44 Whether or not they signaled a lapse in ideological rigor, the beam ends sponsored a series of highly specific effects that rippled through the building.",
        "Observe that they project perpendicular to the axis of extension suggested by both the subgrade mechanical trunk and the north south orientation of the property.",
        "At the north facade, in the direction in which extension was possible, the purlins were composed in a friezelike detail far more indicative of classical closure than indefinite extensibility (see pi.",
        "ii).4s Given the symmetrical column grid of the building, it should not have been an issue to rotate the structure 90 degrees to make five of the offending beam ends usable in a future extension, but this drastically would have altered the perspectival effects within.",
        "As constructed, the purlins were oriented in the extensible direction and are made visually discontinuous by the regular intersections of the larger, lower beams.",
        "The tight corrugations of the roof decking and the fluorescent lights seated in them also ran counter to the axis and worked with the primary beams subtly to compartmentalize the interior into layered cross axial strips.",
        "Coupled with the emphatic X patterns inscribed across the north facing windows, the elements conspired to impede, rather than encourage, a smooth visual connection between interior and exterior.",
        "Where Mies\u2019s detailing collapsed landscape and interiors together at the expense of the structure\u2019s physicality, Team 4\u2019s tectonic articulation placed their architecture emphatically in between.",
        "As the building was demolished in 1991, the effect is best seen in Foster\u2019s meticulous renderings, which, with one exception, represent the space in one point perspective along the main axis (fig.",

        "Photographers, as evidenced in nearly every published image of the project, routinely oriented their cameras perpendicular to this axis within the lateral slots of space, thus exaggerating the perspectival recession Team 4 apparently aimed to suppress.",
        "Given Banham\u2019s indictments against the aesthetic preoccupations of the Smith sons and their allies (The New Brutalism had been published just one year previously), one might expect him to have had little patience for the similar pretensions on display at Reliance.",

        "But as the 1970s unfolded, the disciplinary mainstream moved steadily away from modern movement values toward ecological, linguistic, and postmodern concerns.",
        "In response, Banham softened his dogged criticism of canonical modern architecture and turned his attention toward the work of a dwindling number of adherents \u2014 Foster, Rogers, and Renzo Piano among them \u2014 who operated not outside the ken of the modern movement but rather in what remained of its very core.",

        "Banham\u2019s texts on Norman Foster, the first of which appeared in 1972, demonstrate both the establishment\u2019s changing attitudes toward modern architecture and Banham\u2019s consistently critical attitudes toward that establishment.",
        "In them, Banham focused on the persistent modernist tendencies on display in the work, in particular Foster\u2019s deft accommodation of complex programs with lightweight materials and his Miesian distillation of industrial materials into ephemeral, abstract forms.",
        "These qualities offered Banham ample opportunity not only to harden his position with respect to modern architecture but also to highlight, often with mischievous relish, damning contradictions in the positions advanced by establishment institutions, such as the Royal Academy of Art and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and mainstream publications, such as the RIBA Journal, the Architects\u2019Journal, and his former employer, the Architectural Review.",

        "In the same issue of the RIBA Journal that published Foster\u2019s winning scheme, RIBA president Alex Gordon announced the \"long life/loose fit/low energy study,\u201d a new program aimed at engaging environmental issues.48 Curiously, the study\u2019s ultimate model for environmentally sensitive construction was not an example from the modern canon but was instead the traditional Georgian terrace house.",
        "At first glance, the IBM building does appear less than energy efficient.",
        "In the same month that the award was announced in the RIBA Journal, the project\u2019s minimal exterior details\u2014neoprene gaskets and thin glazing bars between twelve foot tall glass panes and an equally spare cap flashing concealing the junction at the roof\u2014were published in the Architects\u2019 Journal.49 While many were taken in by the building\u2019s restrained elegance, one reader feared the lack of insulation at the coping would lead to condensation and the eventual degradation of the building envelope.",
        "Loren Butt, Foster\u2019s mechanical engineer and future partner, responded by noting that the circulation of conditioned air through the space eliminated the condensation problem.50 This prompted Astragal, the anonymous critical pundit whose weekly column ran in the Architects\u2019 Journal, to attack the project for reliance on round the clock air conditioning.",

        "He countered Astragal and the RIBA\u2019s automatic embrace of heavy masonry construction by pointing out the propensity for condensation and mold in traditional \u201cGlasgow tenements\u201d and modern \u201ctower blocks\u201d alike.52 And, as round the clock air conditioning was required at IBM to cool the computers it housed, why not, Banham challenged, \u201ctake better advantage of the energy that\u2019s got be used anyhow?\u201d He went on to criticize each of the tenets of the LL/LF/LE approach.",
        "Long Life, he opined, seemed predisposed to litter the landscape with out of date buildings at exactly the time that land shortages seemed to call for more frequent building replacement.",
        "The Loose Fit of the Georgian terrace house, while mitigating some of the LL issues, appeared to him ill equipped to accommodate many programs.",
        "And finally, LF seemed to undermine the Low Energy ambition, a condition he saw in the Architectural Association\u2019s lecture space, which required \"a startling amount of electric lights and similar gadgetry\u201d to be loosely fit into the Georgian terrace houses at Bedford Square.53 Instead of the blunt partisanship of LL/LF/LE, Banham advocated a studied, case by case approach, which conveniently came down on the side of Short Life/Tight Fit/High Energy and indicated his own preferences even as he endeavored to give a fairer account of the problem at hand.",
        "For Banham, the RIBA\u2019s LL/LF/LE study was nothing more than a partisan retrenchment in traditional design; it was less concerned with the sober analysis of the problems of environmental management than with positioning a preselected, neo Georgian solution.",
        "And the group\u2019s inherent contradictions, which foreclosed design tactics that might combine traditional and modern methods, were too damaging to be left unchallenged.",

        "But with its irregular, site derived massing, the project seems less beholden to the strictures of modern architecture than to the neopicturesque sequences of Townscape.S5 According to the partisan logic of the day, Banham opined, abstract glass boxes were associated with an indifferent modern architecture that flagrantly consumed scarce energy resources, while looser shapes were associated with \u201cthe Contextual, \u2018herbivore\u2019 approach\u201d that had come to be associated with energy conservation.",
        "But, as Banham pointed out, the deep floor plates at Willis Faber provided an energy efficient ratio between enclosing glass and enclosed volume, while the turf roof offered ample insulation.",
        "He delighted in this incongruous combination of high modernism and low vernacular: \u201cturf on top of a high technology building full of air conditioning, escalators, computers, and stuff? Once again, separate expectations, different architectural languages, have been shotgun married without apology or regard for the niceties of academic discourse.\u201d Much of his pleasure stemmed from the inherent orthodoxy of this apparently ad hoc solution.",

        "\u201cCome off it!\u201d he retorted, before delivering his stern conclusion: Two such facades facing one another would not (just) reflect a lack of crafts manly detail on both sides of the street but also\u2014as in all facing mirror situations\u2014the viewer repeated to infinity in both directions.",

        "Perhaps it is not flattering to see a bankrupt ideological position reflected to infinity.",
        "Perhaps they should put turf on their heads and see if that looks any better.58 Banham regularly combined such careful observation of architectural facts with cheeky criticism of establishment positions in his contributions to New Society.59 A more serious tone can be found in a 1979 treatment of Foster\u2019s work in which Banham made a forceful case for the persistence of modern architecture.",
        "He opened with a succinct statement of the contemporary condition, which doubled as a tacit response to Charles Jencks, whose Language of Post Modern Architecture was enjoying a successful reception at the time: The collapse of the Modern Movement, when it finally happened, proved not to be as much fun as had been anticipated.",
        "The brave new post modern world of stylistic pluralism, popular participation, architecture for its own sake, and all the rest of it, coincided with an economic recession that left the new avant/ arriere garde impotent to build.",
        "Even so, the most galling aspect of their unrealized millennium must be that \u201cthat old modern architecture\u201d survived as the dominant element in the new pluralism, is still producing the best buildings that are actually being built in Europe and North America, and is building them with its mythologies (social, economic, technological) still intact.60 fig.",

        "Neither high nor low tech, Foster employed what Banham refers to as \u201cappropriate technology\u201d fitted to the task at hand.",

        "And while these restrained buildings might stand as appropriate models for \u201cnine to five\u201d practice, it was Piano + Rogers\u2019s monumental work at the Plateau Beaubourg that, for Banham, best demonstrated the enduring efficacy of modern architecture.",

        "In his assessment, the megastructure movement owed much to Archigram projects such as Peter Cook\u2019s Plug In City, and, with many representative projects in the movement adopting an aesthetic of rough concrete frames infilled with fine grain and apparently (if not often actually) interchangeable pieces, it also seemed to absorb many of the qualities associated with the New Brutalism.63 Banham\u2019s treatment of projects by the Archigram group and others in that book are dealt with in a later chapter.",
        "At this point in the narrative, it will suffice to point out that Centre Pompidou\u2019s boldly exposed structure and mechanical equipment were rendered in the bright hues typical of Archigram projects, and that the project bore a strong resemblance to the radical proposals of the 1960s.64 Though Banham found it to be \u201ca shade less adventurous than the Fun Palace\u201d and \u201cfar less freeform and participatory\u201d than Constant Nieuwenhuys\u2019s New Babylon,65 it secured its place as the culmination of the megastructure movement through its remarkable visual imagery.",
        "As he put it, Centre Pompidou \u201cwill be perceived to be a megastructure [because] it answers the ultimate acid test of looking like one.\u201d66 For Banham, such strong visual qualities were crucial to the megastructure movement.",

        "The movement\u2019s development and ultimate rejection in the wake of 1968, he surmised, did not result from outside forces (whether social, political, or economic) but rather from forces internal to the discipline.",

        "This fact surely accounts for the pathos that colors Ban ham\u2019s writings of the mid 1970s and 80s, which were published as those values saw decreasing efficacy in global architectural culture.",
        "It also helps to explain Banham\u2019s slow shift from aggressive critic of the modern establishment in the 1950s and \u201960s to one of modern architecture\u2019s most dependable apologist in the 1970s and \u201980s.",
        "Centre Pompidou opened to the public on 31 January 1977.",
        "In May of that year, the Architectural Review dedicated its cover and twenty four pages to the project, with Banham providing the critical commentary.",
        "In a short editorial, the Review\u2019s editors described \u201ca menacing building which stands like a man in full armour in a room full of civilians\u201d before arriving at a familiar conclusion: \u201cOne Centre Pompidou (like one Faber Dumas in Ipswich) is an exhilarating sight; but only contemplate what the centers of our cities would be like if they were chiefly composed of buildings of this kind and you will see what a repellant fix we could be in.\u201d The text continued with a dismissal of exactly what Banham had celebrated in the design a year earlier: The Centre reflects the supreme moment of technological euphoria in Western society: the moment when we genuinely believed that \u201cfreedom\u201d was to be got by providing ourselves with endless power supplied facility: with servicing which would be so elaborate and so heavily duplicated that you could do anything you want, any where, at any time.",
        "We are wiser now; for we know that even if our resources allowed this sort of indulgence, the political machinery we would have to forge to operate it would be so offensive that it would remove true freedom from the face of the earth.",
        "This is why there is no reason to expect a multiplicity of Pompidou like buildings; and why there is no call to agonize too much about the political implications of such a structure.70 The Review\u2019s admonitions might as well have been directed at Banham himself.",
        "For over a decade, Banham had been advocating technologically assisted anywhere/ anytime freedom, and had been heaping scorn on establishment pundits who had turned their backs on such ambitions.",
        "His Review essay holds true to form.",
        "Rather than characterize the building as the end of the line (as he had done in Megastructure\u2019s melancholy conclusion), he read it as the basis of a resurgent modern architecture that \u201cseems to have taken its revenge on two generations of academic doubters, intellectual Luddites, and all those energetic breast beaters who nowadays contribute to the comic pages at the beginning of the AR.\u201d71 Banham\u2019s arguments were particularly cunning.",
        "Adhering to a pattern he would follow often in his late career writing, he linked Pompidou tightly to the founding ambitions of the modern movement.",
        "But in tracing a genealogy somewhat different from the typical path trod by adherents of the International Style, Banham crafted a version of modern architecture that cleaved much more closely to the aspirations and ambitions of the radical works he had advocated in the 1960s.",
        "His argument turned around the question of monumentality, in particular the version of it advanced by Sigfried Giedion, Fernand Leger, and Jose Luis Sert in their influential essay \u201cNine Points on Monumentality.\u201d Though Giedion had been a stern critic of Archigram and their contemporaries,72 his 1943 program for monumentality eerily resonated with Centre Pompidou: \u201cModern materials and new techniques are at hand: light metal structures; curved, laminated wood arches; panels of different textures, colors, and sizes; light elements like ceiling which can be suspended from big trusses covering practically unlimited spans.\u201d73 This, Banham was quick to point out, was not the sort of monumentality that was typically associated with modern architecture in the 1970s, a situation he blamed on Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cincreasingly geriatric understanding of monumentality as mere mass and impenetrable substance.\u201d While Banham provides a judicious caveat,74 the point was clear: Piano + Rogers\u2019s was \u201ca vision that is quintessential to the Modern Movement.\u201d Turning his attention to Pompidou\u2019s relation to megastructure, Banham again distanced the facility\u2019s lightweight flexibility from the brooding concrete of other constructed megastructures such as Geoffrey Copcutt\u2019s Cumbernauld Town Center (1960).",
        "And, in a shotgun wedding that can only be seen as shocking, Banham joined Giedion and Archigram with a separatrix in support of 1960s ambitions: \u201cWhat sets it [Centre Pompidou] apart from Cumbernauld, however, is its aesthetic\u2014 Geoffrey Copcutt\u2019s design, however brilliant, was lumbered (willingly, no doubt) with that ponderous Corbusian monumentality of mere mass, whereas Pompidou\u2019s Giedion/Archigram transparency and color seem even truer nowadays to the departed aspirations of \u2018the swinging \u201960s.\u2019\u201d75 Having linked Pompidou and Archigram through Giedion to core modern movement values (and nudged Le Corbusier away from them in the process), Banham turned his sights toward more recent impediments to the resurgence of the movement.",
        "And like his enlisting of Giedion to his cause, his use of the Centre Pompidou\u2019s brash assemblage of mechanistic parts to take a critical swing at Charles Jencks\u2019s concept of adhocism is at first blush counterintuitive.",
        "His point turned about the detailing of the Pompidou\u2019s glazed enclosure.",
        "In the original design, as in the constructed building, mechanical equipment and structural steel were held outside of the glass facades or above the ceilings to provide maximum interior flexibility (see fig.",
        "4.13).",
        "While Banham appeared somewhat less than convinced by the complexity of the building\u2019s structure, he was blunt in his criticism of modifications to the glass skin required to meet city fire regulations.",
        "The original design called for a smooth envelope of curtain wall glazing slipped behind the main exterior columns.",
        "In the final scheme, opaque panels of heat resistant material were required to be added at each column as well as across the upper portion of the glazing at each floor level (see fig.",
        "4.14).",
        "A battery of fire sprinklers and emergency shutters also were added.",
        "For Banham, these late additions conspired to ruin the pristine skin promised by the original design.76 His disapproval was unequivocal: \u201cI find myself stunned that a design team that had poured so much inventiveness into setting up that very pure concept in the first place, should allow it to be ad hocked to pieces in the last resort.\u201d Banham pursued this admonition more broadly in the next section: \u201cAd hocism, of course, is somewhat in fashion at present, and will always have a big place in the art of design, but its visible presence at Pompidou is curiously disturbing.",
        "It is conspicuously inappropriate to a design which otherwise has avoided manifest compromise.\u201d77 These are strange lines to come from the author of \u201cA Clip On Architecture.\u201d Indeed, the ad hoc assembly of elements also had been in fashion in the 1960s, and much of the most celebrated work of the period was characterized by the expedient combination of dissonant parts.",
        "Of course, Banham had an ambivalent relationship to such tactics even then, and he was always careful to differentiate between visual and programmatic dissonance.",
        "Observe his careful early description of Piano + Rogers\u2019s second scheme for Pompidou, which \u201ccomes closer to Plug In City in its visible open frames, with communications etc.",
        "threaded through them, and even more so in the graphic detailing and the ad hoc transient function implications of the very large presentation drawings that were made for it.\u201d78 Notice that only the \u201ctransient function implications\u201d are described as ad hoc.",
        "The \u201cgraphic detailing,\u201d consistent with Archigram\u2019s own, proved to be fastidious, precise, and carefully coordinated.",
        "Banham was quick to celebrate immersive milieus such as the Plateau Beau bourg.",
        "Recall, for example, his vivid descriptions of a near future Paris, in which highway convenience and the urbanity of Gigi were combined on the Champs Elysees;79 the Fun Palace, in which a \u201cmechanized shrine to Homo Ludens\u201d accommodated \u201cpolitical rallies...Greco Roman wrestling, table tennis, choral song, dervish dancing, model drag racing or just goofing and falling about\u201d;80 Archigram\u2019s drawings, in which \u201cdolly girls\u201d twist[ed] and \u201cfrug[ged],\u201d families promenaded, children danced, and crowds surged;81 and the un house, in which Dionne Warwick sang, protein turned, and cocktails poured in the mechanically enhanced comfort of the great outdoors.82 Banham delivered some of his most lyrical passages as vibrant carnivals of images and activities held in unlikely proximity by little more than serial commas.",
        "Of course, those commas were crucial.",
        "Though he often peppered his sentences with neologisms and custom hyphenated constructions, Banham always respected the grammatical conventions of English usage.",
        "Consistently lucid and often exuberant, his writing, like the work he championed, is fastidious, precise, and carefully coordinated.",
        "And, as anyone who has attempted to paraphrase it can attest, it is also impressively efficient.",
        "Banham was hard on himself when it came to his prose,83 and he was hard on the subjects of that prose when they failed to live up to the high standards he demanded.",
        "Above all, Banham praised precision, efficiency, and thorough coordination in the objects he examined.",
        "Adhocism offered an easy shortcut by which to bypass these requirements and thus could only be seen as an offense.",
        "While he once might have suggested the rejection of \u201cthe accepted rules of architecture\u2014symmetry, unity, coherence, balance, and all of those,\u201d84 Banham would never relinquish his taste for efficiency, rigor, and conviction.",
        "These qualities, for the most part, were what he found at Centre Pompidou.",
        "And it was these qualities that raised the enigmatic questions with which Banham concluded his essay.",
        "One question was operational.",
        "For if the facility had been commissioned and designed to accommodate adaptable flexibility, critics could no longer hold the architects solely responsible for the work\u2019s quality, \u201cthe question of management will qualify all attempts to judge whether the Centre is functionally adequate.\u201d85 The other question was symbolic: \u201cCentre Pompidou is clearly a monument, a very permanent monument presenting what is already a fixed image to outward view, and few of the routine modifications that might be adapted to its services and other externals is likely to have much effect on that fixed image of transparency and tracery, bright color and mechanical equipment.",
        "But can one have a permanent image of change?\u201d The question encapsulated a central paradox of High Tech architecture as well as Banham\u2019s own writing\u2014a contradictory drive to cleave to the monumental values of traditional architecture and simultaneously to advance an \u201cother\u201d set of values characterized by flexibility and change.",

        "In the months leading up to his death, he had been at work on his own book length assessment of the movement.",
        "Though the final form and specific content of the book remained unsettled, Banham offered his \u201ccurrent thinking on the subject in a letter to his publisher and an attached summary, outline, and draft introductory chapter.16 In the summary, Banham established Centre Pompidou as \u201cA Monument of Definition.\u201d17 From it, he gleaned five \u201ccanonical characteristics,\u201d which he developed as the \u201cElements and Origins of the Canon.\u201d The first, wide span construction connected High Tech to \u201cthe most central tradition of the modern movement, one which has the warrant of [Peter] Behrens, [Eugene] Freyssinet, Fuller, [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe among designers, and [Sigfried] Giedion, [Nikolaus] Pevsner, and others among writers.\u201d18 Next, he pointed out the necessity of a \u201chigh level of mechanical servicing,\u201d which, as he had argued in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, \u201chas no such place in the explicit traditions of the modern movement, in spite of the fact that most modern buildings would be un inhabitable without it.\u201d The third characteristic, \u201cexpressed structure,\u201d raised questions about the nature of architecture\u2019s interactions with engineering practice, while the fourth, \u201cexhibiting the services,\u201d seemed to represent \u201ca very different achievement, and one for which the architects are almost solely responsible.\u201d The culmination of these factors resulted in \u201cthe invention of a unified aesthetic for structure and services\u201d with roots deep in the modern movement.19 Banham\u2019s intent to concentrate on visual style is apparent throughout.",
        "\u201cThe crucial stages in accommodating the art of architecture to advances in technology,\u201d he opined, \u201chave always been stylistic.\u201d20 In the modern movement, it was Mies van der Rohe who \u201cestablished] the kind of standard by which most other architectural excursions into higher technology are judged.\u201d21 For while \u201c[Auguste] Perret forced an old aesthetic on concrete, and Le Corbusier forced a new one on it, Mies discovered a new mode of expression within steel construction.\u201d22 Working in the same manner but with different technologies, High Tech architects seemed to offer the possibility of once again discovering a new aesthetic in the expression of mechanical services.",
        "Yet, as he argued in a section on \u201cAn Opposite Case,\u201d such reasoning failed to account for a project such as Foster\u2019s Willis Faber & Dumas Headquarters, \u201cwhich reveals nothing at all of its structure or workings, and yet tends to get classified as High Tech.\u201d Suggesting that recent computer controlled \u201cSmart Buildings\u201d might indicate the terrain for architecture\u2019s next engagement with high technology, he suggested these projects \u201cmay prefigure an even higher form of High Tech.\u201d23 In a final section, on the \u201cScope of the Study,\u201d he outlined his intention to examine existing literature on High Tech, larger issues pertaining to modernism in general, and \u201chostile commentary by supporters of the Post Modernist position.\u201d For Banham, High Tech and modernism were intertwined and require parallel exposition.",
        "High Tech, he concluded, \u201chas raised questions that are fundamental both to Modernism and to Architecture.\u201d24 Thus, Banham planned a book sharply differentiated from the writings of previous commentators.",
        "Where Kron and Slesin saw the superficial trappings of a fashionable new decorative idiom, Banham saw profound implications for the history of modern architecture.",
        "Where Buchanan described a regional movement of primarily British extraction, Banham intended to portray a global phenomenon with important American, French, and German ancestors and significant practitioners at work around the globe.",
        "And where Jencks found a nostalgic maintenance of modernist stylistic tropes that paled in comparison to the broad semantic pluralism of postmodern architecture, Banham saw an important swerve away from orthodox habits that developed an \u201calternative Modernism\u201d out of new technologies.25 As the draft introduction Banham prepared for the book makes clear, he saw in High Tech an architecture that paradoxically maintained close ties to the ideologies of the modern movement yet diverged from certain of its principles to suggest a manner of working that might overcome modern architecture\u2019s deficiencies to stand in staunch resistance to postmodern architecture.",

        "Throughout his career, Banham was highly attentive to specific subcategories within modern architecture, such as futurism, expressionism, and constructivism, which he focused on in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, and the New Brutalism, clip on, megastructure, and High Tech, which were the focus of numerous texts from the 1950s to the \u201980s.",
        "Over the course of his career, Banham marshaled each of these minor modern movements into his cause of charting an alternative trajectory into the immediate future to the one outlined under the banner of International Style, which Banham saw as the modern movement\u2019s primary inflection.",
        "Distinguishing the International Style as something less than the modern movement as a whole gave Banham a way to continue his attack on certain aspects of modern architecture without damning the modern movement outright.",
        "This bracketing of the International Style would prove crucial to his revisionist agenda with respect to modern architecture.",
        "Curiously, Banham did not refer directly to the arguments of Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson to align the Porsche building with the International Style.",
        "Instead, he cited the three part postulation of planar volumes, regular massing, and lack of applied ornamentation as the style\u2019s essential traits that Alfred Barr had laid out in his preface to Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s book.29 With its bright colors and filigreed silhouette, Banham argued, Renault adhered to a different set of characteristics: \u201cthe use of...",
        "bright, usually primary colors,\u201d \u201ca conspicuous exhibition of structure,\u201d and \u201cexposure of mechanical and environmental services.\u201d30 These, Banham continued, \u201cmay well be called the three distinguishing stylistic principles of High Tech,\u201d3' and they served to demarcate a stylistic boundary between that idiom and the International Style.",

        "Each category also called for a distinct material effect: abstract blankness and concrete physicality in the older pair, and the artificiality of off the peg (often plastic) elements and applied color in the newer one.",

        "Renault lacked any significant exposition of mechanical services, though its structural system was expressed with bold colors.",
        "Porsche lacked all three, and it aligned with exactly the International Style criteria High Tech works supposedly flouted.",
        "Here, one must keep in mind that, for Banham, visual style was only part of the equation.",
        "Just as the New Brutalism necessitated engagement with the movement\u2019s formal and ideological inflections, High Tech required the historian to consider both visual style and enhanced performance.",
        "Importantly, and in sharp contrast to his earlier argumentation in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, \u201cA Home Is Not a House,\u201d The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, and elsewhere, Banham cautioned that this commitment to technologically enhanced performance did not imply a move away from architecture as a discipline.",
        "High Tech, he reminded his readers, was \u201cstill architecture, \u2018the mother of the arts,\u2019 with all that is implied in that traditional claim.\u201d35 Banham ended his essay by returning to the famous closing passage of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, in which the technologically engaged architect may be required to \u201cdiscard his whole cultural load including the professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect\u201d in order to keep pace with technology.36 In stark contrast to one of his most oft quoted lines, Banham argued in his introduction that High Tech, the direct inheritor of the attitudes he had outlined nearly thirty years earlier, demonstrated \u201chow far some architects were prepared to go, in defiance of a rising tide of historical revivalism, in order to keep up with advanced engineering, but without divesting themselves of those \u2018professional garments.\u2019\u201d37 Positioning his work emphatically against both the International Style and postmodern architecture, he closed by defining High Tech as \u201can alternative Modernism that had arisen from what might be termed the \u2018disgrace\u2019 of the older Modernism of the International Style,\u201d which had, in his view, \u201csurprised the world of architecture by becoming successful against the grain of expectations in the ostensibly Post Modernist culture of the nineteen seventies and eighties.\u201d38 Banham wrote these lines as he was recovering from the cancer surgery he had undergone in August 1987.",
        "Judging by other materials in the archive, the letter, summary, and outline of 15 December represent his final recorded thoughts on High Tech.",
        "And while Making Architecture would remain unfinished, Banham\u2019s earlier writings and teaching throughout the 1980s hint at his intentions for articulating \u201cthis alternative Modernism.\u201d39 In them, Banham demonstrated an acute attention to the imagistic concerns of visual style as well as to the often invisible signals of enhanced performance.",
        "This two pronged line of inquiry led him to engage projects as both autonomous objects and immersive environments, to celebrate them as often for carefully assembled construction details as for masterfully choreographed atmospheric effects, and to write from the contrasting vantage points of the attentive connoisseur and distracted flaneur.",
        "Although many of the writings examined in this study saw Banham leaning heavily to one or the other extreme (or shifting abruptly from one to the other), his late writings on High Tech demonstrate an attempt to accommodate these contrasting ambitions under the rubric of what he called \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d With this \u201cdeceptively simple phrase,\u201d which, he admitted, \u201csome may find...rather old fashioned,\u201d40 Banham attempted to capture the elusive qualities that defined not just High Tech but also the fundamental essence of architecture itself.",

        "This staunch commitment to core modernist values leads Banham explicitly to champion the continued relevance of the machine aesthetic as the ultimate source of High Tech\u2019s visual qualities.",
        "For Banham, the machine aesthetic implied a particular form of part to whole coherence, leading him to a keen attentiveness to construction details.",
        "This commitment to rational and legible building assemblies prompted repeated reflections on the canon of modern architecture, the clear genealogy of works extending back through innovative structures of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and projecting forward through High Tech into the immediate future.",
        "Taken together, these themes comprise the fundamental components of Banham\u2019s attempts to make sense of the varied output of High Tech architects and to articulate the task of \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d A 1982 treatment of Richard Rogers\u2019s Inmos Microprocessor Factory (Newport, Wales, 1982) (figs.",
        "5.7, 5.8) demonstrates Banham\u2019s nuanced position regarding functionalism.41 At Inmos, significant mechanical provisions were required to accommodate the facility\u2019s \u201cclean room\u201d for microchip assembly, resulting in an extensible, axial scheme with an array of air handling equipment prominently displayed on the building\u2019s roof.",
        "In this, Rogers turned the organization of Henman and Cooper\u2019s Royal Victoria Hospital (1903) (see figs.",
        "3.6, 3.7) on its head.",
        "Where in the older building an axial array of mechanical equipment was deployed invisibly beneath the building (as Team 4 would later do at Reliance Controls), at Inmos, Rogers placed the required equipment proudly in view.",
        "Yet, for Banham, the imagery at Inmos was less about legibly representing this equipment than about producing a palpable feeling of necessity that he likened to that of sailing ships: \u201cThe air of conviction that pervades almost every part of the design seems to derive, as in naval architecture, from a sense of necessity, a feeling that nothing could be other than it is.\u201d42 Banham also noticed this link between function and necessity in Piano + Rogers\u2019s B&B Italia Office Building (1971 73) in Novedrate, Italy, where he found \u201cnothing to be seen in, or on, this building beyond what is necessary as architecture.\u201d Importantly, this constituted \u201ca little more than what might be necessary as engineering, but the purely engineering solution would not be anywhere near as rich.",
        "The difference between those two conceptions of \u2018necessary\u2019 is what makes architecture of B&B.\u201d43 If architecture, as opposed to engineering practice, required an excess of necessity, so too did nautical works move beyond the strictly functional.",
        "Much of the necessity on display in sailing ships, Banham explained, was \u201crhetorical,\u201d even \u201csuperstitious.\u201d44 In the end, it was not the fact but rather the feeling of necessity that was crucial to the inherent rightness of both sailing ships and High Tech architecture.",
        "And while this accommodation of rhetorical elements certainly represented a softening of the ruthless logic Banham had praised in the New Brutal ism and elsewhere,45 it maintained his consistent requirement of \u201capprehensibility and coherence of the building as a visual entity.\u201d46 In addition, and notwithstanding his requirement that performance actually be delivered, it underlined Banham\u2019s insistence that the problem of functionalism was first and foremost aesthetic.",
        "Linked to Banham\u2019s advocacy of functionalism was his faith in the enduring relevance of the machine aesthetic.",
        "\u201cThe concept of the Machine Age,\u201d he intoned in a 1976 lecture, \u201cwon\u2019t go away.\u201d47 In an interview a decade later, he opined, I think the one continuing cultural significance is the desire to convince clients and passersby, visually, that this is a building that really works like a machine.",
        "The occasional passing quotation from the Crystal Palace, as for example at Lloyd\u2019s, is more a profession of faith in the tradition....",
        "When the Rogers office or the Foster office does an apparent quote from a 19th Century structure, it is a quite considered, deliberate statement that they belong to that grand old Rationalist tradition.48 That \u201cgrand old Rationalist tradition\u201d of glazed, iron framed construction had been outlined in canonical books by Nikolaus Pevsner and Sigfried Giedion.49 Banham was unconvinced by the links these authors drew between nineteenth century precedents and the canonical twentieth century projects.",
        "In his eyes, the \u201cInternational Style work of Giedion\u2019s friends Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, or Pevsner\u2019s hero, Gropius\u201d did not resonate visually with the \u201copen work, transparent\u201d frames of \u201cthe Grand Constructeurs\u201d of the nineteenth century such as Joseph Paxton and Gustave Eiffel.50 Here again, Banham nudged the label \u201cthe International Style\u201d away from Hitchcock and Johnson, this time not toward Alfred Barr but rather toward more proximate adversaries in the fight to define modern architecture, namely Pevsner and Giedion.",
        "And if these historians were unconvincing in their association of Corbusier, Mies, and Gropius with the \u201cRationalist tradition\u201d of the nineteenth century, Banham felt he was on surer footing, offering Foster, Piano, and Rogers as rightful heirs to that tradition.",
        "These younger architects\u2019 tendency to use open frames and exposed fasteners and to foreground the starkly mechanical over the Platonically abstract aligned them with \u201cthat \u2018Other\u2019 modernist tradition \u2014that of Constructivism, Futurism, etc.\u201d to which Banham had devoted so much attention throughout his career.5' Importantly, if High Tech rejected the refined abstractions of the International Style, it also seemed to move away from the jarring radicalism Banham had earlier sought under the banner of une architecture autre.",
        "For if, as he surmised in 1966, une architecture autre was \u201csomething the traditions of architecture could not absorb,\u201d52 then High Tech, the true inheritor of the \"other\u201d tradition, displayed \u201ca desire for clarity and frugality in resolving functional problems within the canons of architecture.\u201d53 In his late writings, Banham repeatedly forged deliberate links between the work of the 1970s and \u201980s and the tradition of technological innovation dating to the nineteenth century.",
        "In his final years, one finds interspersed with these arguments broader speculation on the links between architecture and technology in general.",
        "High Tech was presented as the inheritor not just of the grand traditions of Victorian engineering and the machine aesthetic but also of a technological legacy stretching back to antiquity.",
        "This attitude pervades the seminar on High Tech he led at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) in 1987.",
        "He devoted three of the term\u2019s ten weeks to High Tech\u2019s historical pedigree, spending one week each on \u201cTechnology and Architecture,\u201d \u201cHistory and Symbolism,\u201d and the \"Ancestors of High Tech.\u201d54 Though these lectures unfortunately were not recorded, lecture notes taken by student Janey Bennett offer a sense of the material Banham covered.55 In the course, Banham linked all architecture closely with technology, though his typical partisanship was clearly on display.",
        "Bennett recorded in her notes an early contrast of the Doric order (a \u201cconservative technology\u201d) with the technical daring of the Gothic period (\u201cnot conservative\u201d).",
        "Where Greek architects were mocked for their ornamental tendencies (\u201cI know it fell down but the fluting on the columns was beautiful\u201d56), the Gothic period won praise for bolder innovation (marked, ironically, by a high rate of structural failure) and for a culture in which \u201ctechnicians were admired most.\u201d57 A similar partitioning can be seen in Banham\u2019s discussion of the Crystal Palace (\u201cconservative\u201d58) and the Brooklyn Bridge (\u201ccutting edge stuff\u201d59).",
        "A text Banham often cited, Paul Valery\u2019s Eupalinos, ou I\u2019architecte (1921), also found its place in the seminar.60 Banham had referenced Valery\u2019s contrast of the architect Eupalinos and the shipwright Tridon years earlier in The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment: \u201cThe former was preoccupied with the right method for doing the allotted tasks, and deploying the accepted methods, of his calling, and seemed to find a philosophical problem in every practical decision.",
        "Tridon, on the other hand, applied the technology that came conveniently to hand, whether or not it was part of the shipbuilding tradition, and treated the sayings of philosophers as further instruction of the direct solution of practical problems.\u201d61 At UCSC, Ban ham\u2019s praise of Tridon\u2019s boffinesque pragmatism and distaste for Eupalinos\u2019s intellectual proclivities was far blunter.",
        "\u201cOne loaded gun beats 4 aces,\u201d reads Bennett\u2019s notes, followed by \u201cdesign defeats itself by being too good.\u201d62 With these and other examples, Banham rehearsed some of his most well known argumentation: praising aggressive technical innovation, damning overt theoretical speculation, and defining architecture as a field fundamentally linked to technology yet perennially hamstrung by both methodological convention and delusions of intellectual grandeur.",
        "Though Banham directed significant attention to the visual qualities of High Tech buildings and their sources in the modern architecture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, he ultimately saw modernism as far more than a style.",
        "Rather, the concept represented an underlying ethos of rationality that held firm beneath visually diverse and chronologically distant buildings and continued to exert a vital influence on contemporary culture.",
        "Modernism, he argued, \u201cmade sense to the kind of practical minded men who managed the building programs of major corporate and government clients.\u201d63 Of course, making sense to such \u201cpractical minded men\u201d might mean little more than reinforcing their agendas, and thus close associations with corporate and government culture could as easily represent modernism's \u201ctriumph\u201d as its \u201ctragedy.\u201d The latter, he found, was the case of the MACE system for school construction,64 which \u201ccould not protect its original social idealism and aesthetic vision against the erosions and corrosions of three decades of cost cutting and vote chasing.\u201d The results were no \u201cmere stylistic crisis,\u201d as many critics took them to be, but rather \u201ca complicated civic and professional disaster.\u201d Where postmodern critics stepped in to articulate the faults of misfires such as MACE in stylistic terms (and also to offer alternatives in stylistic terms), Banham noticed that \u201cManfredo Tafuri, almost alone, with his concept of the inability of architecture as a profession to deliver the \u2018Utopia of Social Democracy\u2019 to which the Modern Movement had been committed, seems to have understood the magnitude of the problem.\u201d Implying that he was also to be counted among those who saw the writing on the wall, Banham continued, but one may beg leave to dif fer from his diagnosis: the problem may have been less to do with social ideology than with the business of actually putting buildings together.",
        "Banham would routinely sidestep ideological questions by pivoting to construction details, and doing so left him open to criticism that he was unconcerned with the ideological implications of architecture\u2019s technological servicing and icono graphic symbolization of the status quo.",
        "Referring to Banham as a paladin of technological orthodoxy,\u201d Tafuri suggested as much in otherwise respectful comments in i976.6S Indeed, for Banham, the central preoccupation of the resurgent modern architecture of High Tech was detailing\u2014not ideology, materials, or style \u2014and it was in their detailing that such works would demonstrate their efficacy and earn their status not only as modern but also as architecture.",
        "Consider his treatment of details at Rogers\u2019s Lloyd\u2019s of London building: Confront any single detail \u2014 the fixing of the uprights of the handrails of the external stairs, for instance \u2014 and one is looking at a design solution that would be virtually inconceivable in normal engineering practice.",
        "An engineer might, indeed, have done a handrail upright for half the price, but the result would not have been half as rewarding as a piece of architecture\u2014 Engineering is one way of designing things, architecture is another.",
        "The triumph of Lloyd s is, paradoxically, that it is so often difficult to tell them apart.66 Or consider his careful description of the connections at Renzo Piano\u2019s IBM Traveling Pavilion (1982 86; figs.",

        "This object is a work of architectural art in its own right, the complexity of its functions and connections is an architectural composition richer than many complete buildings, and the fanaticism that informs its conception suggests the kind of passion that Le Corbusier found in the modenature [sic] of Michelangelo.67 Examples of this deft combination of precise description, historical contextualiza tion, and exuberant celebration of construction details can be found throughout Banham\u2019s writing on the work of Foster, Piano, Rogers, and elsewhere.68 In these writings, as Nigel Whiteley noticed, Banham returned to many of the disciplinary values he first articulated in the context of the New Brutalism.69 Whiteley did not comment, however, on Banham\u2019s reversal of his attitude toward details.",
        "In 1955, Banham advocated the Smithsons\u2019 \u201cabstemious under designing\u201d of the details at Hunstanton.",
        "By the mid 1980s, he appeared fully to support \u201carty\u201d details such as those he had chastised at Louis Kahn\u2019s Yale University Art Gallery.70 And while Banham did endorse the minimal gasketed joints employed by Foster at the buildings for the IBM Pilot Head Office and Willis Faber & Dumas, in those writings one scarcely finds the glowing praise he lavished on Piano\u2019s complex connections.",
        "\u201cHigh Tech,\u201d as Banham put it in the context of Rogers\u2019s work, \u201cas epitomized by the elaborate and painstaking detailing of Lloyd\u2019s, was clearly preoccupied with putting buildings together properly.\u201d71 Piano\u2019s work similarly was centered around the careful assembly of building components.",
        "And while Piano described his approach to architecture as \u201cdealing with a language,\u201d Banham maintained that \u201cthe linguistic analogy does not quite explain the complete situation.\u201d In projects such as the IBM Pavilion, \u201cthe pieces do not form a simple hierarchical assembly, in which one piece supports another piece which supports another, etc., but the ribs and plexiglass [s/c] pyramids work together to form a complex three dimensional truss, whose \u2018whole is greater than its parts.\u2019 The pieces are usually perceived by Piano himself, and by anyone who looks at the finished work, as organic parts of the building as a whole.\u201d72 Thus, Banham found in Piano\u2019s work an unapologetically classical form of part to whole coherence.",

        "In his late writings on High Tech, he emphatically rejected such tactics and instead championed traditional disciplinary values such as unity, permanence, and monumentality.",
        "In 1965, in the context of clip on, Banham had written, \u201cWhat was at stake in all these projects, concepts, and the rare completed buildings, was an architecture whose form was not defined by the accepted rules of architecture \u2014 symmetry, unity, coherence, balance, and all of those.\u201d74 Two decades later, he appeared to be betting heavily on at least three of those four qualities as the bases of a technological architecture \u201cappropriate to the times.\u201d75 The elegant assembly of architectural components into coherent unities Banham saw at the IBM Pavilion was at the core of \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d In later works, such as Piano\u2019s museum for the Menil Collection in Houston (1986) (figs.",

        "Freestanding light fixtures within the main office area were aimed vertically to reflect their light off the convex roof surface above similarly to provide indirect illumination throughout the facility.",

        "\u201cSurely,\u201d he argued, \u201cin the High Tech world of electronic communications and personal computers most of these people could stay home\u2014stay in bed, even\u2014and do their business without crowding on to this hopelessly overloaded site.\u201d That they do not, Banham surmised, was because \u201cbeing there is what it is all about....",

        "Architecture may have abandoned its utopian dreams of changing the world, because the world is perfectly capable of changing itself without architecture\u2019s aid, but the compulsion to try and make sense of the resulting human dilemma is still the most essential quality of Modernism.\u201d In Banham\u2019s estimation, High Tech architects\u2014when successful\u2014enacted Horatio Greenough\u2019s definition of beauty as \u201cthe promise of function made sensuously pleasing.\u201d80 And if the satisfaction of Greenough\u2019s proviso made High Tech buildings beautiful, for Banham, it was the solution of \u201cthe technical problems of creating fit environments for human activities\u201d within the accepted traditions of the discipline that made them architecture.81 The Paradoxes of High Tech In the concept of \u201cmaking architecture,\u201d Banham\u2019s argumentation came full circle.",
        "Where earlier writings had placed tradition and technology in opposition, in his writings on High Tech, the latter was ultimately brought in line with the former.",
        "But rather than resulting in syntheses, the various themes that have been traced through this chapter each elicited something of a paradox.",
        "Earlier invocations of functionalism and technology had led Banham to predict the dissipation of architecture into invisibly serviced milieus (such as the un house he had imagined in 196s).82 But in the context of High Tech, they led him to sanction the visual presentation of functional necessity and to endorse functionally unnecessary rhetorical elements to assure architecture\u2019s legibility.",
        "With such tactics, Banham, who had criticized orthodox modern architecture throughout much of his career, closely aligned High Tech projects such as Inmos with the coherent imagery of canonical works such as Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer\u2019s Fagus Factory (Alfeld an der Leine, Germany, 1911) Yet Banham continued to take issue with the International Style, which, as noted above, he associated not only with Hitchcock and Johnson but also closely with Alfred Barr, Sigfried Giedion, and Nikolaus Pevsner.",
        "While he would espouse that style\u2019s derivation of the visual character of contemporary works from nineteenth century precedents, he had little enthusiasm for the white walled aesthetic so revered by the modern movement\u2019s first historians.",
        "He did, however, maintain a firm commitment to the machine aesthetic, and he offered mechanistic projects such as Centre Pompidou and Renault as alternatives to the International Style that more closely adhered to that movement\u2019s stated ambitions to legibly exhibit functional performance.",
        "Reading High Tech\u2019s exuberant compositions against the restrained offerings of the International Style, one might have expected Banham to finally embrace the brash juxtapositions he had flirted with in \u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d and periodically throughout his career.",
        "But as has been shown in his repeated admonitions of ad hoc compositional techniques, High Tech inspired him to reject the expedient accretion of elements in favor of elegant, unified compositions reinforced by meticulously crafted construction details.",
        "In his careful explication of connective elements, Banham took on the role of attentive and learned connoisseur, engaging High Tech works as discrete aesthetic objects in the manner of his mentor, Nikolaus Pevsner.",
        "Yet, as in his treatment of James Stirling\u2019s Olivetti Training Center over a decade earlier,83 Banham\u2019s attention had a tendency to wander from the object of inquiry.",
        "The details at Lloyd\u2019s, recall, in the end collapsed into a cacophonous social milieu, while those at Menil vanished into a near spiritual atmosphere dedicated to the physical experience of art.",
        "In neither building was the contemplation of architectural details the ultimate goal, even if the specific character of the details that composed each space was crucial to the overall effect.",
        "Thus, while Banham himself remained a learned connoisseur, he ultimately found High Tech\u2019s most potent effects in the production of immersive spaces populated by distracted flaneurs.",
        "Perhaps strangest of all, Banham, who demonstrated a knack for capturing a movement\u2019s iconographic qualities in tidy tripartite phrases throughout his career, set out to organize a book on High Tech around a set of concepts he admitted were underequipped to fully characterize the movement.84 Banham\u2019s work on Making Architecture began as High Tech architects moved their work resolutely away from adherence to his triple definition of exposed structure, exposed services, and bold colors.",
        "Indeed, like Dewhurst Haslam\u2019s Porsche building, discussed in the previous chapter, significant late projects such as Menil and Lowara bore little resemblance to the criteria.85 Yet, as Foster, Piano, and Rogers distanced themselves from the visible iconography of High Tech as a style, they appeared more firmly to embrace the moral imperatives of modernism as a technique for \u201cmaking architecture.\u201d In the pursuit of clearly integrated building technologies, honest and appropriate visual expression, and a unified discipline that governed \u201cthe whole conception of the building,\u201d86 the task of making architecture adhered to a different triple set of criteria Banham outlined toward the end of his career\u2014mot structure, services, and color but rather clarity, honesty, and unity.87 Barr\u2019s Aesthetic Modernism Pevsner\u2019s Stylistic Modernism Giedion\u2019s Tectonic Modernism Banham\u2019s Ethical Modernism planar Volumes Victorian Engineering Iron and Steel Clarity Regular Massing Arts and Crafts Reinforced Concrete Honesty Blank Surfaces Art Nouveau Glass Unity These, Banham pointed out, were central \u201cdogmas\u201d of \u201cthe modernist establishment in Europe\u201d in the interwar years just as they were primary motivating principles for the Eameses, the Smithsons, and other major adherents to modernist doctrine of the immediate postwar period.88 With them in hand, we can differentiate Banham\u2019s position on modern architecture from that of the more orthodox predecessors he had studied at the outset of his career (table 2).",
        "The triple formula of planar volumes, regular massing, and blank surfaces Alfred Barr invoked in The International Style outlined a version of modern architecture understood primarily in terms of aesthetics, a vision that bore out in Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s explication of the approach in the same book.",
        "Pevsner, in Pioneers of the Modem Movement (1936), defined modern architecture primarily in terms of period styles, seeing it as the inheritor of three traditions: Victorian engineering, the arts and crafts movement, and art nouveau.",
        "Giedion, by contrast, laid out a fundamentally tectonic modern architecture in Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisen beton (1928), in which he posited the use of iron and steel, reinforced concrete, and (though he did not include it in his title) glass as central characteristics.",
        "Though Banham would grapple with the aesthetic, tectonic, and stylistic implications of modern architecture throughout his career, ultimately, his position came down to the ethical imperatives of clarity, honesty, and unity.",
        "These values also featured strongly in the writings of nineteenth century thinkers such as Augustus Pugin, John Ruskin, Gottfried Semper, and Eugene Emmanuel Viollet le Duc; and they colored classical conceptions of architecture dating to antiquity.89 Indeed, more traditional values in architecture scarcely could be found.",
        "Though Banham considered abandoning many of architecture\u2019s traditional values in his writings,90 his commitment to clarity, honesty, and unity\u2014tenets meant to outline architecture\u2019s ethics as well as to govern its aesthetics \u2014 never wavered.",
        "These qualities capture the essence of the modern architecture Banham saw in High Tech and advocated throughout his career, and their centrality to his notion of \u201cmaking architecture\u201d makes clear that for Banham, technique was the primary determinant of style.",

In it, Banham saluted his predecessor at NYU, Henry Russell Hitchcock, primarily through an analysis of The International Style, the famous 1932 book Hitchcock coauthored with Philip Johnson.",
        "Hitchcock, he argued, \u201cviewed buildings as \u2018discrete aesthetic objects,\u2019 and tended to avoid theory and ideology.\u201d2 While this attitude brought serious drawbacks to the book (particularly an occlusion of the political and social implications of modern architecture), its authors\u2019 unashamed concentration on matters of style was, for Banham, a laudable achievement.",
        "Banham also was impressed by Alfred Barr\u2019s provision in the preface to the book of a tidy three part formula \u201cdistinguishing [the] aesthetic principles of the International Style\u201d as planar volumes, regular massing, and blank surfaces.3 \u201cThe propositions,\u201d he claimed, \u201ccurl back on one another until in the end we realize that we are confronted with a kind of minimal \u2014but definitive, integrated, and irreducible description of building in the modern style.\u201d4 In concentrating on the discernible qualities of objects themselves, Banham surmised, Barr\u2019s formulations\u2014as well as Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s book as a whole \u2014 offered a rigorous portrait of modern architecture relatively free of the ideological mystifications that had colored so many other accounts of the movement.",

        "The International Style, in both Barr\u2019s formulation and Hitchcock and Johnson\u2019s \u201crigorous description,\u201d6 offered visual, organizational, and material criteria as a test of stylistic orthodoxy.",
        "Banham, by contrast, looked to the immanence not of formal properties but rather of \u201cprocedures\u201d and \u201cambitions\u201d in modern architecture.",

        "A Black Box This valorization of technique over style was implicit in Banham\u2019s early championing of ethics over aesthetics in The New Brutalism, just as it had been in his move away from structure, services, and color toward clarity, honesty, and unity in the context of High Tech.",
        "Though meticulously attentive to the formal and organizational characteristics of the building designs he examined, Banham ultimately was less concerned with categorizing aesthetic objects than with understanding (and, often, influencing) the thinking subjects that occupied and executed them.",
        "With his final essay, \u201cA Black Box: The Secret Profession of Architecture,\u201d he offered a case in point.8 In this poignant text, written during the terminal phase of his illness and characterized by Peter Hall as his \u201cswan song,\u201d9 Banham reinforced his belief that architecture ultimately was determined not by objects but rather by actions.",
        "The text opens with the polemical claim that \u201c[Nicholas] Hawksmoor was an architect and [Christopher] Wren was not,\u201d with the distinction between the two coming down to a difference between \u201cfundamental modes of designing.\u201d10 Banham was at pains to determine the characteristics of the architectural mode, but lacking a clear definition, he proceeded negatively through a series of sharp witted anecdotes to draw increasingly close boundaries around the field.",
        "If Wren\u2019s output was not to be mistaken for architecture, neither should the works of \u201cprogrammatic postmodernism.\u201d He took a caustic parting shot at that idiom: \u201cReliance on erudition alone leaves postmodernism in the same relation to architecture as female impersonation to femininity.",
        "It is not architecture, but building in drag.\u201d11 Banham\u2019s distinction between architects and engineers was similarly exclusive, if decidedly less derisive toward the outsiders.",
        "He characterized engineers as \u201cproblem solvers,\u201d while architects appeared to subscribe to \u201csome secret value system\u201d that had little to do with the solution of environmental or constructional challenges.12 Indeed, he warned that architecture should not be seen as \u201csynonymous with \u2018good design\u2019\u201d or even with the design of buildings.13 This series of exclusions led Banham to his central thesis: \u201cWhat distinguishes architecture is not what is done \u2014since on their good days, all the world and his wife can apparently do it better\u2014but how it is done.\u201d14 Attempting to glean something of the field\u2019s working method, Banham then turned to Christopher Alexander\u2019s notion of a \u201cpattern language.\u201d15 These patterns, Banham explained, contained \u201cknowledge of the form and how to make it.\u201d16 In addition, he continued, these patterns \u201cwill have moral force, will be the only right way of doing that particular piece of designing \u2014at least in the eyes of those who have been correctly socialized into the profession.\u201d For Banham, \u201csuch patterns \u2014perhaps even a finite set of patterns\u2014and their imperatives seem to be shared by all architects, and are, in some sense, what we recognize in Hawksmoor but do not find in Wren.\u201d In this, Banham was rehearsing arguments he had made twenty two years earlier in The New Brutalism.",
        "In the conclusion of that book, he ruminated on the tightly circumscribed and ultimately traditional boundaries of the discipline and the consolidation of \u201cmoral force\u201d into a professional ethics by its adherents.",
        "The ethic of Brutalism was a campaign of \u201cmens sana in corpore sano,\u201d but no one should have doubted that the mind and the body would prove, ultimately, to be the mind and body which had always belonged to architecture....",
        "I make no pretense that I was not seduced by the aesthetic of Brutalism, but the lingering tradition of its ethical stand, the persistence of an ideal that the relationships of the parts and materials of a building are a working morality \u2014this, for me, is the continuing validity of the New Brutalism.17 Thus, Banham linked architecture\u2019s ethics to its aesthetics through a specific form of coherence between a building\u2019s formal composition, its material instantiation, and an underlying sense of morality.",
        "This link had been forged and remained intact, he surmised, through the persistence of a specific disciplinary technique, drawing, which Banham saw as \u201ca kind of meta pattern that subsumes all other patterns and shelters them from rational scrutiny.\u201d18 Produced through drawing, architecture\u2019s patterns emerged as images, just as New Brutalist buildings had been seen to do in 1955.",
        "The persistence of drawing in architecture appeared to Banham ultimately to signify an adherence to \u201ca set of rules of thumb derived from, and entirely proper to, the building arts of the Mediterranean basin alone, and whose master discipline, design, is simply disegno, a style of draughtsmanship once practiced only in central Italy.",
        "Reinforcing the field\u2019s classical roots, Banham hazarded a final three part categorization, this time aiming to encompass the totality of architectural produc tion: architecture is from masonry, held together by gravity, and its volumes effec tively closed.\u201d20 To a certain kind of old timer,\u201d Banham continued, \u2018\u2018this could be good news, confirmation that they were right all along and that we should have stuck to the orders and the theory of composition and ignored all that technology and mod ern stuff.\u201d21 Indeed, in Banham\u2019s final, restrictive definition, the more technological exponents of both historical and contemporary building practice were threatened with exclusion from the disciplinary ken: I am increasingly doubtful that the timber buildings of northern Europe, for instance, or the triumphs of Gothic construction, really belong under the rubric of architecture at all.",
        "Le Corbusier felt that Gothic cathedrals were \u201cnot very beautiful,\u201d not architecture even, because they were not made of the pure geometrical forms that he found in the buildings of classical Greece and imperial Rome.",
        "Current misgivings about high tech, with its exposed structures and services, seem to derive from a similar classicist sentiment.22 What is one to make of Banham\u2019s final deathbed testament? Anthony Vidler has argued that the text represents \u201can admission of defeat in changing \u2018architecture at all during his polemical career, and an expression of respect for such a tenacious tradition.\u201d23 In postulating an architectural object as the projection of a compressive, closed, masonry work by means of a specific drawing technique and an architectural subject as one properly socialized according to an \u201carcane and privileged aesthetic code,\u201d24 Banham\u2019s final definitions are strict and traditional, and they bear scant evidence of the field having been affected by his famous overtures to innovation and technology.",
        "The exchange of une architecture autre for an \u201cother\u201d tradition within modern architecture he performed in his late work on High Tech only reinforces Vidler\u2019s assessment, as do the melancholy conclusions of Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, The New Brutalism, The Architecture of the Well Tempered Environment, and Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past, each of which finishes with a recounting of the triumph of tradition and convention over technology and innovation.",
        "Nonetheless, glimmers of Banham\u2019s radicalism shine through \u201cA Black Box.\u201d Architecture, while perhaps a tenacious tradition, remained in the essay under threat from both the emergence of computer aided drawing techniques and impending anthropological scrutiny.",
        "In addition, Banham\u2019s suggested excision of so much material from architecture\u2019s \u201cintellectual portfolio\u201d\u2014not just northern vernaculars, Gothic cathedrals, and High Tech but also the \u201cZulu kraals, grain elevators, hogans, lunar excursion modules, cruck houses, Farman biplanes and so forth\u201d that had been \u201cco opted\u201d into the architectural canon during the twentieth century25\u2014certainly signaled an act of aggression against proponents of the field\u2019s hegemony over the totality of the building arts.",
        "By drawing disciplinary boundaries as tightly as he did \u2014 tightly enough to liberate the design of buildings from the purview of architecture\u2014Banham appears not so much to have capitulated to a \u201ctenacious tradition\u201d as to have offered a way out from under the \u201ccrippling limitation\u201d adherence to the field\u2019s \u201cparochial rule book\u201d had imposed upon \u201cbuilding\u2019s power to serve humanity.\u201d26 This too was a consistent refrain throughout his writing.",
        "In Theory and Design, Banham famously suggested that an architect hoping to keep up with technology might have to \u201cdiscard his whole cultural load, including the professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect.\u201d27 In the closing paragraphs of The New Brutalism, he opined that \u201carchitects who genuinely see how narrow and restricting are the traditions of their profession, normally get out of it, and become industrial designers, real eastate [sic] agents, systems engineers and any other discipline that enables them to tangle with the \u2018realities of the situation,\u2019 in a less inhibited manner.\u201d28 Relieving building from responsibilities to architecture and architecture from responsibilities to building, Banham attempted to free the one to better serve the needs of \u201ca world increasingly desperate for better buildings\u201d while allowing the other to \u201cbe recognized as something that belongs as valuably at the heart of western culture as do the Latin language, Christian liturgy, Magna Carta, or\u2014precisely\u2014the Masonic mysteries of Die Zauberflote.\u201d29 Ban ham\u2019s final writings thus echo his persistent call for two alternative trajectories for the field.",
        "The first enacted an unapologetic embrace of architecture\u2019s \u201coperational lore,\u201d while the second offered a liberated approach to building committed not to disciplinary tradition but rather to the application of \u201capparent intelligence\u201d to the design and construction of \u201cfit environments for human activities.\u201d30 Radical Convention: Archigram Banham made these themes a central concern of his last completed book, The Visions of Ron Herron, written in 1987 88 and published posthumously in 1994.",
        "In it, Banham drew significant attention to the work of this influential member of the Archigram group and, importantly, to the specific disciplinary techniques \u2014 drawing foremost among them\u2014through which Herron produced his work.",
        "Projects by Herron and other Archigram members figured strongly in Banham\u2019s writing from the mid 1960s to the end of his career.",
        "\u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d (1965) foregrounded themes that would become central to Banham\u2019s writings on High Tech in the 1970s and \u201980s.",
        "Later treatments in Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past (1976) and in his 1994 monograph drew these tensions into sharp relief.",
        "Both books are examined below, but before turning to them, a brief review of the group\u2019s activities and Banham\u2019s earlier treatments of them is in order.",
        "As in Banham\u2019s writing, one finds in Archigram a distinct tension between celebrating and lamenting architecture\u2019s dissipation in the face of alternative technological possibilities.",
        "And while Archigram\u2019s trajectory suggested an eventual triumph of invisibility over the image, the legacy and impact of the group, as well as the material fact of their output, suggests a different outcome.",
        "Many commentators have noticed that Archigram\u2019s seminal imagery of dissipated objects and distracted subjects offered a radical vision of a fundamentally altered architectural milieu.",
        "Few, however, have recognized that those very images, executed with a virtuosic command of the field\u2019s standard representational techniques, simultaneously advanced discrete objects and attentive subjects to reinforce, rather than to resist, conventional notions of architectural disciplinarity.",
        "Archigram burst onto the international scene in the mid 1960s.",
        "The series of radical projects, polemics, publications, and protests generated independently by and through various collaborations between Warren Chalk, Peter Cook, Dennis Crompton, David Greene, Ron Herron, and Mike \u201cSpider\u201d Webb has since been published widely and has received voluminous commentary.31 Whether praising or panning the group, most commentators have gravitated toward two key themes that resonate throughout the Archigram oeuvre: the emancipation of the leisure subject and the eradication of the architectural object.",
        "In 1999, Mike Webb offered a prototypical instance of the approach: Let us now enter the world depicted in one of these drawings: figures suggestive of young, healthy, and hard bodied men and women \u2014 mostly women I have to say \u2014 have been cut out of magazines and pasted on the surface.",
        "There is a bovine quality to them.",
        "They remind one somewhat of the Eloi in H.G.",
        "Wells\u2019 The Time Machine.",
        "They are all happy, healthy, and have health insurance bestowed upon them by a beneficent Labour government although they are beginning to look\u2014how shall I put it \u2014 a bit faded, even jaundiced, over the last few years.",
        "They probably work no more than a three day week and are undoubtedly \u201cwith it\u201d; a quaint phrase from the sixties that when used today shows the speaker to be anything but.",
        "To provide \u201ca backdrop for the activities for [their] bovine friends,\u201d Archigram would pilfer architectural elements from leading figures of the day (Webb cited Buckminster Fuller and Konrad Wachsmann as dependable sources), combine them with their own graphic and verbal musings, and assemble the fragments to \u201cshow how things would look if only planners, governments, and architects were magically able to discard the mental impedimenta of the previous age and embrace the newly developed technologies and their attendant attitudes.\u201d32 Unencumbered by the shackles of convention and the habits of experience, these young architects advanced all manner of technological gadgetry to solve problems previously addressed with buildings.",
        "Suitaloon (1967), a wearable membrane designed by Webb, offered a sartorial alternative to traditional brick and mortar construction; Info Gonks (1968), Peter Cook\u2019s premonition of today\u2019s augmented reality glasses, dazzled the eye with supercharged spectacles; and LogPlug and RokPlug (both 1969), by David Greene, smuggled electronic convenience into the great outdoors.",
        "Theirs was \u201ca world free of heavy and ponderous buildings that \u2018just get in the way,\u201d\u2019 a world in which \u201carchitecture gets smaller and smaller.\u201d As Webb pointed out, Greene even proposed a \u201cmoratorium on all new building\u201d in 1969.33 In seemingly countless drawings and proposals,34 the Archigram group celebrated swinging youth culture and advocated the dissolution of buildings.",
        "Yet the group started out with very different ambitions.",
        "The first two issues of their eponymous magazine focused on monumental buildings (mostly student projects) by London\u2019s younger generation.",
        "The premier broadsheet emphatically demanded (twice in two pages) that a \u201cnew generation of architecture must arise.\u201d35 Infatuated with the burgeoning space age, the group expressed (with a deliberate nod to Alison and Peter Smithson) a desire \u201cto drag into building some of the poetry of countdown, orbital helmets.\u201d36 Monumental building proposals remained the focus through issue 2, but with the third issue, the group\u2019s interests began to move beyond architectural form toward themes of expendability and global communication, among others 37 By issue 7, Peter Cook famously would proclaim, \u201cThere may be no buildings at all in Archigram 8 \u201d38 And while building proposals would continue to appear in later issues of the pamphlet, their right to be the sole recipient of an architect\u2019s attention and advocacy was challenged (often with tongue firmly in cheek) by increasingly ephemeral events (such as the various Instant City proposals by Cook and Herron, 1968 71) and distributed networks (such as Crompton\u2019s Computor City, 1964) better suited to accommodate and entertain the stylish representatives of youth culture that populated the group\u2019s imagery from the mid 1960s forward.39 Thus, Archigram\u2019s (and Archigram\u2019s) trajectory arcs in a three part transformation from eagle eyed experts rallying a like minded audience in support of a specific vision of monumental architecture to increasingly snarky pundits postulating distracted \u201cbovines\u201d efficiently serviced by their technologically enhanced pastures.",
        "Banham\u2019s \u201cA Clip On Architecture\u201d40 is the earliest serious study of the Archi gram group and remains a seminal resource.",
        "In it, Banham built on the revisionist arguments of his influential Theory and Design in the First Machine Age to provide Archigram with a coherent genealogy of \u201canti formal,\u201d \u201cindeterminate,\u201d and \u201cendless\u201d precedents while using the group to take obvious if sotto voce potshots at the monumental figures and tendencies of orthodox modern architecture.41 Countering a dismissive treatment in Arena,42 Banham next offered \u201cZoom Wave Hits Architecture\u201d in 1966.43 Here, in a widely read national magazine, he praised independent magazines produced at English architecture schools such as Polygon (Regent Street Polytechnic), Megascope (Bristol University), and Clip Kit (Architectural Association), as well as Archigram, for advancing \u201cup to the minute\u201d proposals that countered the \u201cdreary solutions\u201d demanded by the aging faculties at those same institutions.44 Clip Kit drew special applause for its tidy encapsulation of the spirit of the contemporary scene, but, for Banham, \u201cthe reigning champion of protest mags\u201d45 and the standard bearer of the \u201cMovement\u201d was Archigram.",
        "While his tone remained panegyric throughout, Banham subtly nudged the young architects toward more aggressive experimentation.",
        "If you design right up to the minute, it will be many millions of minutes later before the human race can move in, and the buildings will be out of date by just that time period.",
        "Hence the constant preoccupation of the Movement with far out figures like Buckminster Fuller, Yona Friedman or (in Britain) Cedric Price, men who propose not only a more up to the minute environment, but wild technological methods for getting it built quicker and in quantities more nearly commensurate with human needs 46 For Banham, these concerns, combined with an \u201cinsistence on relevance\u201d to contemporary culture, provided the cornerstones of the little magazine project.",
        "Aimed at individual human needs rather than at idealistic general solutions, the ideology of the \u201cMovement\u201d offered a means to avoid the leaden profundities that undermined the efforts of more established theoreticians.",
        "As he put it, \u201cWe architectural pedagogues are prone to build architecture up into a higher discipline of abstractly ordering the masses about for their own good.\u201d Once again, Banham subtly jibed the humanist tradition and hinted at a means to project alternative subjectivities through architecture.",
        "Rather than advancing geometric harnesses that stretch Vit ruvian and Modulor Men alike into idealized configurations, Archigram and other young architects offered loose, flexible, and indeterminate environmental appurtenances that fostered \u201cthe other kind of humanism\u201d in contemporary culture.47 Banham went on to link these ambitions directly to visual imagery: \u201cAdmittedly, the level of relevance is often only that of form fondling, round corner styling, art work and paint jobs.",
        "It is more than that, but even if it were purely visual and superficial, that would not in itself be contemptible.",
        "It does still matter to people what buildings look like.",
        "Indeed it matters more than it did.\u201d48 These passages reveal once more a contradictory tension in Banham\u2019s thinking.",
        "On one hand, buildings (or at least \u201cenvironments\u201d) needed to adopt \u201cup to the minute\u201d technology to address as fully as possible contemporary human needs.",
        "On the other hand, a deep engagement in the \u201cpurely visual and superficial\u201d had to be maintained to guarantee relevance to contemporary culture.",
        "A balance, then, apparently was required to avoid the tendency of such new works of \u201cgoing invisible on us,\u201d of \u201cform following] function into oblivion.\u201d49 For Banham, Archigram's balance of expressive imagery and expedient accommodation offered a provocative model for the discipline.",
        "Megastructure: Urban Futures of the Recent Past This tension between visual coherence and functional performance also colors Banham\u2019s 1976 book on the megastructure movement.",
        "Beyond providing an informative treatment of a body of work that had significant influence on the development of High Tech architecture, Banham provided an extended discussion on the Archigram group in which he gathered important precedents for their activities, traced the history and impact of the Archigram pamphlets, and outlined the group\u2019s imbrications in the short lived megastructure movement.",
        "Banham also provided an important account of Constant Nieuwenhuys\u2019s evolving project for New Babylon in which Banham closely aligned Homo Ludens, Johan Huizinga\u2019s ideal ludic subject, with the activities of the Situationist International, of which Constant was a member.50 Constant\u2019s proposal illustrated an environment he saw as more conducive to the emergent possibilities the situationists sought through their famous derives and thus more appropriate for the ludic subjects who incited them.",
        "New Babylon, he argued, was \u201cthe environment the homo ludens is supposed to live in.\u201d51 Constant\u2019s situationist compatriots were not convinced, and Banham\u2019s explanation of their opposition to Constant\u2019s architectural proposals echoes nearly to the letter criticisms that later would be leveled at Archigram: \u201c[Constant\u2019s] building of actual models only served to excuse the techniciens de la forme architectural, while the attempt to propose actual mechanisms for la vie ludique merely played into the hands of a consumer economy.\u201d52 In a later chapter, \u201cFun and Flexibility,\u201d Banham developed arguments he first made in \u201cA Clip On Architecture.\u201d He addressed the question of the ludic subject in Price\u2019s and Archigram\u2019s work, ultimately distancing the English architects from the strict ideological positions of their situationist counterparts on the Continent, and he highlighted the English contribution to the megastructure movement as the introduction of issues specific to building construction, a move that resulted in a subtle and important conflation of drawing and detailing.",
        "Repeating a device he would deploy throughout his career, Banham began by shifting the focus from theory to practice: \u201cLooking back over the first half of the sixties and the characteristic megastructures of the period, it is noticeable \u2014 alarming even \u2014 how few of them offer any nut and bolt proposals as to how the transient elements should be secured to the megaform, or what precise devices and services are required for the playful activities of Homo ludens\u201d Price\u2019s Fun Palace (see pi.",
        "2), by contrast, had been worked out sufficiently to satisfy English building and planning regulations, while Archigram \u201cseemed to be motivated by sheer manic pleasure in proliferating drawings.\" Yet both practices seemed somehow devoid of a specific ideological position.",
        "As Banham explained, \u201cThe absence of any explicit ideology was found disturbing, or at least baffling, outside Britain; on the other hand, the presence of detailing was almost universally welcomed, especially in the stunning graphic forms in which Archigram would present it.\u201d53 Banham again left the ideological question hanging and returned to the question of the ludic subject, noting that the Fun Palace was unlikely to offer fully self directed pleasure and thus would not have lived up to Constant\u2019s or the situationists\u2019 radical ambitions.",
        "The scale and complexity of the projects components would have necessitated the participation of an expert staff of operators to coordinate the varied activities pursued by the Palace\u2019s occupants and to manipulate the complex array of cranes and equipment that supported the work s indeterminate activities.",
        "\u201cThe whole proposition,\u201d he argued, \u201cwould probably have been unacceptable to Constant, and anathema to the hard line Situation 'sts but not unacceptable to someone raised in the tradition of the theatre, nor to English progressive professionals of the Left; neither group would see anything wrong with a little professional backstage assistance to the people\u2019s participatory pleasure out front.\u201d54 Banham noted Buckminster Fuller\u2019s similar willingness to allow individual participation to be mediated by an \u201cexpert staff\u201d in his contemporaneous World Game project before offering his own synopsis of the political situation: \u201cThe Fun Palace team, pragmatists to a man, were not minded to wait for the Revolution to make a perfect palais ludique possible; they would have a practicable Fun Palace here and now, as a way of raising public consciousness to the level where a Revolution might be found to have happened.\u201d55 Like Price\u2019s Fun Palace, Peter Cook\u2019s Plug In City (see pi.",
        "3) undoubtedly would have required a team of trained experts to manage and operate the cranes, trains, and other infrastructural appurtenances that accommodated its inhabitants\u2019 ludic wishes.",
        "Indeed, these limitations were noticed by the Archigram members, and throughout the late 1960s, the group began to distance themselves from the megastructure movement.",
        "The move was crystallized in a cut out megastructure model kit included in Archigram 7.",
        "For Banham, the kit was presented unequivocally as \u201ca joke, a self satire, on the grounds that \u2018everyone can do megastructures now, make your own.\u2019\u201d The message was clear: \u201cmegastructure was now a bore.\u201d56 Moving forward, Archigram turned their attention away from monumental construction toward diminutively scaled individual living units and personal gadgets.",
        "In these later works, the immediate satisfaction of \u201cindividual wishes\u201d reigned supreme.",
        "Alongside this shift in attention from collective monumentality to individual stimulation\u2014that is, from problems of the image to the promise of increasing invisibility\u2014came a much more emphatic presentation of human figures in Archigram\u2019s drawings.",
        "It is only to works dating after about 1966 that Mike Webb\u2019s formulation that \u201cthese figures probably occupy about a quarter of the given surface area of any given page\u201d can be applied accurately.57 As noted above, \u201cthese figures\u201d represented a specific sort of ludic subject.",
        "While Webb was to see them as distracted \u201cbovines\u201d in 1999, Banham in 1976 noticed significantly more energy: \u201cIt seemed to be nothing but dolly girls of every race and hue twisting or frugging in their modish miniskirts or striped mini dresses, exclaiming their delight at visiphone messages, relaxing in capsules, while smiling families promenaded the deck spaces, children danced ring a roses, crowds surged before giant images of pop stars on vast eidophore screens; everywhere were sunglasses, freaky hair, wild clothes.\u201d58 Banham went on finally to address Archigram\u2019s deliberate postulation of a ludic subject head on.",
        "In a move aiming to insulate Archigram from any specific ideology, he wrote, \u201cI must lay down a firm caveat against making too much of this fun imagery....The presence of all these leisure people in Archigram\u2019s permissive cities is as much an empirical solution to the problem of finding someone\u2014anyone!\u2014to populate them as it is a theoretical proposal for who should populate them.\u201d59 Few would agree with Banham\u2019s assessment, as he himself noted.60 Nigel Whiteley put it bluntly: \u201cThis...",
        "is Banham at his least convincing....",
        "The incorporation of a specific type of person did indicate the particular type of environment Archigram wished to create: Archigram were designing a Pop environment for the urban young.\u201d To underline his point, Whiteley appended a quotation from Warren Chalk: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live in Plug In City....",
        "Retired people probably won\u2019t.\u201d61 These passages mark another strange maneuver in Banham\u2019s argumentation.",
        "Two years before Megastructure, Banham had turned against attentive appreciation of James Stirling\u2019s clip on visual imagery at the Olivetti Training Center to champion instead a form of distracted subjectivity.62 In the closing paragraphs of \u201cProblem * 3 = Olivetti,\u201d Banham described a disinterested flaneur gliding across Stirling\u2019s ramps blissfully inattentive to the architectural composition and details that surround her (see pi.",
        "8).63 Throughout their later work, Archigram advanced exactly such a subject.",
        "Whether \u201ctwisting,\u201d \u201cfrugging,\u201d or just relaxing in \u201cbovine\u201d contentment, the inhabitants of Archigram\u2019s technological environments appear to perform in a manner exactly aligned with Banham\u2019s own vision of an ideal ludic subject, they pay scant attention to the increasingly ephemeral architectures that surround them as they move happily about their business.",
        "Indeed, by Archigram 9, architectural con struction had dissipated almost completely into the natural landscape or dreamlike virtuality, and the inhabitants of these new spaces were encouraged to pursue new forms of architectural stimulation beyond their material confines.",
        "Yet, though Archigram\u2019s late projects and pamphlets leave little doubt about their reconfigured views of architecture and the new forms of subjectivity they might engender, Ban ham distanced the group from their own rhetoric.",
        "At Olivetti, Stirling crafted carefully composed forms and materials to produce an architecture of visual effects steeped in mannerist references and subversions.",
        "His was an architecture aimed at attentive and knowing connoisseurs of archi tectural form every bit as intentionally as the Smithsons\u2019 Hunstanton School had been (see pi.",
        "i).64 Banham responded with annoyance and argued instead that the strongest effects at Olivetti were felt when the visitor\u2019s attention to detail lapsed into immersive experience.",
        "Strangely, when Archigram s projects much more emphatically encouraged just such a distracted mode of engagement, Banham drew attention not just to the group\u2019s images but specifically toward their concept of \u201cjointing.\u201d65 Where Stirling\u2019s actual details had been a source of irritation, Archigram\u2019s images of them were a potent source of architectural interest.",
        "Further praising the group for qualities he had disdained in Stirling\u2019s work, Banham went on to align Archigram with a disciplinary tendency to quote and comment.",
        "Certain projects, Banham pointed out, were \u201carabesqued with in group jokes about Cedric Price and Buckminster Fuller.\u201d66 Where Archigram\u2019s critics from the mainstream seized the opportunity to cast them as radical reformers, Banham\u2019s comments undercut the radicalism of their propositions and aligned with the charges of traditionalism leveled at them \u2014and at Banham himself\u2014in the same year by Peter Eisenman.",
        "Foreclosing the possibility of an \u201cEnglish Revisionist Functionalist\u201d return to bygone modern tendencies, Eisenman argued that modernism in architecture had not yet even occurred.",
        "He wrote, \u201cDeriving from a non humanistic attitude toward the relationship of an individual to his physical environment, it [modernism] breaks with the historical past, both with the ways of viewing man as a subject and...",
        "with the ethical positivism of form and function.",
        "Thus, it cannot be related to functionalism.",
        "It is probably for this reason that modernism up to now has not been elaborated in architecture.\u201d67 While modernism had been successfully adopted in painting, literature, and music, it had not developed in architecture because the discipline had yet to engage the \u201cnon objective,\u201d \u201cnon narrative,\u201d and \u201ca temporal\u201d qualities that signaled the movement's fundamental condition: \u201ca displacement of man away from the center of his world.\u201d68 To finally bring about architectural modernism, Eisenman argued for the abandonment of the form/function dialectic (and its outmoded humanism) in favor of a \u201cnew, modern dialectic\u201d of \u201ctransformation\u201d and \u201cdecomposition\u201d located \u201cwithin the evolution of form itself.\u201d69 Such radicalism, more appropriate to the postmodern discourse of the 1970s and \u201980s, was not to be found in the Archigram oeuvre.",
        "Peter Cook affirmed the group\u2019s interest in core disciplinary values in a 2008 interview: Q: A common opinion of Archigram is that the group was trying to dissolve architecture or break it down.",

        "Now, if you talk to somebody else, you might get a slightly different view of it.70 Mike Webb offered similar sentiments in 1999: \u201cAn architectural drawing is without doubt what its author, the young master, understood himself to be making....The drawing was never intended to be a window through which the world of tomorrow could be viewed but rather as a representation of a hypothetical physical envi \u201d71 ronment made manifest simultaneously with its two dimensional paper proxy.",
        "Banham, then, offered an accurate portrayal of the group\u2019s own ambitions and ideo logical stance.",
        "Archigram unequivocally directed their work at their peers within the field of architecture, an audience steeped in disciplinary convention and con ditioned to pay attention not just to a drawing's content but also to the technical processes involved in its production.",
        "While their images may have depicted leisure subjects in varying states of distracted contentment, in presenting meticulously crafted and pun laden artifacts specifically to architects, Archigram encouraged the deep attention and focus of knowledgeable connoisseurs, a move that ultimately reinforced rather than resisted conventional disciplinarity.",
        "Theirs was not a project of radical subversion but rather one of mischievous prodding, the work of preco cious masters deeply committed to their field but dismayed by a state of pervasive lassitude among their elders.",
        "Ultimately and unequivocally, Archigram saw their work as a continuation of the field\u2019s core activities \u2014 activities, it is often forgotten, that only sometimes play out on the construction site but always and more fundamentally unfold on the drafting table and, more recently, on the computer screen.",
        "Though they undoubtedly altered the cut and color with a stylish infusion of pop materials and methods, each member of Archigram was, throughout the 1960s and the ensuing decades, proudly clad in \u201cthe professional garments by which he is identified as an architect.\u201d72 The Visions of Ron Herron Banham reinforced this assessment of Archigram\u2019s commitment to conventional disciplinarity in The Visions of Ron Herron.",
        "As with \"A Black Box\u201d and \u201cActual Monuments,\u201d Banham completed the text during the final stages of his illness.",
        "Like the two late essays, this little examined text focuses on core disciplinary questions.",
        "In contrast to many commentators, who place work by Archigram members at the fringes of the field, Banham located Herron\u2019s output at its very center.",
        "According to Banham, Herron was engaged in a perennial task of the discipline: \u201cto transmute the stuff of technology into the matter of architecture.\u201d73 This engagement took place not so much through building, though Herron\u2019s practice had authored several impressive ones, but rather through architectural drawings, which Banham saw as bona fide works of architecture in their own right.",
        "Coupled with descriptions of key projects by the Herron office that undermine the stable architectural subjects and objects Banham had articulated in \"A Black Box,\u201d this attitude toward drawing suggested the possibility of works that, while produced through distinctly conventional methods, moved resolutely away from the traditionalism in evidence in his other late writings.",
        "Banham began by articulating the strange conventionality of Herron\u2019s supposedly iconoclastic work.",
        "[Herron\u2019s sketches] rarely seem to imply anything more than conventional current technologies of equipment and construction, bricolated together with off the shelf componentry\u2014though not always from the world of regular architecture.",
        "And that too should come as no great surprise, since Herron\u2019s whole output is somewhat at variance with the world of regular architecture.",
        "Paradoxically though, there can be no nonsense about him not being an architect.",
        "He is not a structural nor a systems engineer; in spite of his knowledge of both areas; he is not a computer whizz [sic], nor even a hacker, though few living architects are quite so computer friendly.",
        "He is in himself, and in his generation entirely at home in the world of current technology, yet always and entirely an architect.",
        "He knows exactly what he is after when he goes round invading the professional turfs of adjacent specializations (or even remote ones), but when he returns from these forays of design piracy he does not appear bent over and burdened down, as were the Machine Aesthetes of the 1920s, with the weight and importance of the loot he has acquired.",
        "He still occupies his usual professional posture.",
        "He never ceases to think and design like an architect, so that if his projects appear strange, they are no more than strange, rather than alien or threatening, to other architects, and the excitement he derives from these forays is communicable to other architects by purely architectural means \u2014or drawings, as they are more usually called.74 Banham was relentless in his alignment of Herron\u2019s working method with conventional disciplinary techniques.",
        "He continued: \u201cThe techniques of capture and domestication for architectural purposes, are entirely conventional, not to say traditional \u2014a Pentel R50 ballpen, Magic Markers, all that kind of familiar stuff.",
        "Only a little material is collaged in as found; the historical method of architectural recording\u2014disegno, dessin, tekening, zeichnung [sic], drawing\u2014is employed, and even his electronic outputs are computer graphics, right?\u201d75 These extended passages are set down here verbatim not just in submission to the stubborn resistance of Banham\u2019s prose to adequate paraphrase but also to demonstrate their author\u2019s emphatic explication of traditional disciplinary values and techniques at the base of Herron\u2019s output.",
        "In moving on to trace specific trends in the architect\u2019s approach, Banham further linked seemingly extradisciplinary tactics to venerated canonical precedents.",

        "To Banham, the situation was perplexing: \u201cHow can one explain, even to the Brits, that\u2014yes\u2014it is possible for a supposedly radical architect to accept at face value the \u2018Castles on the Ground\u2019 of bourgeois suburbia, and their presiding genius, the irretrievably bourgeois House of Windsor, with its polo ponies and corgis.\u201d78 To answer his own question, Banham pointed to a deconstructive ambition lurking at the heart of Herron\u2019s playful musings: \u201cOne valid (but never exclusive nor exhaustive) reading of his Suburban Sets is the undermining of suburbia from within and by its own implicit value system.\u201d True to his pragmatist leanings, Banham found the fulcrum of Herron\u2019s critique not in theoretical concepts but rather in practical tectonics: \u201cThe inner contradiction that will destroy suburbia as we know it has nothing to do with Marxist theory and a great deal to do with, e.g., picture windows.\u201d Where conventional wisdom has it that picture windows existed so that occupants may see out, Herron (and Banham) understood that their more important function was to allow others to see in, to reveal the individual subjects lurking behind the anonymous suburban facades.",
        "The situation was taken to an extreme in the Suburban Sets: \u201cAll those backyard secrets, all that illusionistic gismology, all those gazebos and grounded 747s, floodlit fountains and electronic tomatoes must, sooner or later, come bursting through the fapade into public view...and their flaunting will blow the cover off all the latter day Mr Pooters (who may include Mr Herron) who thought they could have your secret and eat it, so to speak.\u201d79 fig.",

        "Herron\u2019s unrealized project was designed to house a traveling exhibition for British Telecom.",
        "As in the Suburban Sets, Herron exploited a set of contradictory affiliations with varied building technologies.",
        "The Slug\u2019s structura system a cavernous PVC coated fabric inflatable lashed with steel cables with a grid of space frame towers\u2014wore its redundancy on its sleeve, with tensile sup ports visually (and only sometimes actually) pulling at a fabric structure that, du to internal air pressure, was already in tension.80 The visual contradiction in struc ture was compounded by the building\u2019s similarly expedient solution to the prob lem of demountable and transportable construction.",
        "The Slug was designed to s on a cast in place concrete slab \u2014 a new slab was to be poured at each installatio in preparation for the arrival on site of the rest of the Slug\u2019s components.",
        "Redun dant building elements and installation crews would leapfrog from site to site, eac iteration of the Slug would involve a different combination of new and reused e'e ments.",
        "Herron thus proposed an architecture that could not be defined fully W* reference to a specific location or a finite collection of material components.",
        "In this, one may notice a curious parallel with Peter Eisenman\u2019s elevation of \u2018'process concurrent writings: \u201cThe order or nature of the object now resides in that process which constitutes its differences...it is a nature now grounded in process, not in being; it is no longer based on the substance of the object...",
        "the object is no longer identical with its substance.\u201d81 But where Eisenman developed a new architectural ontology in the collapse of the formal aspects of an object into the conceptual pro cesses of design, Herron did so by conflating the material and temporal aspects of building construction.",
        "The Slug would have been articulated as much by specific material assemblies as by the designation of an event\u2014as with the fleet of aircraft that trade compo nents and the appellation \u201cAir Force One\u201d based on the presence of a specific occu pant, or the Grateful Dead\u2019s \u201cWall of Sound,\u201d a collection of redundant sound stage equipment that leapfrogged from venue to venue during the band\u2019s tours in the mid 1970s.",
        "Along a similar vein, while one Telecom Slug was up and running, other components would be in varying states of assembly, disassembly, reconfiguration, and transportation in anticipation of a future deployment.",
        "Banham described the complex ontology of such an object: At the level where one begins to visualize the logistics of managing and moving such an object as the Slug\u2014the size of a small cathedral, remember \u2014 systems thinking begins to have a curiously solvent effect on established architectural concepts like \u201ca building.\u201d The Slug may well have to be two Slugs, or two and some vulgar fraction Slugs, if it is to satisfy the programmed requirements of actually having one Slug on site for all of the times per annum that its operational calendar stipulates.82 Yet, in characteristic fashion, Banham quickly reinscribed the Slug\u2019s bold challenge to traditional understandings of architectural objects into the core workings of the field: \u201cWhether Ron Herron stops any longer to make distinctions between designing buildings, or near buildings, or kits that periodically add up to quasi buildings, or whatever; I very much doubt, but every so often he comes up with something like the Slug which seems light years away from what one commonly considers to be a building\u2014and, dammit! the thing is still architecture.\u201d83 Complicating the Slug\u2019s relation to core disciplinary values was the fact that Herron developed the work with the aid of computers, which placed the subversive object at odds with traditional drawing.",
        "Herron\u2019s use of computer aided design \u2014at the time a technology still in its infancy \u2014prompted Banham to offer a final commentary on \u201cDigital Design.\u201d This short section is a valuable rumination of the pressures applied by digital techniques to both architectural objects as well as the subjects that produce those objects.",
        "Tallying the advantages of computer aided techniques, Banham noted the now obvious fact that they allow architects to \u201cmonitor the effects of re design almost instantaneously, and can go on accumulating revision without sweating blood.",
        "More importantly, they can do it without generating labour intensive works of art that are too hard won to discard; the basic image in the computer program is always there somewhere in digital storage, and can be summoned back at the clack of a couple of keys.\u201d84 Its author\u2019s naive faith in undo buffers notwithstanding, the passage marks yet another important dissipation of architecture.",
        "If the Suburban Sets worked to undermine stable forms of suburban domesticity and the Telecom Slug\u2019s inherent multiplicity challenged the stable ontology of the architectural object, here, the architectural drawing itself, the very element with which Banham began the book, was threatened by a new technology.",
        "No longer bound to the physical artifacts produced through painstaking drawing, the act of designing was now recorded in ephemeral traces on the computer monitor.",
        "In another passage eerily resonant with contemporary digital design discourse and production, Banham praised Herron and his office for having \u201cthe sort of audacity to think in terms of presenting one of their projects as the architectural equivalent of a music video.\u201d85 Like the Sets and the Slug, the video, exhibited at the 1986 exhibition Vision der Moderne, pushed architectural thinking well beyond the traditional artifacts generated through drawing and building.86 At the same time, it challenged the received notions of the subjectivity of the architect.",
        "For Banham: Its all jolly Post Modern, not in the routine \u201cLook Mum l can do Palladian Windows\u201d architectural manner, but in the \u201cModes of Discourse about Discourse\u201d manner that had lately engaged the minds of heavier than architectural thinkers in academe.",
        "Like a Post Modern novelist abandoning the Almighty Author stance of traditional writers in favour of the more mod est Untrustworthy Narrator posture of the writer who is part of his own fiction, Ron Herron presents himself in the video as part of his own design project, far more convincingly than does, say, James Stirling in the famous perspectives of his own Olivetti Milton Keynes project.",
        "For, where the draftsmanly convention of Rob Krier\u2019s [sic]87 drawings of and for Stirling cannot but present Big Jim as the Almighty Architect of tradition, Ron Herron, speaking in propria voce from the overgrown private garden behind his own computer simulation, presents himself as a user friendly illusion just like you or me (only without making a big deal out of it, like some novelist hung up on \u201cnarratology\u201d).",
        "The architect who has always been metaphorically at home with technology, here \u2014 thanks to his personal computer appears as a mean sensual man who is literally at home in technology.",
        "And, perhaps, in that flourishing backyard that is real despite the graphic illusions of robot domesticity by which we have come at it, he can begin to discern for us that elusive essence of technology that technologists cannot elucidate\u2014without ever ceasing to be the architect he has always been.88 In the end, Banham offered a vision of architecture dissipated into the flux of digital design and the architect absorbed into the virtual ether of his illusory animations.",
        "And while such iconoclastic work tore at the heart of received conventions \u2014 indeed it had \u201clittle to do with the ancient vocabularies of disegno\u201d \u2014 and distinctly intertwined the subjectivity of the architect with the objective (if virtual) realities he or she created, the architecture remained undeniably real, and its designer remained unequivocally an architect.",
        "For while \u201cthe software names will mostly fade from importance, the endeavor that bends them to the architectural will can never fade, however \u2014not while architecture persists, not while architects like Ron Herron persist in making architecture.\u201d89 Expanding on his important late career concept,90 Banham explained that making architecture did not necessarily involve the act of building but rather the \u201crevelation of truth,\u201d an idea he gleaned from Martin Heidegger\u2019s essay \u201cThe Question Concerning Technology.\u201d91 As Banham put it, \u201cAll the breakthroughs toward an architecture of technology have been, in a literal sense, revelations\u2014of how to make architecture, that pure creation of the human spirit, out of concrete, or steel, or glass, or whatever.",
        "And each revelation that has comprehended or uncovered an essence\u2014the Villa Savoye, the Farnsworth House, just as much as the Pantheon or La Sainte Chapelle\u2014has been a truth out of which architects can make architecture.\u201d Further, \u201cNot all such revelations have to be buildings.",
        "They could be a paragraph from Ruskin\u2019s Stones of Venice, or Geoffrey Scott\u2019s Architecture of Humanism, or even Asimov\u2019s Caves of Steel.\u201d Banham continued: But, then, the work of the architect as he bends over the paper, pencil in hand, is all illusion.",
        "He produces simulacra of reality, diagrams which, by some form of sympathetic magic, are supposed to cause real buildings to happen out in the instrumental world.",
        "We all know that it is not sympathetic magic but a vast and frequently fallible industrial complex that will turn the illusory vision into real construction but, for architects, the moment of magic, the revelation of truth, is when pencil marks the paper, and the process of making architecture begins.92 Even the title of the chapter from which these lines are quoted, \u201cOutlines of Real Illusions,\u201d reinforced Banham\u2019s claim that all of architecture\u2019s artifacts, whether drawn, animated, written, or built, are each equally and undeniably real.",
        "Herron\u2019s drawings, though perhaps \u201csimulacra of reality,\u201d fundamentally are not mere representations of buildings.",
        "Rather, they are instantiations of Banham\u2019s earlier concept of \u201carchitecture as \u2018an image.\u2019\u201d93 Herron\u2019s images demonstrate that, for Banham, architecture is less a matter of constructed buildings than of applied technique, and the sense of conviction they convey, as Banham made clear in his late writings, confirms that some of the field\u2019s most important achievements have been realized not in the realm of building construction but rather in the production of architecture beyond building.",

        "Banham expressed a measure of dismay at this occlusion of architectural objects with planting and earthwork, and he closed by suggesting the possibility of a renewed appreciation of the corporate glass box shorn of its verdant disguise: \u201cWhatever the present preoccupation with external imagery and cosmetic shrubbery, it will need only a slight shift of corporate vision for the basic box to be found admirable for its simplicity and for Digital and IBM Santa Teresa to be praised for their naked honesty.",

        "Refusing the New Brutalism\u2019s coherent imagery and clip on\u2019s \u201cunity of effect,\u201d at Willis Faber, Foster offered a dizzying melange of reflected architectural incident on the building\u2019s mirror glass facade (see pis.",

        "Where exposed services and structure signaled clear and honest expression for New Brutalist, clip on, and High Tech works, Foster answered with an exterior that effaced tectonic expression and interior spaces that betrayed nothing of the environmental and communication technologies at work beyond their raised floors and suspended ceilings (see fig.",

        "Of the nine architectural qualities Banham articulated for the New Brutalism, clip on, and High Tech (see table 1, p.",
        "154), Foster\u2019s work exhibited just one \u2014 bold colors\u2014but even this was limited to interior finish systems such as floor coverings.",
        "Further, and unlike other \u201csmart sheds\u201d Banham used to indicate High Tech\u2019s \u201cOpposite Case,\u201d Willis Faber did not offer much in the way of enhanced environmental performance,9 nor did it align with Alfred Barr\u2019s triple formula for the International Style.",
        "Its volumes are not planar but bulbous, its massing is far from regular, and its glass surfaces, while unadorned, are replete with fragmented contextual reflections by day and revealed interior incident by night \u2014 a far cry from Barr\u2019s canonical blankness.",
        "Banham\u2019s modern traits of clarity, honesty, and unity are likewise in short supply, with obscurity, dissimulation, and what Banham termed \u201ca nicely judged eclecticism\u201d much more readily at hand.10 While these latter qualities soon would be associated with flagship examples of architectural postmodernism, it would be difficult, given the building\u2019s earnest functionality and lack of overt referentiality, to argue convincingly for alignment with that style.",
        "Rather, Willis Faber stands as a defiant catalog of exclusions: neither New Brutalist nor clip on nor High Tech; neither International Style nor modern nor postmodern.",
        "Further, boasting as it does a suspended glass facade, cantilevered floor slabs, and vast open plan interiors, Willis Faber flaunted the final set of criteria Banham offered in \u201cA Black Box\u201d: the building is neither masonry nor compressive nor closed.",
        "By Ban ham\u2019s final definition, Foster\u2019s building is not even architecture at all.",
        "If Ron Herron\u2019s career heralded the possibility of architecture beyond building, with Willis Faber, Foster took the opposite approach to deliver a mode of building beyond architecture.",
        "Though there is ample evidence of architectural intelligence on display, there is little celebration of architecture as such at Willis Faber.",
        "Writing in the Architectural Review, Christopher Woodward pointed out that the designers were unwilling \u201cformally to monumentalize any one of the main elements of the building, neither structure, services, nor the usual paraphernalia of modules.\u201d11 Ban ham, for his part, described how the secondary structure of the exterior glazing \u201chas been refined away almost, but not quite, to nothing, a clamp bar to hang the glass from at the top, and a patch plate at each corner where the four plates meet.",
        "Otherwise, there is nothing except a translucent line of sealant between each sheet [of glass] and the next, optically lost in the inevitable refractions and reflections that occur at any cut edge of glass.\u201d12 And as architectural interest was effaced at the level of the details, so too did it dissipate as one moved through the building.",
        "Ban ham explained: \u201cThe rising plane of the escalator through the generous central light well makes one look at, and think about other matters.",
        "It is a building to be explored before it is understood, and for this reason its levels of technology, servicing, and energy consumption are not to be read by snap judgment or any single viewpoint.\u201d13 As was the case at James Stirling\u2019s Olivetti Training Center and Richard Rogers\u2019s building for Lloyd\u2019s of London, Banham the detail connoisseur gave way here to Banham the flaneur.",
        "Moving around the facility\u2019s undulating perimeter, one does not encounter an emphatic architectural object but rather a reflected and refracted re presentation of its immediate context (see pis.",
        "18,19).",
        "And if the exterior morphs into a cinematic display of virtual images animated by the roving eye of the mobile observer, moving within only amplifies the project\u2019s promiscuous slide toward adjacent fields of disciplinary expertise.",
        "For the \u201cother matters\u201d one is compelled to look at and think about on the \u201crising plane of the escalator\u201d are not architectural in the least.",

        "The effect is at once disarmingly pleasant and shocking.",
        "At no point along this sequence from urban street through corporate interior to bucolic park does one find anything even remotely monumental in the conventional architectural sense.",

        "To assist in the translation, Hastings\u2019s article was followed by Cullen\u2019s eleven page \u201cCasebook\u201d of principles to be adopted by the would be Townscape planner.",
        "Among the many critics of Townscape was the architect Basil Taylor, who in a 1954 BBC Radio talk attempted to draw sharp distinctions between modern architecture and these renovated picturesque principles.21 Nikolaus Pevsner\u2019s response to Taylor\u2014in which he remarked, \u201cThe modern revolution of the early twentieth century and the picturesque revolution of one hundred years before had all their fundamentals in common\u201d22 \u2014 sparked an intense partisan debate on the topic.",
        "\u201cHad Pevsner deliberately set out to infuriate the young,\u201d Banham opined, \u201che could hardly have done better.\u201d23 Alan Colquhoun issued a stern rebuke of Pevsner\u2019s position,24 and later, following Pevsner\u2019s \u201cEnglishness of English Art\u201d radio addresses on the BBC, a flurry of critical reactions appeared, including Colin Rowe\u2019s condemnation of \u201cthe insufferable tedium of Townscape.\u201d25 As outlined at the outset of the present book, many of the younger generation reacted against the Review by embracing a geometrically disciplined modern classicism introduced via Le Corbusier and Rudolf Wittkower.26 But as Banham pointed out, these attempts were undermined by a growing distance between the rigid geometries of classical form and advances in technology, mathematics, and other influences during the 1950s and \u201960s.",
        "In moving away from classical forms, many architects inadvertently moved their work directly toward the neopicturesque tendencies they proclaimed to resist.",
        "As Banham put it, \u201cSuch \u2018scientific\u2019 concepts as open endedness, the promulgation of growth and change as qualities to be incorporated in building designs, and the acceptance of expendability and impermanence, all combined to bring on a kind of architecture, and architectural philosophy, that must have looked reassuringly familiar to the editors of the Architectural Review.\u201d27 In his articulation of Uvedale Price\u2019s theory of the picturesque, De Wolfe [Hastings] outlined an \u201cEnglish Revolt\u201d against the \u201cGrand Manner\u201d of French classical planning.",
        "The \u201cradical\u201d English approach contrasted the \u201crational\u201d French method by advancing independence over equality, the particular over the universal, parts over wholes, the real over the ideal, and increasing complexity over increasing conformity.28 Banham prized exactly these values, not least among them radicalism, throughout his career.",
        "He and his colleagues at the Review also shared an unabashed commitment to functional accommodation, a pragmatic approach that addressed each problem on its own merits, a tendency to foreground architecture's visual aspects, and a soft spot for disciplinary outsiders.",
        "These associations point to a final paradox in Banham\u2019s late writings.",
        "On one hand, Banham left behind a near classical definition of architecture as achieved through closed, compressive, masonry works.",
        "On the other, he cleaved to the distinctly modern values of clarity, honesty, and unity.",
        "Canonical High Tech works such as Centre Pompidou rejected the former values but retained the latter, suggesting either the possibility of an architecture that eschewed traditional \u201cmaterials and methods\u201d while espousing modern values or the possibility that High Tech represented a mode of building that operated somewhere outside the disciplinary ken.29 The \u201cOpposite Case\u201d at Willis Faber went even further toward the possibility of building beyond architecture by eluding all six of Banham\u2019s categories and dissolving into an experiential milieu constructed primarily of interiors and landscape.",
        "Whether or not one chooses to label it architecture, Centre Pompidou rightfully inherited Banham\u2019s \u201cother\u201d tradition extending from Victorian engineering via Giedion through constructivism and clip on into canonical High Tech.",
        "Willis Faber and other examples of Banham\u2019s \u201cOpposite Case,\u201d however, suggested an altogether different historical lineage with claims to the parentage of High Tech\u2014another \u201cother\u201d that moves back via Pevsner through Townscape, the International Style, and nineteenth century eclecticism to the picturesque.",
        "In accommodating these contrasting affiliations, Banham\u2019s late writings on High Tech hold in paradoxical suspension dichotomies with which he had wrestled throughout his career: on one hand, an architecture of rigorous formal coherence and memorable visual images; on the other, an architecture of dissonant juxtaposition with a tendency to dissipate into adjacent fields of cultural production.",
        "In High Tech, Banham found both a progressive aesthetic suffused with \u201coperational lore\u201d and a responsible ethic charged with \u201capparent intelligence.\u201d He also found a method of working suitable for the construction of monumental symbols of contemporary culture and equipped to handle the quotidian challenges of \u201cnine to five\u201d practice.",
        "In High Tech buildings, he found compellingly articulated details to satisfy learned connoisseurs dispersed within immersive experiential milieus that accommodated distracted flaneurs; and, in its architects, he found a staunch commitment to architecture\u2019s most storied traditions coupled with a firm resolve, when necessary, to militate against unproductive habits and conventions.",
        "Tragically, Banham\u2019s life was cut short before he could marshal these dichotomies into the chapters of Making Architecture: The Paradoxes of High Tech.",
        "In this unfinished chronicle of both a visual style and an operative technique, Banham was poised not to resolve High Tech\u2019s paradoxes but rather to instrumentalize them to explain a mode of \u201cmaking architecture\u201d suffused, like his own writing, with clarity, honesty, and unity as well as with complexity, invention, diversity...",

        "The Salomon REYNER BANHAM ski boot, which has been called High Tech by some writers, appears not to contain many significantly \u201chigher\u201d technologies than have been available in other downhill boots, but its visual presentation has been very skillfully styled to emphasize whatever claims to technical superiority it may possess.",
        "The Moulton cycle, described as \u201cadvanced engineering\u201d by its manufacturer, on the other hand, derives its appearance almost entirely from the engineering techniques involved in its design and construction, which are indeed unique to this type of bicycle, rather than from any self conscious decision about what style to employ.",
        "And one may admit that neither of these two statements is necessarily one hundred percent absolutely true; the styling of the Salomon boot probably does derive in part from innovations in its materials and mode of fabrication, and the apparent absence of self conscious styling from the Moulton may itself derive from some barely formulated aesthetic preferences on the part of Alex Moulton, the patron of the company that makes them.",
        "As applied to architecture, which is our main (but not exclusive) business here, the term High Tech often seems to partake of the sense of Advanced Engineering as well as that of visual style and therefore can mean anything from \u201cslickly mechanistic presentation\u201d to \u201cat the cutting edge of environmental technology\u201d\u2014and it can mean either or both of them in any ratio of admixture and at any level from the purely factual to the strictly visual to the clearly mythological.",
        "In their book High Tech: The Industrial Style and Source Book for the Home, which was the first to use the phrase in its title, and popularized the term among general readers interested in design, the authors, Joan Kron and Suzanne Slesin, derive the phrase itself from \u201cHigh Style\u201d and seem to be unaware that, in architectural circles at least, the phrase \u201cHigh Technology\u201d had been in use since the very late 1960s.",
        "Furthermore, they seem to use and interpret the term as no more than the label for a particular fashion for using industrial (or industrial looking) products in home furnishing and interior decorating, though most of the designs and produits trouves which they illustrate are probably better described as merely \u201cFunctional\u201d since few are advanced in their engineering, and equally few exhibit self conscious styling beyond choice of paint colors.",
        "This basically Functionalist quality may be the reason they felt justified in invoking in their introduction the whole mythology of the Modern Movement in architecture\u2014 the opening words of their first chapter claim (with the utmost historical insouciance) that \u201cthe industrial aesthetic was born in 1851 when Sir Joseph Paxton, an engineer and gardener, designed and built the vast Crystal Palace.\u201d1 Whether or not this statement is accurate or historically useful, it represents a version of a proposition that every member of the Modern Movement in architecture has accepted as something like religious dogma since the beginning of the present century and was taught to all the architects of the High Tech generation while they were still at architecture school.",
        "This almost un thought phrase of Kron and Slesin should alert us to the kind of deep and diffuse underpinnings on which High Tech as an attitude and as a body of design practice claims to be founded.",
        "One cannot understand High Tech, nor the accusations of \u201cnostalgia\u201d that are often levelled at it, without understanding the nature of this mythology of \u201cLes Grands Constructeurs du XIX Siecle,\u201d founded on the works of Sigfried Giedion and Nikolaus Pevsner, and its permeation throughout the ideology of Modernist design in the present century.",
        "There are, however, other kinds of mythologies at work in the general understandings of High Tech, and of those who have taken a stand in opposition to it.",
        "Chief of these is the Mythology of Technical Ignorance.",
        "Thus the one thing that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d about the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the building designed by Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, which serves as the High Tech \u201cmonument of definition\u201d for Kron and Slesin (and most other writers) is that it is supposed to \u201clook like an oil refinery!\u201d In fact, it looks like nothing of the sort, this mythology depends on a general ignorance of engineering among the \u201cculturati,\u201d and if Pompidou resembles any other class of building at all, it is a particular type of steam powered electrical generating station that is favored in California.",
        "Yet this strikingly clear resemblance to the California power stations has never entered into the general body of discourse about either the Centre or about High Tech in general.",
        "Such anecdotal mythologies of ignorance, based upon the technical unawareness of humanists, have encumbered critical and historical writing about Modern Architecture since its beginnings but have been made worse in recent years by that recrudescence of hostility to all forms of technology among Western intellectuals, which is discussed later in this chapter.",
        "A more suggestive and extremely instructive type of mythologizing appears in a very strange observation on aeronautical design by the Italian industrial designer and proponent of \u201cBio design,\u201d Luigi Colani: The Battle of Britain fought in 1940 revealed very interesting examples of biodesign as seen in aircraft.",
        "The two adversaries in this decisive air battle were the German Messerschmitt 109 and the British Spitfire.",
        "The former was a hi tech squarish looking plane, while the Spitfire looked more like a fish than a plane, with its oval shaped fluke like wings and soft aero design.",
        "Messerschmitt was a stubborn man and he ignored the advice of his aerodynamic expert Edgar Schmued who was better aware of what a high speed fighter should look like.",
        "Schmued quit Messerschmitt and went to America.",
        "There he designed for North American Aviation the P 51 Mustang\u2014a bio look Messerschmitt with softer lines and better aerodynamics.",
        "The fact that both the bio Spitfire and the bio derivative of the Messerschmitt, the P 51 Mustang, were both superior to the hard headed, hi tech design of the German plane makes a very funny biodesign inside story.",
        "For one could say that bio design won the Battle of Britain!2 Whatever else may be wrong with this passage, in terms of military history or aeronautics, its main offense must surely be that it goes against common sense \u2014 if the Spitfires were so superior as a fighting machine, then surely it must have been more \"High Tech\u201d than the Bfi09, rather than the other way about.",
        "Clearly, Colani is not talking about technology but is exercising a private system of aesthetics or iconography\u2014except that the system is not so private; much conversation and critical writing on these topics uses the term \u201cHigh Tech\u201d to mean something like what Colani appears to mean here: \u201cresembling the appearance of machines as they were understood in the classic literature of Modernism of the Twenties and Thirties.\u201d Most alert and currently well informed readers, confronted with these remarks of Colani\u2019s, would know exactly what he intended, even if they knew that the words would be nonsense in any other context.",
        "Almost all discourse employing the term \u201cHigh Tech\u201d tends to vacillate between a purely stylistic reading at one extreme and a genuine appreciation of technological matters at the other, and any study of the topic which intends to do justice to it must recognize and incorporate this variability, even at the risk of some confusion.",
        "And since this study will be discussing architecture, not simply engineering, the symbolic elements and other traditional aspects of architecture as a civic art\u2014\u201cstyle,\u201d that is \u2014 are an essential part of the cultural pretensions and rewards of the High Tech adventure.",
        "Again, the rise of High Tech must be seen in the context of a number of hostile counter mythologies, quite apart from the accusations of technical nostalgia, and/or ineradicable suspicions about the actual technical qualities of the buildings themselves.",
        "Of these counter mythologies, the most significant was, obviously, the general hostility to Technology that has already been mentioned.",
        "The period of the rise of High Tech is conveniently bracketed by two books that expressed the pro foundest misgivings about Technology as a force in design and in the world at large.",
        "The first was La Speranza Progettuale (Design, Nature, and Revolution) by Tomas Maldonado, which had first appeared in 1970.",
        "Since Maldonado had been head of the immensely influential Hochschule fur Gestaltung at Ulm in Germany, where he had seemed bent on revivifying Functionalism by injections of Information Theory, Cybernetics, and Systems Analysis, his apparent defection from Technological Modernism was the more provocative and, as will be observed below in the case of Porsche Design, the more paradoxical.",
        "This was, however, something of an \u201cinside\u201d affair, a designer turning against technological enthusiasms in design; the second book was more general and encyclopedic in its scope and, published in 1977, appeared in the year that Centre Pompidou was opened.",
        "This was Autonomous Technology by the MIT sociologist Langdon Winner; not a work of noisy polemic like so many of the Anti Tech tracts of the earlier 1970s, it was more of a grand survey of all the doubts about technology\u2019s place in society that had been expressed by major thinkers like H.G.",
        "Wells, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Paul Goodman, Herbert Marcuse, and Henri Lefeb vre down to Alvin Toffler.",
        "Nevertheless, Winner\u2019s introduction does include a prime quotation of early 1960s Techno paranoia, from Mario Savio\u2019s famous speech at the very beginning of the student disturbances at Berkeley: \u201cThere is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at the heart that you can\u2019t take part; you can\u2019t even passively take part, and you\u2019ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you\u2019ve got to make it stop.\u201d3 Though it will be clear that Savio\u2019s \u201cMachine\u201d is a metaphor for a whole social and political system, the very use of such a metaphor of hostility is a fair indication of the kind of disrepute that Technology\u2014understood or misunderstood \u2014 was about to enter in academic circles.",
        "Autonomous Technology, for all its carefully academic tone of voice, presents an intellectual prospect so bleak that it remains almost incredible that, in the year of its publication, there should also be a celebration of the apparent pleasures of technology as exuberant as Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers\u2019s colorful culture machine on the Plateau Beaubourg.",
        "The subsequent rise and consolidation of the High Tech \u201cmovement\u201d thus took place in a doubly hostile intellectual environment, caught between extreme pessimism about Autonomous Technology on the one hand, and the return of Revivalist architecture, in the guise of Post Modernism, on the other.",
        "It is clear, therefore, that High Tech must have been securely rooted in a powerful sense of self confidence (or moral self justification) among its architects and a knowing (or indifferent) resistance to current intellectual fashions among the clients who commissioned [it.] The architectural and historical critical complexities that must be faced in considering High Tech architecture are therefore profound but rewarding, wide ranging but ultimately even more instructive about the nature of architecture than about technology.",
        "For let it be emphasized here, as it will be throughout this study, High Tech has far more to do with architecture than it does with Technology, even though it would be inconceivable without the availability of certain materials and techniques and the example and vital contributions of certain engineers.",
        "The kind of architectural and technological issues that are at stake will be demonstrated here in a \u201cfirst approximation\u201d argument by comparing two buildings that both answer to most of the commonly held views of High Tech architecture.",
        "Between them they display most of the characteristics of the \u201cstyle\u201d however it be defined; both are in England, barely thirty miles apart, and designed by British architectural offices, but they serve two continental European automobile manufacturers with strong claims to be at the cutting edge of automotive technology because of their successes in competition: Porsche and Renault.",
        "They also serve substantially similar functions involving customer relations and the storage and distribution of spare parts.",
        "In architectural terms they could hardly be more different, however, yet both have been confidently identified as \u201cHigh Tech,\u201d albeit with qualifications.",
        "The Porsche building of 1986, designed by the Dewhurst Haslam Partnership, probably comes closer to the general public\u2019s idea of what High Tech should be like, and this is not surprising since the architects clearly gave attention to the creation of imagery sympathetic to the company\u2019s products: \u201cHaving decided that one elevational treatment must convey the company\u2019s image, the architects felt that it should somehow relate to the company\u2019s product, perhaps the most highly engineered production car on the road,\u201d wrote Stephen Trombley,4 in his extended account of the building\u2019s design \u2014but without observing that \u201cthe company\u2019s product,\u201d in the eyes of many of the public, would tend to include not only cars but also the various items of non automotive luxury consumer merchandise, such as watches and sunglasses, that are marketed under the brand Porsche Design and enjoy a prestige that derives in part from the competition successes of the cars and in part from their styling, which corresponds well to what style conscious members of the public in the 1980s supposed High Tech to be.",
        "And it is not only the non architectural public who read Porsche Design as \u201cHigh Tech\u201d\u2014the first example of der High tech Asthetik cited in a polemical article of 1986 by the German architectural historian Volcker Fisher, \u201cTechnologie als Fetisch: High tech in Architektur und Design,\u201d is Porsche Design\u2019s celebrated Feuerzeug (cigarette lighter) of 1984,5 a typically and conventionally reticent/elegant product that acquires \u201cesteem by association\u201d by having the Porsche name on it, regardless of functional merit or technical qualities (which in this case are both high, as is the price!).",
        "Among well informed, affluent, fashion conscious consumers, Porsche was thus a name with distinct stylistic, as well as technical, connotations.",
        "Dewhurst Haslam thus had the conspicuous advantage, not often enjoyed by even High Tech architects, of working with a corporate imagery that was understood by a wide public, but it was also directly applicable to buildings, since it employed an imagery born of the same modernist tradition as their architecture.",
        "Ferdinand Alexander Porsche III, chief of the car company and later of Porsche Design, had received a crucial part of his design training at the Hochschule fur Gestaltung at Ulm, one of the focal institutions of technical/aesthetic Modernism in the 1950s when its dominant teacher was Tomas Maldonado.",
        "The Porsche 911, which he designed shortly after leaving the HfG, may well be the first example of \u201cHigh Tech\u201d in the sense which is being discussed here, because it has also been (together with the products of Mercedes Benz and BMW) one of the sacred objects of the mythology of German technological mastery, the legend of Vorsprung durch Technik.",
        "This anchorage in the older traditions of Modernism is underlined by the architects\u2019 own definition of the Porsche building\u2019s style as being \u201chigh tech...",
        "but high tech classic.",
        "Not high tech innovatory.\u201d6 The outcome of this attitude, as it is seen by drivers approaching the Porsche building from the motorway, is a long, twenty two bay two story facade of brushed aluminum cladding panels of \u201chard, grey metallic appearance\u201d and dark glass strip windows.",
        "Each letter of the Porsche company\u2019s famous logo occupies almost the full width of one 4.5 meter panel on the upper facade, and the elevation finishes as a flat, straight, and uninterrupted cornice line.",
        "The roof, in fact, is not absolutely flat but is interrupted by the thirty six glazed pyramids that cover the internal atrium, but none of this can be perceived from ground level at normal viewing distances.",
        "The architectural image is an uninflected square box; a classic \u2014not to say conventional \u2014Modernist package, neat and smooth and as reticently elegant as the non automotive products of Porsche Design.",
        "This tightly packaged image not only conceals the facts about the roof layout, but it also fails to acknowledge the functional differentiations of the interior of the building.",
        "As the Porsche company\u2019s operational base in Britain, it has to provide reception areas for customer relations, administrative offices, a large service bay where newly delivered cars are made ready for delivery, and an even larger area for receiving, storing, and dispatching spare parts (engine testing and other \u201cdirty\u201d functions are in a separate structure).",
        "Only some changes in the fenestration of the upper story of the facade give any clue that there might be internal functional differences, and these cannot be made to yield any specific information about which function is where.",
        "The style of the exterior is marked by precisely that \u201canonymity\u201d that has always been one of the more mythological characteristics of Modern Architecture \u2014but also one of the prized qualities of the \u201cBlack Box\u201d approach to the case work for high technology equipment (though one should observe that the most admired boxes, from Max Braun to Saxpy computers, have been grey or beige).",
        "One should also pause to observe that there is no necessary connection between architecture that is in any of the styles that have been termed \u201cHigh Tech\u201d and the presence of \u201chigh technology\u201d or even advanced engineering in the building, either as a function to be housed or as an aid to the better structural or environmental performance of the building shell.",
        "Of all the buildings known to the author, the one which contains the very highest technology, the most advanced engineering must be the Stanford Linear Accelerator Facility in California.",
        "The contents of the building are, chiefly, a two mile long evacuated steel tube in which super conducted electromagnets produce 20 billion electron volts of energy to accelerate a beam of sub atomic particles to almost the speed of light.",
        "The building that houses this wonder machine is a simple and almost character less corrugated metal shed that extends over two miles of territory but is otherwise totally unremarkable in any sense relevant to architecture as an art.",
        "Contrariwise, some of the most visually elaborate and highly finished works of High Tech architecture have, in fact, no more than rhetorical or mythological connection with any advanced technology or engineering.",
        "At Porsche, however, there seems to be a good correlation between the claims to quality and performance implicit in the style of architecture and the actual quality and performance of the building.",
        "Not only do the external cladding systems, for instance, give the total building envelope excellent thermal characteristics, balancing heat gains and losses so that heating is needed for only the coldest eight weeks of the year, but this is also, in the current phrase, a \u201cSmart Building\u201d\u2014it uses its own computer and installed circuitry not only for the customary business purposes but also to monitor and control its environmental installations as a self regulating system.",
        "The concept of the Smart Building is only one of the ramifications of the impact of the use of computers or buildings in architecture.",
        "Computerization already affects all aspects of design from the initial feasibility studies and cost analysis to the final production drawings, the management of the construction site, and the building itself when completed.",
        "It is one of the ironies of the High Tech period that the ready availability of computerization, one of the higher technologies now within the reach of all but the most modest architectural offices, has had almost no effect on the style or appearance of buildings, nor is there any reason why it should \u2014 so that any purported references to computer technologies in the appearance of buildings are therefore purely symbolic.",
        "Smart systems aside, however, Porsche may indeed be judged \"Classic\u201d and \u201cNot innovatory\u201d as its architects claimed.",
        "Its view of architecture and design, both inside and outside, holds closely to the three distinguishing principles of Modern architecture of the International Style in the version set out by Alfred H.",
        "Barr as long ago as 1932: \u201cThe distinguishing aesthetic principles of the International Style...are three: emphasis upon volume\u2014space enclosed by thin planes or surfaces as opposed to the suggestion of mass or solidity; regularity as opposed to symmetry or other kinds of obvious balance; and, lastly, dependence upon the intrinsic elegance of materials, technical perfection, and fine proportions as opposed to applied ornament.\u201d7 Although the brushed metal surfaces around the central atrium inside the Porsche building, the lavish planting, the fountains, and the programmed lighting that complements the play of water may represent a very extreme \u201cLate Modern\u201d version of the International Style, everything is still reassuringly familiar to the visitor.",
        "If the design of the Porsche building had been described as \u201cOff the shelf components and off the shelf thinking,\u201d this in no way derogates the quality of its construction, the immense competence of its resolutely conventional design, its functional serviceability, or the satisfaction that it clearly affords to the company and the customers \u2014 both owners and agents\u2014who come to use it...",
        "But if it is compared to the 1983 Renault building at Swindon, which serves almost exactly the same purposes, it can only appear less inspired, however stylish, and (apparently) less innovatory.",
        "Against Porsche\u2019s sleek exterior \u201cwithout rhetoric\u201d (to revive Peter Smithson\u2019s phrase to characterize the grau im grau boxwork of Braun radio, another manifestation of the HfG at Ulm), Renault flourishes its expressed and articulated structural system on the exterior, outside the enclosed envelope that forms its functional volume.",
        "This system is a tracery of tensile rods stabilizing a regular grid of yellow upright columns joined by braced bridging girders that support the roofing membrane, all in striking contrast with both the greenfield site on which it sits in splendid isolation and the matte grey metallic panels of the enclosing walls, set back a full meter behind the external skeleton and across which the structure casts elegant shadows even in the misty British sunlight.",
        "In striking contrast to Porsche, again, the roof line is not flat, but acknowledges the fact that each 25 meter square bay of the structure is roofed by a kind of stiff tent formed by the bridging girders and suspended by more tensile rods from the tops of the upright columns that form its corners like tent poles.",
        "Nor is the plan a neat rectangle, as at Porsche.",
        "Although the main spare parts store is indeed a rectangle, four bays by nine bays, there are six other bays added at the \u201cpublic\u201d end of the building that destroy any visual sense of that rectangle\u2014the most visible of them, indeed, being an open sided canopy over a parking space for visitors.",
        "This not only destroys any sense of the enclosing walls as a substantial part of the building but puts the emphasis instead on the skeletal system of uprights and tension rods and bridging girders that support the roof tents, and thus serves to explain, as it were, the whole generating system of the design.",
        "Similar as its functions may be to those of Porsche, physically and commercially, there are clearly a range of other considerations that serve to set the two operations apart conceptually, and \u2014aside from differences of architectural temperament\u2014 the most important of these is concerned with company imagery.",
        "Success in competition, and the kind of engineering resourcefulness that is needed to win races and rallies have played a large part in the public relations of the Regie Renault, but since these matters were manifested in specialized competition vehicles remote from the Renault models the public can actually buy (whereas all Porsches are sports cars), they are not integrated into the public\u2019s view of the company\u2019s everyday products.",
        "Nor is there a parallel high style product brand like Porsche Design to reinforce an imagery of high performance and high technology.",
        "Foster Associates therefore had neither the help nor the limitations of an architecturally relevant company image when they came to design the building, and the only connection one may perceive is that the yellow color of the exposed structure is more or less the same as the livery that was used on Renault\u2019s Formula One Racing cars \u2014 but, then, such a yellow is also notoriously one of the favorite colors of Norman Foster, whose office designed the building, for his own personal vehicles, from bicycles to helicopters.",
        "Furthermore, yellow is also one of the preferred colors of High Tech as a \u201cmovement.\u201d It \u2014 and a variety of related greens, as well as reds and blues \u2014 appears frequently in the work of Rogers and other practitioners of the style, and it thus makes it easier to see Foster\u2019s work of this kind as part of a coherent and deliberated tendency in recent architecture.",
        "Indeed, it was the publication of Renault that provided the occasion for the Architectural Review to produce, in July 1983, what appears to be the first special issue of any professional magazine to be devoted specifically to High Tech as an architectural movement in being, rather than a putative tendency, and to an attempted assessment of the movement\u2019s background and value systems.",
        "The use of such bright, usually primary colors \u2014in opposition to the \u201ccanonical white\u201d (and occasional earth tones) of the International Style\u2014together with a conspicuous exhibition of structure, might speculatively be taken as two of a set of three \u201cdistinguishing principles\u201d of High Tech architecture as a style, to match Barr\u2019s three principles of the International Style.",
        "In that case, the third principle would probably be something like \u201cexposure of mechanical and environmental services,\u201d as exemplified by the exterior of Centre Pompidou and the interiors of works such as the University Medical Center at Calgary, Alberta, by Eb Zeidler and Associates.",
        "Yet, if this were a test of orthodoxy, so to speak, it is one that Foster\u2019s work would normally fail.",
        "Since the Renault building was not deemed to need heavy servicing, there was not originally much ductwork or trunking that could be exposed.",
        "Certainly it can be seen if one knows where to look, but not to the same explicit and dramatic effect as in the work of Rogers, for instance.",
        "Indeed, it is the spectacular servicing of Centre Pompidou, together with its exhibitionistic structure and its brilliant coloring (though the yellow is missing for once!) that make it the monument of reference by which High Tech Architecture is usually defined.",
        "Structure, Services, and Color\u2014these may well be called the three distinguishing stylistic principles of High Tech, but only in opposition to Barr\u2019s three principles of the International Style.",
        "For between High Tech and the International Style, there is one of the most notable and instructive oppositions (or, at least, distinctions) that has appeared in the history of Modern architecture as a fine art, and it is a distinction that throws an interesting light on the way that Modernism in architecture has construed (or misconstrued) its own history.",
        "The main issue can be summarized thus: the major historical accounts of the sources of Modern architecture in the immediately pre Modern phase, most notably Pevsner\u2019s Pioneers of Modem Design and Giedion\u2019s Bauen in Frankreich, Bauen in Eisen, Bauen in Eisenbeton, tend to present views of the architecture of the nineteenth century which did not connect, visually, with the kind of twentieth century architecture that these historian apologists supported and claimed to be descended from them.",
        "Briefly, the buildings of the Grands Constructeurs, like Paxton and Eiffel, who were so admired by historians of that generation, tended to be open work, transparent, with clearly expressed structural skeletons, whereas the International Style work of Giedion\u2019s friends Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, or Pevsner\u2019s hero, Gropius, tended to consist of closed volumes whose structural skeletons were not easily perceived nor\u2014indeed \u2014part of the visual design of the building.",
        "Thus, in order to provide a respectable nineteenth century parentage for Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Weis senhof apartment block of 1927 by comparing it to the pioneering metal framed structure of the famous Chocolat Menier factory, for instance, Giedion has to illustrate the Mies building in the unfinished condition, with its steel frame still visible,8 which clearly was not how Mies intended his building to be seen.",
        "Nevertheless, there has for a long time been another tradition within architectural Modernism, often visionary and unbuilt, which \u2014 unlike the International Style \u2014 has seemed more directly affiliated to the work of Les Grands Constructeurs: Constructivism and its derivatives.",
        "This was the kind of architecture which was celebrated in the Frankfurt Museum\u2019s exhibition Vision der Moderne in 1986, and seems to have been regarded by many (including the exhibition\u2019s organizers) as a kind of \u201crevenge of the other modern architecture.\u201d It might be better to regard the works of this tradition simply as the realization of some unused possibilities of the Modern tradition, but however the case is interpreted, it is clear that\u2014a few works like the Porsche building aside \u2014nearly all of what passes as High Tech in architecture belongs in that part of the Modern Movement, and not that which later became the orthodox International Style.",
        "What then of Porsche, which clearly does not belong on that Constructivist side, yet is widely (and convincingly) regarded as being of the High Tech persuasion? It is clear that High Tech is not simply a subdivision of \u201cConstructivist Architecture\u201d as the Frankfurt team have tended to maintain but has other roots and allegiances.",
        "It will be argued in this book that what constitutes the crucial novelty and difference between High Tech and the more generalized \u201cConstructive\u201d tradition is that High Tech takes a more than constructive view of architecture; [High Tech] does not see buildings simply as passive shelters against the elements, but rather as complete and active environmental systems, dispensing energy and information to maintain a well regulated ambiance for the building\u2019s functions.",
        "The appearance of a High Tech building normally offers the explicit promise, and hopefully the physical delivery, of superior environmental performance.",
        "Hence, therefore, the important part played by exposed service ducting and visible environmental machinery \u2014 conspicuously absent from Constructivist projects \u2014in High Tech as a style.",
        "But even without such three dimensional symbolism, the high finish and the understood technological product affiliations of Porsche do at least offer an allegory of superior performance\u2014which, fortunately, is made real by the observable facts of the building\u2019s interior environment.",
        "In general, then, the argument of this book will be that High Tech, however variable its visual manifestations may be, along the scale from Porsche to Centre Pompidou, contains an implicit or explicit promise of higher performance than was the case in earlier architectures.",
        "This elevated performance might be structural, environmental, functional, but preferably all three, and it is understood to be obtained by recourse to the most advanced engineering technologies\u2014\u201ccutting edge\u201d as opposed to merely \u201cstate of the art\u201d\u2014available in all the relevant fields.",
        "And it is also, let us remind ourselves, still architecture, \u201cthe mother of the arts,\u201d with all that is implied in that traditional claim.",
        "Lay observers, however elevated their social rank, may perhaps be excused for superficially supposing otherwise, and the fact that they do suppose otherwise is, in a sense, a striking tribute to the symbolic power of the architectural forms they have employed.",
        "\u201cWell, Mr.",
        "Rogers,\u201d said the Prince of Wales at the opening of the Inmos factory in South Wales, \u201cit looks as though the engineers got their own way this time!\u201d9 The engineer in question, Tony Hunt, is universally accepted as having made crucial contributions to the structure, but closer study will show that architecture is still at work, still in ultimate control of design, most notably in the disposition of the ventilating ductwork, which is disposed as the architects wanted it, not as the servicing consultants had proposed.",
        "High Tech, it seems, is another step in the long struggle to bring innovative engineering techniques within the traditional disciplines of architecture, or to stretch those disciplines until the technologies can be accommodated within them.",
        "If I had to produce a first approximation definition of High Tech, one that would embrace the whole range from Porsche to Pompidou, I would be tempted to say that it was the most recent way of bringing advanced engineering within the discipline of architecture, comparable with the achievements of Peter Behrens and Auguste Perret in the first fifteen years of the present century.",
        "At the end of my first extended study of the history of Modern Architecture, I wrote: It may well be that what we have hitherto understood as architecture, and what we are beginning to understand of technology are incompatible disciplines.",
        "The architect who proposes to run with technology knows now that he will be in fast company, and that, in order to keep up, he may have to emulate the Futurists and discard his whole cultural load including the professional garments by which he is recognized as an architect.",
        "If, on the other hand, he decides not to do this, he may find that a technological culture has decided to go on without him.10 These words caused some offense at the time, but the subsequent twenty five years of architecture seem to have revealed a grain of truth in them; this challenge is, it now appears, one of the fundamentals of Modernist architecture.",
        "What I did not appreciate at the time, however, was how far some architects were prepared to go, in defiance of a rising tide of historical revivalism, in order to keep up with advanced engineering, but without divesting themselves of those \u201cprofessional garments.\u201d The achievement of architects of that particular persuasion is High Tech, an alternative Modernism that has arisen from what might be termed the \u201cdisgrace\u201d of the older Modernism of the International Style.",
        "What follows is an attempt to define, chronicle, and understand this alternative Modernism, which surprised the world of architecture by becoming successful against the grain of expectations in the ostensibly Post Modernist culture of the 1970s and \u201980s.",
        "NOTES Note to the reader: Reyner Banham\u2019s manuscript was clearly a draft; as such, minor changes have been made to bring consistency to the style, to correct minor spelling errors (including the addition of accents), and to improve readability through small changes to punctuation.",
        "For the most part, Banham\u2019s capitalization, British spellings, emphases, and use of quotation marks were retained.",
