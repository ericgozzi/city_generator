It challenges the normal understanding of modern architecture by proposing that it was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time: tuberculosis and its primary diagnostic tool, the X ray. Modern architecture and the X ray were born around the same time and evolved in parallel. While the X ray exposed the inside of the body to the public eye, the modern building unveiled its interior, dramatically inverting the relationship between private and public. Architects presented their buildings as a kind of medical instrument for protecting and enhancing the body and psyche. Beatriz Colomina traces the psychopathologies of twentieth century architecture\u2014from the trauma of tuberculosis to more recent disorders such as burn out syndrome and ADHD\u2014and the huge transformations of privacy and publicity instigated by diagnostic tools from X Rays to MRIs and beyond. She suggests that if we want to talk about the state of architecture today, we should look to the dominant obsessions with illness and the latest techniques of imaging the body\u2014and ask what effects they have on the way we conceive architecture.

It goes back at least to the year I arrived in New York, attheend of 1980,after studying architecture in Barcelona. Bysome impossibly good luck, I landed as a visiting'fellow at the NewYork Institute for the Humanities, then ru n by Richard Sennett, and with some extraordinary figures as senior fellows\u2014Carl Schorske, Wolfgang Schivelbusch, and Susan Sontag, among others. I was deeply attracted to the kind of interdisciplinary work they were doing. In particu lar, Sontag\u2019s///ness asMetaphor; which had recently been published, had an enormous influence on me. I started seeing modern architecture in terms of all the pathologies related to it, real or imagined\u2014agoraphobia, claustrophobia, nervous disorders, and, above all, tuberculosis and the obsession with hygiene,with germs,with fresh air.... I thought this would be a great topic for my dissertation and actually wrote about one hundred pages on it in some kind of feverish state induced by my intoxication with New York. But there was not yet a climate for that kind of inter disciplinaryresearch in architecture\u2014not in Barcelona, and not at Columbia University, either, where I was a visiting scholar the following year. So I ended up working on two canonical figures, Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier, and the relationships between modern architecture and the emerging media of its time\u2014photography, illustrated magazines,film, 1 Susan Sontag, handwritten notes on and so on. Itturned outthat the field of architecture was not tuberculosis pati ent m ThomasMann's readyfor that, either. Talking about media in architecture rnstan\u2019c*'1975 2 Susan Sontag (1933 2004), was anathema in the early 1980s, as if it were an attack on November 3,1972 7 i*\u00bb1l theobject,or revealinga dirty secret, cr even as ifthe media were a kind ofillness. Returning to the project on tuberculosis and modern architecture isfor me like tlie returnofthe repressed. Except that it has always been there in some kind oflatent form, like a virusthat surfaces every now and then in essays and conference papers, butnever completelytakesover.1 Sothis isthe project that I decided to work on during a sabbaticalyear at theAmerican Academy in Berlin andths Getty Research Institute in LosAngeles. I was planning to do something else. But or one of myfirst days atthe academy in Wannsee, I discovered that there had been several tuberculosis sanatoriums inthe area. The airthere was famously cleaner, and people from elsewhere in Berlin cameto Wannsee forthe cure. fig.3 So I decided, or perhaps it was decided for me, to change my topic and take up again this question that had been with me for such a long time. I nceed, that fall, I immediately imagined myself as a patient in a sanatorium taking the cure, alongwith all thewonderful,witty fellows and partners with their various ailments\u2014a feeling that made perfect sense of the academy\u2019s retired location, the lake, the fresh air,theterraces,theforest, the light, the extraordinary and abundant food, the great care of the team of professionals in the house, and the beautiful pavilion in the garden by the lake that Regine Leibinger and Frank Barkow had recently completed asa kind ofsun pavilion for the cure,FiG.4 where I wrote these lines. Likewise,arriving at the Getty in the springofthataca demicyear, to a verywhite building ontop of a hill, I thought 8 3 Open air terrace for the cure, Hecke shorn pulmonary clinic, BerlinWannsee. in the 1950s 4 Barkow Leibinger architects, pavilion at the American Academy in Berlin Wannsee.2014 about it as almost like a Magic Mountain, with terraces outside every room where patients in the Getty Research Insti tutecouldtakethesunlight and aircu re and where I walked past a photograph of Sontag, who had been a fellow there, on the way to my office every day anc I waved to her as if to remind myse f how it all started. That year, the theme at the Ge:ty Research Institute was the canon of art history. There is today an ever more nuanced understanding of the canon in architecture, yet the central mythology of modern architecture remains remarkably intact after almost one hundred years\u2014perhaps because it was never true. Concealed within the standard narratives about modern architecture are other stories that have been forgotten or repressed. stories that energized and rationalized the work of the avant garde, but were pushed to the background in favor of a simplistic rhetoric oftechnical and visual efficiency. Reyner Banham, probably the first historian to challenge the mythology of modern architecture as functionalist, contrasted the way his teacher Nikolaus Pevsner could never escape the short list ofcanonical figures that he himself had canonized with Henry Russell Hitchcock's \u201cextracanonical\" vision,which picks upperipheraland unexpected figures and ideas.2 In these terms, I think of my research as \u201cintra canonical\"\u2014attentive to the unexpected within thecanon itself. And inthis case.the unexpected is disease. So what is this surprisingly resilient canonical view? Modern architecture, launched in the 1920s by an international group of avant garde architects, has usually introduction been understood in terms of functional efficiency, new materials (glass, iron, reinforced concrete), new technologies of construction, and the machine aesthetic. In contrast, the hypothesis of this book' is that modern architecture was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time\u2014 tuberculosis\u2014and the technology that became associated with it\u2014X rays. That technology produced a new and widespread change in the conception of space and the relation of inside to outside. This change can be understood as a specific historical event, a twentieth century twist in the ancient, intimate relationship between architecture and medicinethat is ongoing today. Just as medicaltechnologies and the treatment of illness played a major role in determining the characteristics of modern architecture. new medical technologies are today creating new forms of architecture as the relationship between inside and outside passes through another transformation. Yet we are still living in the architecture shaped by a specific disease,tuberculosis, and its primary diagnostic tool, the X ray. Modern architecture remains the default everyday environment, the norm produced by vast industrial systems, rather than the transgressive work of an avant garde inspired by a specific disease. It is as if the widespread success of modern architecture depended on its association with health, its internationalism the consequence of the global spread of the disease it was meantto resist. A map showing the distribution of modern architecture would echo a map of the distribution of the illness. Tuberculosis is fundamentally urban, as was modern architecture. One in seven people on the planet 10 died from it inthe nineteenth century, but in the city of Paris alone, it was close to one in three. Modernity was driven by illness.The engine of modern architecture was not a heroic, shiny, functional machine working its way acrossvthe globe, but a languid,fragile body suspended outside daily life in a protective cocoon of new technologies and geometries. It is the difficulty pf each breath and therefore' the treasure of each breath: the melancholy of modernity. Modern architecture is inseparable from an intimate, even romantic, relationship between a new kind of medical image and a new kind of space\u2014each intriguing and inspiring the other. The point here is not to pin this relationship down and ossify it, but to release it, to reactive it, to stimulate reflection by offering a kind of portrait at the intersection of biology, psychology, biography, sexuality, and technology to invite the reader to look again, to see modern architecturethrough different eyes.Whatdoes it mean when everyone\u2014the client, the architect, the theorist, the critic, the worker\u2014is a patient? 1 Some ofthe texts I published onthis theme include:\"Krankheit als Metapher inder modernen Architektur.\u2019Ooidolcs 64 (1997); \u201cThe Medical Body in Modern Architect ure,\u201c in Anybody. ed.Cynthia Davidson (Cambridge, MA; MIT Press, 1997);\"Skinless Architecture.\" n The State ofArchitecture at the Beginning of th e 21st Century; ed.

Introduction 11 CHAPTER 1 Health and Architecture: From Vitruvius to Sick Building Syndrome Architecture and medicine have always been tightly inter linked.Just asclassical theories of the Greek polis followed theories of the four humors, contemporary ideas of health organize design theories today. Architectural discourse weaves itself througl;l theories of body and brain, constructing the architect as a kind of doctor and the client as patient. Vitruvius in the first century BC launched Western architectural theory by insisting that all architects needed to study medicine: \"Healthfulness being their chief object.\"1 He devoted a large part of the first book of his Ten Books on Architecture to the question cf health, giving detailed instructions on how to determine the healthiness of a proposed site for a city by returning to the ancient method of sacrificing an animal that lives there and inspecting its liver to make sure it is \u201csound and firm.\" Likewise, for the healthy site of each building, he discusses the theory of the four humors and emphasizes the direction of the winds andthe sun. Too much ofone humor enfeebles and\"impairs the fluids of the human body.\u201d In reverse, those who are unwell can be cured more quickly through design, rebuilding the system of those \u201cexhausted by disease,\" including \"consumption\" (tuberculosis). Vitruvius discusses the internal wo rkings of the body just as much as he discusses the internal working of buildings. Theories of medicine are used as a kind of foundation for architectural theory. Architecture itself thus becomes a branch of medicine. Symptomatica Uy, Vitruvius di dnt simply import the theory of the four humors, which was treated skeptically by many 1 Measureofthehumanbody,Cesare Cesariano\u2019stranslationofVitruvius's DeArch/tectura, 1521 13 2 John Banister delivering an anatomical lecture at the Barber Surgeons\u2019 Hall, ca.1530 3 Leonardo daVinci, View of a Skull. cs.1489 4 Pietro Berrettini da Cortona.

Embryoin the Womb. ca.1510 14 7 physicians, but elaborated on it, adjusting it to develop his own architecturally based theory of health or health based theory of architecture.2 By the Renaissance, however, the central reference for architecture was flo longer the whole body, its health determined bythefour humors, but a dissected,fragmented, analyzed body. Just as Renaissance schools of medicine used casts of body parts, design schools such as the very first one, the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, founded in 1563 by Giorgio Vasari, used cast fragments of historical buildings for teaching, and anatomical dissection at the Santa Maria Nuova hospital was a central part ofthe training to which all students of Vasari's academy were required to attend and draw for days on end, even as the body putrefied and some students fell ill.3 As doctors investigated the mysterious interior of the body by cutting into and dissecting it, architects tried to understand the interior of buildings by slicing section cuts through them. In the sketchbooks of Leonardo da Vinci, cutaway views of architectural interiors appear beside anatomical drawings. He even understood the interiors of the brain and the womb in architecturalterms, asenclosuresthat must be cutthrough to revealtheir secrets. figs.3,5 Likewise, in the mid nineteenth century, Viollet le Duc illustrated his Dictionnoire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVI\" si\u00e8cle (1854 1868) with perspectival sectional cutaway drawings showing medieval buildings as if dissected. fig.7 Influenced by George Cuvier\u2019s Le\u00e7ons d'anatomie compar\u00e9e (1800 1805) fig.6 and Jean Marc Bourgery's Traite comp let de l'anatomie de 6 Lessonsofanatomyofthebaron GeorgesCuvier(1769 1832), in theJardin des Plantes of Paris. ca. 1800 7 Eug\u00e8ne VioUet le Duc.

His new mode of drawing revealed the functional roLe of each dissected fragment. His own interventions into medieval buildings were understood as surgicaL procedures, with modern iron technology used as a prosthesis.4 EXERCISING ARCHITECTURE As medicaL representations changed, so did architectural representations. In the twentieth century, the widespread use ofX rays made a new wayofthinking about architecture possible. Modern buildings even started to look like medical images, with transparent glass walls revealing the inner secrets of the structures. fig.9 Indeed, the architecture of the earLy twentieth century cannot befully understood without grasping its relationship with disease and especially withtuberculosis, a diseasefor which X rays wereby chance particuLarLy weLL adapted as a means of diagnosis and monitoring of treatment. no. 10 The symptoms, if not the principles, of modern architecture seem to have been taken straight out of a medicaL text on the disease. A year before the German microbiologist Robert Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus in 1882, \u00abe.n a standard medical book gave the cause of the disease as, among other things, lack of exercise, sedentary indoor Life, defective ventilation, deficiency of Light, and depressing emotions.5 It took a long time for these notions to lose 16 11 BERLINER KLINISCHE WOCHENSCHPJET.

Tuberculosis was thought to be a \u201cwet\" disease produced by damp cities. In an uncanny echo of Vitruvius, theTB patientwasthought toneeda new environmentto dry out the inside of their bodies. Modern architects offered health by providing exactly such a change of environment. Nineteenth century architecture was demonized as unhealthy, and sun, light, ventilation, exercise, roof terraces, hygiene, and whiteness were offeree as means to prevent, if not cure, tuberculosis. FGS,iz i4 The publicity campaign of modern architecture was organized around contemporary beliefs about tuberculosis and fears ofthe disease. In engaging TB, architects were not just tuning in to one illness among others.TheTB scarewas key in the emerging bond between the body, the military, industry, and politics. As Susan Sontag argued, few diseases have been so \u201cspectacularly, and similarly, encumbered by the trappings of metaphor\" as tuberculosis and cancer.6 ln The Human Motor; Anson Rabinbach goes as far as locatingTB as part of a complete reconceptualization of the human body? He argues that the obsession with fatigue that took over between 1895 and World War I marked rising anxiety about the industrial age. Diseases such as TB were blamed on fatigue, and exercise programs offered to combat them. Therewasa widespread call fororganized sports.Gymnastic exercises,which had been limited tothe militarythroughout the nineteenth century, were now advocated for schools. Furthermore, the military itself was reorganized on the basis of the new \u201csciences of work.\" Medicine and biology becamethe basis of politicaltheory.Through this \u201cbiologiza 18 tion of politics,\" the sciences of the body were firmly established as the basis of \u201csocial hygiene.\" By 1910, they were split into physiology and psychology, but successfully recombined as \u201cpsychotechnics\u201d during the war. On the basis ofthismilitarysi.Iccess,an amalgamation of European scientific research and US Taylorism became standard equipment of modern industrial management. The,dream of a body without fatigue finally reached its sinister peak in the dictatorial regimesofthe 1930s. We can see this trajectory in a chitecture. Architects repeatedly used disease imagery to express concern for social order. Architecture\u2019s traditional role of imposing order takes on different meanings with different diseases. The reconfiguration of the medical body by new sciences leads to a reconfiguration of architecture. Take Le Corbusier, the opening pages of Vers une architecture (1923) give his \u201cdiagnosis\" of the state of architecture, condemning the traditional house for producing the debilitating effect of tuberculosis (\u201cconsumption\"). He goes on to promote the healthy engineer over the u n healthy architect: We have become sedentary beings, that is our lot. The house eats away at us in our immobility, like consumption. We will soon need too many sanatoria.... Engineers are healthy and virile, active and useful, moral and joyful. Architects are disenchanted and idle, boastful or morose.That is becausethey will soon have nothingto do. We hove no more money to pile up historical keepsakes. We need to cleanse ourselves....

The final chapter opposes the healthy modern workplace to the u nhealthy private house: \u201cThe machine that we live in is an old coach full oftuberculosis\"9 Likeso many architects, Le Corbusier expanded the medical argument from the house to the city. In Urbamsme (1925) he opposes the fatiguing city and looks for a \u201ccure,\" concluding that \"su rgery\" is required to remove the \u201ccancer\u201d of degenerate street layouts and \u201crotten old houses full oftuberculosis\"10 In his film L'Architecture d\u2019au/ourd\u2019hui (1929), made in collaboration with the young filmmaker Pierre Chenal, Le Corbusier argues that disease breeds in cities because, in the twentieth century, people still live as if in the Middle Ages.

To reinforce the point, Le Corbusier uses pictures taken from medical texts as architectural illustrations, showing the lungs and their inner workings, Fia.20 while giving architectural illustrations medical labels, as when a photograph of an old partofthe city becomes \u201cHistoric Paris, tubercular Paris.\u201d12 fig. 9 In this book, Le Corbusier develops a concept of\u201cexact air\u201dwherebythe outdoor air is continually circulated and cleaned, made \u201cdust free, disinfected...and readyto be consumed by the lung.\u2019i3 fig.ji One by one, Le Corbusier thus presents the characteristic features of modern architecture\u2014pilotis, roof garden, glass walls, and clean air\u2014as medical devices, and theoverall effect is that of a sanatorium devoted to both preventive and reactive cure. There is no line between domestic architecture and medicine. Le Corbusier had long been obsessed with his own health. Moving in 1917 to Paris from his small hometown, La Chaux de Fonds in Switzerland, he complained about feeling exhausted allthe time until he met Dr. Pierre Winter, wio introduced him to exercise as a way of combating fatigue and stress.

Sport introduces an element of ORDER in life,14 FIGS.24,26 Winter was an enthusiast of the authoritarian wing of the syndicalist movement in France and a follower of Georges Valois (the self proclaimed French Mussolini), who founded the short lived fascist party Le Faisceau in 1925. In 1928, Winter joined the fascist revolutionary party of Philippe Lamour, made of old members of Faisceau. In a 1926 article for Valois's journal Le nouveau si\u00e8cle on Le Corbusier\u2019s plan for a new kind of city, Winter writes: \u201cOnly a strong program of urbanism\u2014the program of a Fascist government\u2014is capable of adapting the modern city to the needs of all.\u201d15 This intimate bond between architecture, urbanism, disease, war, industry, and politics is explicit throughout the work of Le Corbusier and manyof his colleagues in the interwar period. In a lengthy statement prepared to introduce Le Corbusier\u2019s lecture in L\u2019Acad\u00e9mie de la Coupole, Paris, in 1936, Winter describes \u201cLe Corbusier... the architect, the painter, the poet as inseparable from the less known Le Corbusier that I have the particular mission to L\u2019ESPRIT NOUVEAU Health and Architecture.

The modern body housed by modern architecturethus was not a single body, but a multiplicityof bodies. The body was no longer a stable point of reference around which an architecture could be built. It was a construction site. Architects such as Le Corbusier and his colleagues in the architectural avant garde actively redesigned the body with their architecture, ratherthan housingit or symbolizing it.A new spirit(/\u2019esprit nouveau) requiresa new body, as Winter writes in his article \u201cLe corps nouveau\": A truly new spirit can exist only in a new body. Instinctively, modern man knows that.... We have to realize thatthe most formidable discovery ofourtime is Health, understood in this more comprehensive sense. Physical health: the basis,of mental health, the basis of every balanced activity, of all production, in all domains, and in that of art as much as in all the others.... The body will emerge naked i n the sun. washed, muscled.su pple.1s Modern architecture likewise presented itself as lean and fit, all the excess weight of neoclassical tradition stripped off to reveal a muscular and agile body in a white sports outfit.The modern housewas understood notjustasa kind of medical equipment, a mechanismforcaringforthe body, but as a piece of exercise equipment designed to enhance it, to produce a strong and healthy body. Think of all the bodybuilding houses in modern architecture: Marcel Breuer\u2019s bedroom for Erwin Piscator in Berlin (1927) fig.26, with its gymnastic equipment, and his apartment with Gustav Has senpflugfor Hilde Levi in Berlin (1930) fig.27; Walter Gropius\u2019s gyms in his communal apartments for the Werkbund exhibition in Paris (1930) Fie.23 and for the German Building Exhibition in Berlin (1931) FiG.29; Richard Docker\u2019s rooftop gym at the Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart (1927); Theo Effenberger\u2019s roof terrace gym at the Werkbund building exhibition in Breslau (1929) ns.31; the sports room and solari umon the top ofJohannes Brinkman and Leendert Cornelis van der Vlugt\u2019s van der Leeuw house in Rotterdam (19281930).

But the body was not seen as simply physical. L'Espr/t nouveau was also obsessed with the relationship between psyc h e and body. It published articles by Dr. Allendy and his colleague Dr. Laforgue onthe relationsh ip between Freud ian psychoanalysis and French psychiatry, with titles such as \"The Conscious and the Unconscious,\" \"Neuroses,\u201d \u201cDreams,\" and \"The Oedipus Complex.\" While Le Corbusier was sometimes dismissive of psychoanalysis, he repeatedly spoke of the intimate relationship between mind and body, portraying mental stability as the product of a healthy physical environment. In Urbanisme, hearguesthatthe degeneration ofthe city leads to \u201cphysical and nervous sickness,\" and in Lo v/iie radieuse, he proposes that the new living cell be a machine for the \u201crecuperation of physical and nervous energy... the upkeep of the human machine: cleaning, drain ing the toxic substances, recuperating nervous energy, mainte nan ceor increase of physicalenergy\"!0 FiG.3*0nce again, the architectwas a doctor. practicing a form of preventive medicine that nurtures and rebuilds the body and psyche. 30 32 LeCorbusier portrayed as a biologist.

Every element of modern architecture addressed both physiological and mental sickness. Le Corbusier saw ttie smooth, white surfaces he was strongly advocating with his architecture not just as hygienic, a way to prevent the spread of germs,..but as 3n anesthetic to calm \u201cthe nerves shattered fn the aftermath of war,\" at the same time that actual anesthetics (cocaine) were being\u201cpeddled\" in the street of Paris, as he noted.21 Cocaine was one of the first substances used as anesthetic for surgery by Karl Koller (on the recommendation of Freud) in 1884. fig.3s Anesthesia is the removal of feeling, the te mporal suppression of the central nervous system in order to achieve lack of sensation, and by minimizing friction, the smooth surfaces of modern architecture anesthetize bodily sensation. Smooth white planes restore the \"calm\" that preceded the brutality of the arrival of the mass produced ornaments of modern industry Le Corbusier repeatedly uses the word \u201ccalm\" as an ideal, as if the purpose of design was stress reduction. For him, even the touch of the modern object becomes a reassuring visual effect: \u201cOur hand reaches out to it [the modern object) and our sense of touch looks in its own wayas ourfingers close around it.\"22 The shock of war, the shock of the machine age, the shock of the metropolis have in common anesthesia, the temporary removal of feeling, whether physical or psychological. In \u201cExperience and Poverty\" (1933) Walter Benjamin wrote about people returning from World War I \u201cpoorer in Health and Architecture: From Vitruvius to Sick Building Syndrome experience,\u201d unable to communicate, siLent, in shock after feeling the fuLl force of modern technology: \u201cA generation that had gone to schooL in horse drawn streetcars now stood in the open air, amid a Landscape in which nothing was the same except the clouds, and, at its center, in a force fieLd of destructive torrents and exp.osions, the tiny, fragile human body.\"52 Until the nineteenth century, aesthetics, from the Greek, had n ot hing to do with the intelLect or the ideal and everyth ing to do with sensation, with perception by bodily feeling.24 But now, feeLing was no longe r possibLe. Humanswere anesthetized by the shock,yet sou ght further anesthetics.

The smiLe \u201cfunctions as mi metic shock absorber.\u201c25 Modern design is likewise a shock absorber, its frozen smile barely hiding the terror it tries to cover over. Benjamin\u2019s understanding of modern experience is neurological, as Susan Buck Morss has written.26 \"The shock expe rience which the passer by has in the crowd corresponds to what the worker \u2018experiences' at his machine.\u201c27 War. machine. and metropoLis are all shock environments. conditions of danger where one has to be able to react quickly to protect oneseLf from sudden, unforeseeable threats. Nerves are on the periphery. The elimination of ornament is not simply an aesthetic choice, but a neurological or even narcotic one. Adolf Loos argued that we moderns no Longer have the nerves necessary to eat, dress, and decorate as in previous centuries. In \"Ornament and Crime,\" he speaks of his \"horror\" in front of the decorated animaLs in culinary dispLays, particularLy if he thinks he has to eat \u201cone of these stuffed animal corpses. I only eat roast beef!\" Hefeelsthe same nausea inthefaceof any excessive ornament, whether on food or architecture: \u201cWe Lack the steady nerves to drink from an eLephant's ivory tuskon which an Amazon battle scene has bee n engraved....

In \u201cKarl Kraus,\" Walter Benjamin quotes Robert Scheu, brother ofGustavScheu (for whomAdolfLoos built a controversial house in Vienna in 1912): \u201cKraus discovered a great subject that had never before set in motion the pen ofa journalist: the rights of the nerves.... He became the advocate of the nerves... but the subject grew under his hands, to become the problem of private life.\"29 Private life, the interior, becomes newly fragile, like that of the nervous i ndi vidual analyzed by psychoanalysis or the vulnerable body of the tuberculosis patient penetrated by X rays. Everybody becomes like a child or a patient needing to be wrapped ir soft lining. fig.4\u00bb It is as if the new nerves are so new that the modern individual has only just been born and needs a protective incubator to survive, to gain the necessary strength. Loos's architecture is such an incubator. Loos was himself fragile. He suffered from numerous nervous and physical ailments throughout his life. He contracted syphilis as a young man, and it left him sterile. He had stomach cancer and underwent a number of major surgeries. figjs All his life he suffered from poor hearing, and he eventually became completely deaf. At the end of h s life, he checked himself into the sanatorium run by his friend. the neurologist Dr. Norbert Schwarzmann, in Kalksburg, where he died in 1933. Ayear earlier, Buckminster Fuller had included \u201cnerve shock proofing\" in his list of basic requirements for all houses.80 Frederick Kiesler and Richard 36 41 Frederick Kiesler, ContemporOry Art Applied to the Store ond Its D/sploy, 1930.cover Neutra would develop entiretheories of design based onthe nerves. It is as if nerves themselves were the true clients of modern architecture. Modern architecture was not just a form of medical equipment or an exercise machine. It also was a cocoon for shelteringthefragile psychetraumatized byexposu re to war, loss of stable borders, and..he new rhythms and,speeds of modern industrialized technology. Every room became a recovery room, every building a trauma center. Architecture became a psychological craft. \u201cPSYCHO FUNCTION,\u201d OR ARCHITECTURE AS EATING DISORDER \u00ab Take, for example, the extraordinary concept of \"psychofunction\u201d that Friedrich Kiesler introduced in his 1930 book Contemporary Art Applied to the Store and Its Display: fig.41 \u201cThe \u2018psycho functional\u2019 influence is exhibited not only in lines, planes and form, but also in materials and colors. Glass has a different psychological effect from leather, wood from metal. The same applies, of course, to color schemes. Function and efficiency alone cannot create art works. \u2018Psycho function' is that 'surplus\u2019 above efficiency which may turn a functional solution into art.\"31 Kiesler continues the argument in the later essay \"Pseudo Functionalism in Modern Architecture\u201d:\"We muststrivefromthe outset to satisfy the psyche ofthe dweller. \"31 The house, he says, is a human body, \"a living organism with the reactivity of a full blooded creature,\u201d with organs (the stairs are the feet, the ventilation system is the nose, and so on), a nervous Health and Architecture: From Vitruvius to Sick Building Syndrome 37 system, and a digestive system that can \u201csuffer from constipation\u201d33 More than that, he insists, the house, like man, lives \u201cin emotions and dreams through the medium of his physique.\u201d The psyche cannot be separated from the body. Indeed, the house is the product of \u201cthe erotic and creative insti nct,\u201d and our experience of it is erotic3' In the press release for the 1969 exhibition of Ga/ax/es at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York, Kiesler claims to have \u201cdiscovered architecture\u201d when, at the age of three, he crept under the \u201cvolum inouspeasant ski rts of his Ukrain ian nanny and struck a match.\" Architecture for him is always erotic. Of his Endless House, fiss.42,43 he writes: \"There is no beginning and no end to it,likethe human body....The\u2018End less' is rather sensuous, more like the female body in contrast to sharp angled male architecture.\u201d35 The building is meantto produce a kind of high\u2014in 1961, he likened the experience of the Endless House to that of smoking marijuana. In the course of an interview, he was asked: \u201cWhat do you think would happen if architects generally became interested in whatyou have done and inyour approach? Isn't it a terribly dangerous, undisciplined sort of architecture for most people?\u201d To which he responded: \"I can assure you, it will be like giving them marijuana, architecturally speaking.\u201d36 For him, the occupant of modern architecture yearns to bespaced out. In 1947 Kiesler generated the first version of his Endless House. The house was not just one project among others. It was his whole life\u2014his philosophy and even his body. He built it, literally, from the inside and saw himself 38 42,43 Frederick Kiester, Endless House. interior models, 1960 Health and Archilecture: From Vitruvius to Sick Building Syndrome 39 being swallowed by it. The house was like a stomach, fu U of folds, absorbing juices and nutrients. The occupant thus becomes a kind of food. In anextraordinary confusion of his own body with architecture, he described modern architecture as architecture on a diet inthe aftermath of World War I: We had nothing to eat. I recall very well my own situation: after the war I lived on the dole for many years; I got about seven Kronen a week, which would be the equivalent of seven dollars per week now. But one could live on that monastically; I had rice, chiefly, and mushrooms. I remember only too well the mushrooms which I dried and reheated again just as I did with tea leaves. As in our living habits, we started to clean off everything that was surplus in design\u2014ornamentation, certain luxurious materials, moldings, this and that. Everythi ngbecame, over the years, sim pler, cleaner, whiter, and... you know, what we call functionalism was on its natural way. So functionalism was really a reaction to the overstuffing of the Victorian age. Architecture had to be put on a diet. And the rectangular style did it. Now the period of diet is over and we caneatnormallyagain. However that does not mean that we should overeat, stuff ourselves with whipped cream, ice cream\u2014or with architecture either.37 Modern architecture is an eating disorder. The result was what Kiesler called \"the rectangular style;\u2019 the skin and 44 Frederick Kiesler, Endless Theater, foor plan. Venna.1924 1925 45 Frederick Kiesler. Space Stage, International Exhibition of New Theater Techniques.Vienne, 1924 46 Frederick Kiesler. Endless^^ofer, longitudinal section, Vien na, 1924 1925 bones architecture of the modern period. For him, a weLL baLanced diet meant his Endless House: the elimination of any constipating residue. Everything in the Endless House is skin. The skin is the structure, as in an egg. Kiesler claimed to have worked on this idea for a long time. In fact, he insisted that he worked on just one idea throughout his life. Hetraced it back to his Space Theater of 1923, FGs.\u00ab 46 his \u201cfirst Endless.\" When he came to the United States in 1926, he said, he carried the Endless with him, but no one understood it. The organizers of the International Style exhibition of 1932 at MoMA reviewed his work when they were preparing the exhibition. This is how Kiesler recalls their meeting: Health and Architecture: From Vitruvius to Sick Bui ldingSyndrome 41 Philip Johnson came with Henry Russell Hitchcockto see plans of my work.Among our friends of the De Stijl group it was known that I have deviated from the \u201cquadrat,\" but van Doesburg stood by enthusiastically, as did Mondrian. The others were doubtful; Mies was neutral and reserved. I was terribly poor.... Here were the plansfor a buildingthat looked like an egg, not Like the customary box. It wasn\u2019t square, it wasn\u2019t in steel, it wasn\u2019t in glass, it wasn\u2019t in aluminum, it was absolutely outside the mode ofthe International Style.39 47 Frederick Kiesler withhis model of the Endless House.

Apparently he survived thanks to a coffee shop owner on Sixth Avenue who fed him and his wife Stefi Frischer every da. When he was finally thrown out of his apartment because he could not paythe rent, hewas let in every day bythe doorman whilethe new tenants were out so hecould use the drafting table, which had been confiscated by the landlord, to work on his project for the shop windows of Saks Fifth Avenue. Inside the Endless House describes his inability to afford even basic expenses in terms of the same emaciated body that he identifies with modern architecture: \u201cAll in all, I'm down at the bottom and have practically nothing left: these expenses are the bone structure, and there is no hope for either skin or flesh with which to cover the skeleton.\"33 Just as Le Corbusier\u2019s idea about health and architecture started with his obsessions about his own body, Kieslers physical condition organized his theories and designs. He could not separate himself from his architec 42 \u00ab 50 ture. Not by chance, he always photographed his own body insidethe bodyofthe building. pigs.4?,4s With his fragile frame inside the egg, it is as if the house became his surrogate body. He replaced the heroic, athletic, muscular body of modern architecture w,ith a. frail body in need of protection by architecture. Architecture here becomes an infinite, uterine cave, nurturing a kind oUranslucent body so tpat the brain can thrive and feel.The bodyfor Kiesler quivers, sheltered ina kind ofspiral, not in orderto be disconnected from the world, buton the contrary, in order to connect itself to the world. The polemical sensuality of Kiesler\u2019s designs extends the nerves from the psyche through the tactile to the cosmic. A series of sketches make this point. In one, the interaction of the nervous system with a chair becomes part of a multisensual engagement with the world. In another, the chair becomes partofan interior, and the human is described as \"a terrestrial spectra,\" the environment as a \u201cstellar spectra (with the objectstaking the place of stars).\" figs. 49,so Space for Kiesler is always outer space. Everything in his architecture floats. The floors go up and down, the structure hangs, and even the furniture, the cabinets, the tables, the lighting fixtures are suspended in a Surrealist project that begins with the thought ofthe body as a kind of house and of the house as a body. It is not by chance that his memoirs are entitled Inside the Endless House. fig.sz Psyche, sexuality, the body, and architecture are inseparable. Indeed, in Inside the Endless House Kiesler refers to \u201cthe house of the human body.\" The book is a kind of diary Health and Architecture: From Vitruvius to Sick Building Syndrome 43 (covering the years 1956 to 1964) that revolves around the condition of thearchitect's body. Itis filled with referencesto his medical problems, from rheumatism to asthma, allergies, colds, and fevers. Much of it involves eating, or the desire to eat. Detailed descriptions of numerous meals are preceded by comments such as \u201ca hunger rose from my stomach incessantly\" or \u201cMy solar plexus signaled hunger. And starved I was.\" Even a client's final agreement to commission Kiesler is interrupted by the stomach: \u201cI was desperately hu ngry....I ate a naked pieceof meat.\"40 The modern subject is like thefirst humans survivingin their caves after the occasional hunt. Le Corbusier\u2019s fatigue and Kiesler\u2019s malnourishment completely organized their thinking about architecture. Their rhetoric of the healthy and health inducing building is underpinned by the actual experience of sick bodies. The wasting away of the body became the countermodel for a healthy architecture. But their therapeutic proposals are very different, as is clear in a section of Inside the Endless House entitled \u201cThe Correalism of the Plastic Arts\": \u201cnobody has ever defined the meaning of the roots of function; it has notbeen recognized that anyfunction is subject toevolution just as man is. Function is now frozen in hygiene, light and air conditioning\"41 Kiesler dismisses the aesthetic of sun, air, and hygiene as a \u201cmagic fake of pseudo functionalism\" that is \u201cvomiting its indigestion.\"42 Modern architecture is not as healthy as it looks. inside the Endless House suggests that healthy architecture has to avoid threats like the \u201ccancerous growth of ducts\"43 imposed on all building types by 44 engineers and the filling of basements with the \u201cexcrement from the digestion of our house life.\"44 a whole different attitude toward the body of the building is required. For Kiesler, the healthy body is first and foremost the sensual body. lndeed,,sensual pleasure is the organizing principle of his work. At one point, he describes the model of the Endless House as \"rolled up like a sex kitte)l.\" The architect\u2019s primary role isto satisfy appetites, whether sexual or gastric: \u201cfart could be accepted like sex and sex like eating, men and women would not feel like perverts, shamelessly obscene in the presence of modern art or architecture.\"45 For Kiesler, the International Style is filled with disorders and repressions. Unblocking architecture in the name of pleasure does not mean abandoning the medical body. On the contrary. Kiesler\u2019s twisted forms are meant to be healthier than Le Corbusier\u2019s \u201cmachine a habiter.\" Dissidents such as Kieslerexpose that modern architecture is an always failed attempt to repress its own sensuality and like every person is full of secrets, obsessions, and forbidden pleasures hidden behind its attempts to project the image ofa new normality.

Many of these ideas came from the late nineteenth century Lebensreform movement in Germany, fig.56 which advocated a back to nature lifestyle of fresh air, gardening. health food, alternative medic ine, nudism,sexual liberation, and the avoidance of alcohol, tobacco, and vaccines.

He wrote a colum n for the Los Angeles Times entitled \u201cCare of the Body.\" The publisher of the newspaper, Harry Chandler, was one of his patients. The Lovell Houses of Schindler and Neutra were organized around his full regime of sun, air, exercise, fasting, and dietstrategies. The Health House of Neutra, in particular, became a public cemonstration of Lovell\u2019s theories, with en suite sleeping porches outside every room, \"nude sunbathing opportuni t es\u201dth roughout the house, and \u201chydrotherapy equipment\u201d 48 60 and \u201cmarathonshowers\"inthe master bathroom, which was also equipped with a \u201cbuilt in enema fixture with various douches and nozzles devices,thermostatically controlled.\u201d47 Lovell opened the house to the public for two weekends, announcingit' in his Los Angeles Times column, which included photographs, a description of the house, and a map showing howto get there. Fie.oi.Arou nd fifteen thousand people showed up, and Neutra himself gave the tours. fig.\u00ab3 Two photographs of the \u201cHouse of Health\" appear in this column alongside ads for treating \u201csagging flabby chins,\u201d \u201cpelvic troubles: men and women;\u2019 \u201csevere cases of chronic constipation;\u2019 \u201cProstate troubles;\u2019 and \u201ceczema;\u20194\u00ae a testament to the increasing preoccupation of Americans with the physical appearance and performance of their bodies. Lovell saw in modern architecture a model for health, a mechanism for reconstructing the human:\u201cWhen we learn to build our bodies with the same careful precision and the same scientific accuracy with which the modern builder constructs his houses\u201d we finally will become healthy.49 Neutra, on the other hand, saw architecture as a \u201cbranch of preventive medicine.\u201d lnfluenced by Lovell\u2019s theories of drugless health, he was proud of resisting what he called the \u201cdrugs of ornamentation\" inthe designof the house, avoiding the \u201ccorpulent excesses of ornament and curvature.\u201d50 Neutra had his own theories about the relationship between health and architecture and wrote extensively about it. In Survival through Design (1954), fb.6i for example, he argues that theverysurvival of the human species depends on having designers focus on \u201cphysiological space.\u201d Design, for Health and Architecture:FromVitruvius toSick Building Syndrome 49 62 An out of doors. yel Inclosed area, b a ficlmUssoi prvpcr vrttb provision tec their carpenter work, clay modeling and other hand tools Time are tacUltlci tor swimming, basketball, handball and.

Neutra thought his buildings could improve not just the health, Out also the sex lives of their inhabitants. The desire for self improvement in every aspect of one\u2019s life resonated with Californians who.had become increasingly concerned with. their bodies' appearance and performance.51 Exercise, bodybuilding, dieting, therapy, surgery, and cosmetics became a major part of a continuous se f construction. Already by midcentury, the preoccupation had extended to mental health. As tu berculosis became controlled w th antibiotics, particularly streptomycin (the first antibiotic cure for tuberculosis, discovered in 1943), Neutra switched his idea of the architect as a doctorto the idea of the architect as a kind of psychoanalyst. The function of the house was to provide not just physical health, but also psychological well being. Many clients of Neutra talked to him about their \u201cnervous\" problems, their marital problems, their fertility problems. In fact, his theory of architecture was ultimately a theory about the nerves, the intersection of body and brain. A symptomatic figure was Wilhelm Reich, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Freud who deviated from his theories, was expelled from psychoanalytic circles, and settled in America in 1939. He was the inventor of the \u201corgone energy accumulator,\" popularized as an \u201corgasm machine\" in films such as Woody Allen\u2019s Sleeper (1973) and Roger Vadim's Barbarella (1968). \u00ab2 PhilipM.Loveutcareofthe Body,\u201d Several clients of Neutra werefollowers of Reich, especially ^p^StoteL^vell Josephine and Robert Chuey,whocommissioned a house by House, LosAngeies, 1927 192L Health and Architecture: From Vitruvius toSick Building Syndrome 51 65 him that became a salon for orgone users and early experi mentswith LSD.52fig.64 Reich thought the libido is affected by physical space and\u2014unlike Freud, who saw sexual dysfunction as a symptom of neurosis\u2014Reich thought it is the cause of the neurosis and sought to alleviate it with \u201corgone,\" a previously unaccounted for form of energy His \u201corgone energy accumulator\" fig.ss was a primitive box the size of a telephone booth, composed of up to twenty layers of organic and nonorganic materials, that was supposed to accumulate the energy and transmit it to the body inside it. Reich wrote about the need for regular, daily sessions in the machineand claimed it could cure anything from headaches to chronic fatigue, arthritis, heart disease, cancer, brain tumors, and impotence.The orgone accumulator became best known as a machine to increase sexual performance, orwhat Reich called \u201corgastic potency,\u201d a complete release of energy that could be measured as an electrical discharge. Several clients of Neutra had accumulators in their houses. More important, Neutra thought of the house itself as a kind of orgone accumulator, a machine not just for health, but also for desire\u2014or rather, desireas health. 64 Richard Neutra, Chuey House, Los Angeles, 1956 65 Wilhelm Reich, Orgone Energy Accumulator 66 Charles and RayEames, wartime splint made of molded plywood, 1943 67 Charles and RayEames,mass production of plywood leg splints, 1943 SHOCKABSORBER The bond between design, medicine. war, and psychology keeps runningthrough architectural discourse into the second half of the century. Charles and Ray Eames\u2019s famous designs of the 1940s and 1950s, for example, are usually understood as reacting against the cold materials and 52 austere forms of 1920s and 1930s furniture design, which looked like doctor\u2019s equipment, and as expressing a new concern for the body, for natural materials, and for organic forms. But there is nothing \u201cnatural\" about them. In fact, the EameseS\u2019 plywood, furniture and toys are the result of medicaland military research. During World War II, ChaRes and Ray Eames hadJormed a company with John Entenza to mass produce plywood war products with military funding. In 1941 and 1942, they developed a molded plywood splint for the US Navy to replace a metal leg splint that did not sufficiently secure the leg and even led to gangrene and death. By the war's end, morethan one hundred and fifty thousand Eames splints had been shipped to the navy. FIGs.ss,s7 The splint performed very well in the field and was praised for its lifesaving features. In addition, the company designed and developed a plywood body litter and an arm splint, molded plywood aircraft parts, and more. By1945,the Eameses were producing molded plywood chairs with the technology they had developed for the military. A photograph ofthe plywood lounge chairof 1946 shows Charles Eames reclining on it, the position of his leg sticking straight out indicating that he had not forgotten where the idea came from. In addition,the Eameses produced molded plywood children\u2019s furniture, molded plywood animals, lightweight plywood cabinets, and even plywood Christmas decorations made out of leftover splints. Military and medical equipmenthad become the basisofdomestic equipment. For the Eameses, as for Le Corbusier, the designer is a su rgeon. I n the course of an interview, Charles Eames said: Health and Architecture: From VitruviustoSick Bui ldingSyndrome 53 \u201cThe preoccupation with self expression is no more appropriate to the world of art than it is to the world of surgery. That does not mean I would reduce self expression to zero; I am sure that really great surgeons operate on the edge of intuition. Butthe rigorous constraints in surgery\u2014those are important in any art.\u201d53 Yet the Eameses\u2019orthopedic body is not Le Corbusier\u2019s tuberculoid body or Kiesler\u2019s emaciated body.At any one time there was more than one such theory at the intersection of medicine and architecture. Architectural discourse is shaped by a continuous debate and tension between alternative medical scenarios. After World War II, Charles and Ray Eames defined the house itself as a \u201cshock absorber.\" \u201cThe house must make no insistent demands for itself, but rather aid as a background for life in work... [and] acts as re orientor and \u2018shock absorber.\"\u201954 But what is this shock? The shock in the postwar years was the shock of nuclear annihilation. FIGS. 6B,B9 Domestic life could no longer betaken for granted. It became an art form carefully constructed and marketed by a whole new industry: a form of art therapy for a trau ma tized nation, a reassuring image of the \u201cgood life\u201d to be bought like any other product.The interior becomes a showroom full of objects. fig.70 Shock is presumably absorbed through the consumption of design. \u201cGood design\" offers a \u201cgood life;\u2019 a galaxy of happy, self contained objects for people who do not feel safely contained and cannot be sure of life itself. The Eameses perfected the \u201ckeep smiling\u201d strategy that Benjamin had observed after World War I. Perhaps no 54 other designers can be seen smiling so often and so polemically. fig.71 While the ever scowling Adolf Loos had insisted in \u201cOrnament and Crime\u201d that the craftsman is \"so healthy he cannot invent ornament,\u201d the ever beaming Eameses. the poster children of good design, encouraged the postwar consumer to keep clinging to smooth design as if to a psychological liferaft. The real fu.nction ofgood design regained anesthetic,a symptom of atraumathatcannot be expressed, a smooth line ofdefense. If architectural discourse has from its beginning associated building and body, the body that it describes is the medical body, reco nstructed by each new theory of health. Throughout the twentieth century, designers positioned architecture against medical and psychological trauma. Each new instrument of medical diagnosis implied new positions for design and new systems of architectural representation. The occupant is a patient, with modernity itself being both a disease and a possible cure.

Tuberculosis helped make modern architecture modern. It is not that modern architects made modern sanatoriums. ARKIT. ALVAR'M'l'fOTO noiseless wash basin Tuberculosis 63 7 Alvar Aalto.

Aalto was a neoclassical architect before his \u201cconversion to functional ism\u201cinthe 1927 competition entry for a tuberculosis sanatorium at Kinkomaa, Finland\u2014an unrealized project of horizontal lines arid wide terraces for the cure that anticipates Paimio.5ne.7 For Aalto, the sanatorium was not architecture jn the service of medicine, but integral to medicine as such\u2014an apparatus devised asa meansoftreatment: The main purpose of the building is to function as a medical instrument.... The room design is determined by the depleted strength of the patient, reclining in his bed. The colour of the ceiling is chosen for quietness, the lightsourcesare outsideofthe patient\u2019s field of vision, the heating is oriented towards the patient's feet, and the water runs soundlessly from the taps to make sure that no patient disturbs his neighbour.8 fig.h Aalto himself had been sick at the time of the competition for the building and claimed that havingto lie in bed for an extended period oftime had been crucialto his understanding of the problem.Architecture always had been conceived forthevertical person, but here was a client permanently in the horizontal. The whole design of the room and the building had to change accordingly. Light fixtures could not remain in the ceiling, irritating the eyes of the occupant lying in bed, for Tuberculosis 65 n Orawing byAlvarAalto of an ordinary room for a\"vertical person\"anda room in Paimiofor a \u2018horizontal person\"to illustrate his 1940 article Ihe Humanizing of Architecture,\" November 1940 66 whom the ceiLing had all of a sudden acquired maximum importance\u2014a new kind of facade, one couLd say. The view through the window to the forest outside also had to be calculated from the point of view of the bed. In the terrace, the low parapet and tjiin rail above allowed the eye of the horizontal personto travel far above the forest. Even when in movement, the patient oftenvemained horizontal iria sanatorium. ELevators encased in transparent gLass, placed at the end of the corridor to avoid disturbing patients in the rooms, allowed the traveling patient. in a bed on wheeLs, a horizontal cross section view of the architecture and the landscape beyond.

Furthermore, conventional hospital rooms are never designed for constant bed ridden patients. The contrasts in color and mass between vertical walls and horizontal ceilings resulting from both natural and artificial light are not particularly well suited for patients who are especially sensitive because oftheir illness....Atuber eulosis sanatorium is, to all ntents and purposes, a house with open windows.\u00aeFies. 14,15 Architecture was not only part of the treatment, it had to address the patient's way of life. Living in a sanatorium for long periods makes it home.The hospital had to be thought as a new kind of house. And in reverse, the generic house needed to be a sanatorium. Aalto later wrote: I was able to discover that special physical and psychological reactions by patients provide good poi nters of ordinary housing. If we proceed from technical func tionalism,we shalldiscoverthata great many things in our present architecture are unfunctional from the point of view of psychology, or a combination of psy chologyand physiology. To examine how human beings react toforms and constructions, it is useful to use for experimentation especially sensitive persons, such as patients inasanatorium.i\u00b0 Tuberculosis 69 16 The bodily and psychological sensitivity of the sick person was used to recalibrate architecture. Even the specialized furniture became ordinary everyday pieces. If the cantilevered birch wood Paimio chair, for example, was designed to open the chest of the patient, allowing him or her to breathe easier, soon enough, that chair became everybody's chair. Likewise with the rest ofthe furniturespecially designed for Paimio: \u201cThe sanatorium needed furniture which should be light,flexible, easy to clean and so on.After extensive experimentation in wood, the flexible system was discovered.. to produce furniture which was more suitable for the long and painful life in a sanatonum.\u201c11 A workshop was set up with a local company to carry outthe first experiments, and in 1935, barelytwoyears after completing Paimio,Alvar and Aino Aalto founded the Finnish furniture company Artek, fig.17 with \u201cthe ambition to support and nourish human beings\u2019 physical and psychological wellbeing\u201ci ht is not by chance that theofficial time line of thecompanystarts with Paimio Sanatorium, since it is there where the first experiments in modern furniture by the Aaltos took place. The Aaltothat became known as one ofthe so called masters of modern architecture did so byengaging with disease. Aalto designs, after Paimio, had the aura of health, The reference pointwasthe seriously ill.Aalto claimed that the architect had to design for the person in the \"weakest position\" The tuberculosis patient becomes the model for modern architecture. In other words, sickness was no longer seen as the exception, butasthe norm\u2014and varying degrees of sickness were seen to define the human condi 70 16 Paimio Sanatorium lounge recreation room with Paimio chairs. 1933 17 TheArtekstore in Helsinki.1939 is Engraving after a drawing byRobert Koch of fresh bacilli from the lungs of a tuberculosis patient. asseen under the microsope i9 Engraving after a drawing by Robert Koch of tuberculosis bacilli, after two weeksgrowth under a culture, as seen under the microscope tion. The modern subject has multiple ailments, physical and psychological, and architecture is a protective cocoon not just against the weather and other outside threats, but in modernity, more notably against internal threats: psychological and bodily ailments.. Symptomatically, Aalto compared his experiments in Paimio andtheirapplication to everyday useto the\u201cexagger ated\u2019forms ofanalysis thatscientists use \u201cinorderto obtain clear more visible results,\" such as \u201cstained bacteria\" for microscope examination^3 He saw design as a form of medical research, with the sanatorium acting as a kind of research lab for modern architecture\u2014a way of testing architecture, looking more closely, in a rigorous examination, and experimenting looking at what has been hidden, exposingthe invisible forces. THE INVISIBLE CLIENT Sigmund Freud, the X ray, bacteriology, and the germ theory of disease all emerged in the same short period of time, and they are all about looking inside, acknowledging the invisible: the unconscious, the skeleton, the microelement of bacteria and the bacillus of TB. Architecture, likewise, turns itself inside out: the threat is no longer outside, but inside, in the \u201cinvisible.\u2019The micro scaleofbacteria becomes the base for furniture, rooms, houses, and cities: the micro and the macro; the bacterium and the city.

Architecture itself became bacterial. As Le Corbusier put it: We need a diagnosis and a line of conduct. In 1922 I tried todelve into an analysis, I did some laboratory work. Isolating my microbe. I watched it develop. The biology of my microbe appeared in indisputable clarity. Certitudes acquired; diagnosis. Then, by an effort of synthesis, I drew up the fundamental principies of modern city planning.14 Microbes were both the literal and metaphorical basis of a new architecture and urbanism. Modern architecture paradoxically had to represent this new invisible order with bright, transparent images, seen as clean,clear, and healthy in a kind of visual hygiene. The whiteness of modern architecture is unambiguouslythat ofthe hospital, surfaces that, as itwere, demonstrate theircleanliness. The history of modern architecture is full of sanatoriums: Josef Hoffmann\u2019s Purkersdorf outside Vienna (1903) F(G_2o; Otto Wagner's Steinhof, Vienna (1907) and project for Palmschoss heliotherapy center in the mountains near Brixen in Italy (1914) FiG.22; the Queen Alexandra Sanatorium in Davos (1907) FiG.21, bythe architects Otto Pfleghard and Max Haefeli and engineer Robert Maillart; Jan Duiker and Bernard Bijvoet\u2019s Zonnestraal in Hilversum (1925 1928) FiG.23; Richard Docker's sanatorium in Waiblingen (19261928) fiG.24; Werner Hebebrand and Willi Kleinertz's Sonnen Tuberculosis 73 25 Pablo Zabalo, Sanatorio deLeza.

Many modern architects did a sanatorium at some point, and often it defined them. The sanatorium was the testing ground of new materials and tech n ques of construction and often involved experimental collaborations between architects, engineers, and doctors. The sanatorium buildings were typically disconnected from cities. floating like ships on mountainsides, in forests. by lakes, or at the coast, with their row upon row of sun terraces treated like little beaches\u2014sometimes linked to artificial beaches on the inside of the building or to real beaches on the outside. FIGs.30,31 This sense of floating outside its normal urban habitat and angling itselfto the sun to heal fragile bodies challenged thedefinition of architecture. It is as if architecture itself took the cure. In fact, the sanatorium modernized architecture. It is not a traditional building with balconies added to it to catch the sun, but a set of deep sun terraces understood as the crucial medical instrument to be propped up and serviced by a transformed building. The whole building ultimately adjusted itself into a solar device, sometimes stacking itself at a steep angle, as with Marcel Breuer and Gustav Hassenpflug\u2019s 1930 project for a 1100 bed 74 Tuberculosis 75 76 29 Jaromir Krejcar, Machn\u00e2C, sanatorium in TrenCianskeTepll ce, 1929 1932 30 Artificial beach,Aix Les Bains 31 G.

Even the beds were suspended in metal frames that enabled themtobe rotated upto asteep angleto be aligned with the instruments. fig.3s The sanatorium had from the beginning been a laboratory for incubating new attitudes toward form, spatial organization, interior design, furniture, fittings, lighting, plumbing, air, equipment, surfaces, colors, materials, and construction methods. Take Josef Hoffmann\u2019s Purkersdorf, with its purified white surfaces, radically sharp lines, cubic furniture, Hennebique construction in reinforced concrete and iron, and use of glass and electricity, all considered part of the hygienic program. Even its gridded ferroconcrete ceiling structure was exposed and painted white.14 fig.\u00ab Not only was electricity considered more hygienic than gas as a means of illumination, ostentatiously displayed with visible cables, but it was also used for all kinds of experimental therapies, including electric massage machines, 78 36 Nicola Visontai, project for a sanatorium in the Italian Alps, 1934 37 Marcel Breuer and Gustav Hassenpflug. project for a 1100 bed sanatorium. 1930 36 Dr. Richard von KraffL Ebingand his wife.

At the time that the Pu rkersdorf was built, critic Ludwig Hevesi described it as\u201cthe naked Hoffmann building;\u2019 whose walls were lined with white porcelain tiles\u2014 \u201ca white painted or white tiled 'washable world..'\"16 Hevesi was so enthusiastic as to check himself into the sanatorium to test personally some of its therapeutic devices in the \u201cmechano therapy room\": in \u201cthis elegant white hall, full of artificial devices, with which I rapidly made closer acquaintance, [including) the electric mB.ssage machines\u2014everything is electric.\u201d^ ns.\u00ab Electricity itself was understood as a medical instrument. The building, commissioned by the industrialist Viktor Zuckerkandl, was constructed as an addition to an earlier sanatorium complex founded by neuropsychiatrist Dr. Richard von Krafft Ebing figs\u2014who died before the Pu rkersdorf was completed\u2014but it was influenced by his theories. Krafft Ebing had argued that the modern metropolis was damaging the nerves of its inhabitants and that air, light, nature, and simplicity were the most effective therapy. In 1885, he wrote Ober gesunde und kranke Nerven (On healthy and sick nerves) fis.39 and a year later Psychopathic Sexuafe He coined the term \u201cmasochism\" (after the author Leopold von Sacher Masoch) and popularized the term \u201csadism\u201d Here, once again, health was understood in psychosexual and architecturalterms. The Purkersdorf was frequented by a notable circle of patients including Gustav Mahler,Arnold Schoenberg, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Koloman Moser, who had designed Tuberculosis 79 41 :he furniture. fig.42 Even the architect of the building, Josef loffmann, checked himself in now and then. He had suffered from and was treated for a \"nervous disorder\" prior :o thecommission of the'Purkersdorf and was sympathetic to Krafft Ebing's ideas. Accordingto Eduard Sekler, that was why Hoffmann was inclined to accept thecommission.,BThe Purkersdorf accepted patients with a wide range of medical conditions including \"nervous\" disorders, neurasthenia, eating disorders, substance abuse, and hysteria. The sanatorium had become a new kind of social space for the Viennese upper classes. Hospitals until the end of the nineteenth century were almost without exception for the poor. Members of the upper and middle class were treated at home, and hospitals were seen as abject placesforthe destitute.19 But starting in the 1880s, the aristocracy and upper classes began to spend summers in sanator urns and curative spas, largely to deal with nervous disorders and other illnesses of modernity. Bertha Zuckerkandl,20 journalist and art critic of the Wiener Allgemeine Ze/tung, characterized the Purkersdorf as a \"cross between a modern hotel and a modern therapeutic centre.\"2\u2019 And Karl Kraus described it as a \"healing swindle institution\" (Heilschwinde/onstolt)\u201c figs.4o,si Critics hailed the building as one of clarity and truth. The success of the institution owed enormously to the modernity of the architecture. \"Modern\" was becoming a new and sophisticated taste among the bourgeoisie and the intelligentsia, who were supposed to dine around a single white table at the Purkersdorf fig.u (as a kind of talking cure), sleep in spartan white rooms, Fio,*e and subject them 80 40 Karl Kraus. Die Pocket 1.1899 41 Karl Kraus. 1908 42 Koloman Moser, 1903 selves to regimes of treatment in white spaces. The association of cubic white for ms with mental and physical heaLth was already strong enough for architecture to act as an effective placebo. The idea had made its way into literature. Thomas Mann\u2019s short novel Tristan, written in 1903, the sameyear as the construction of the Purkersdorf, is set in an imaginary sanatorium, the Einfried, \"a long, white, rectilinear buiLding,\u201d \"warmLy recommended for lung patients,\u201d but also \u201cfor patients of aLL sorts\": \u201csufferers of gastric disorders... people with defective hearts, paralytics, rheumatics, nervous sufferers of aLL grumblings.\" When one of the patients, Herr Kloterjahn\u2019s wife, asks another, \u201cWhy are you in Einfried, really?...What cureareyou taking, HerrSpinell?\u201d he answers: Cure?

SADO MASOCHISM Krafft Ebing's ideas seem also to have influenced other architects and urban planners, such as Camillo Sitte, who criticized the design ofthe modern city because in his view, it was causing agoraphobiaand other nervous conditions. In his 1889 book City Planning according to Artistic Principles, fig.47 he advocated intimate urban spaces that, as in a medi evalcity, protectthe inhabitant.Adolf Loos,also a studentof masochism\u2014there are multiple references inhis writings\u2014 argues that the \"man with modern nerves\" can't tolerate ornament. In 1926, he gave four lectures in German at the Sorbonne,inParis.Thewholeseries was entitledOerMensch mit den modemen Nerven (The man with modern nerves) CHAPTERi, fig.39 and dedicated to how to live one\u2019s life appropriately: how to walk, how to sit, how to lie down, how to eat, how to sleep, how to dress. and how to inhabit.23 The subject ofthe nerves had preoccupied Loos all his life and permeated his writings from the turn ofthecenturyon. ForLoos,the rejection of ornament is not an aesthetic theory, but a physiological reaction, as he put it when discussing the English military uniform as a model for modern dress: \u201cThe nerves of the modern man rebel against 84 47 Tuberculosis 85 48 49 Glasarchitektur Paid Sc:beerbarl 4tT St^\u201e/B\u00abU W9 1514 a demand to go back twenty, fifty, or a hundred years.\"26 He argued that human biology had evolved to give modern rran a whole new set of nerves with their own needs27 In \u201cOrnament and Education\" (1924) he wrote: \u201cModern Man, the man endowed with a modern nervous system, doesn't need ornament. On the contrary, he loathes it. Every object that we call modern lacks ornament. Our. dresses, our rrachines, our furs. and every object of everyday use don\u2019t have\u2014since the French Revolution\u2014any ornament.\"28 But the obsession with nerves wasn'tjust a Viennese hang up. In his Glasarchitektur of 1914, Paul Scheerbart wrote: \u201cSanatoria also will want glass buildings; the influence of splendid glass architecture on the nerves is indisputable.\"29 fiss.48, 49 Scheerbart was obsessed with hygiene and the removal of dust, pollen, and insects, advocating the use of the recently invented vacuum cleaner at home and in the streets. Heeven saw building materials intheseterms, enlisting doctors to further hisarchitectural polemic against brick: \u201cThe discovery of the brick bacillus\" means that \u201cnow the doctor also has a major interest in finally ousting the cult of brick.\"30 The polemic against brick was now supported by medical arguments. In his telegram novella, \u201cThe Oceanic Sanatorium for Hay Fever,\" he imagines: 48 Pad Scheerbart, Glasarchitektur, Berlin,1914,cover 49 Pad Scheerbart, 1897 50 Publicity brochureforthe Waldsanatorium, Davos, Switzerland. 1911 51 Schatzalp sanatorium, Davos. ca.1900. postcard Floating islands with breezy, colorful glass pavilions... floating cities with grass tennis courts, sea terraces, and many other things....

Our 86 Oceanic Sanatorium Society fo Hay Fever has found just the right thing: floating islands that will always drift hundredsof miles awayfrom dryland and natural islands. On our islands, dirt will be nonexistent.31 Scheerbart saw modern technologies as both the cause and the cureof illnesses. He writes of\u201cnerte doctors\" prescribing the calming effect of colored light insanatoriums, The idea was to counteract the \u201cnervous effect of very bright light\" that he saw as responsible in part for\"the nervous ailments of our time.\"32 Already in 1901, he speculated about \"air sanatoria\u201d flying in the sky to deal with the nervous disorders produced by modern traffic^ But air technology, which is at the centerof all Scheerbart\u2019s utopian novels, is both cure and cause. In a prewar manifesto for pacifism written in 1914, he predicted that air warfare, as the epitome of modern machinery, would produce \"general insanity\":\u2018:.Justthink ing about all these military techniques can have a deleterious effect on one\u2019s nerves.\" 34 For him, at least, it was prophetic. He suffered a nervous breakdown over the carnage of World War I and starved himself to death in 1915, seemingly in protest. Since he had net taken part in the war, it was as if\u201cjustthinking\u201dhad indeed provoked his death. THEARCHITECTURAL CURE Davos in Switzerland was famouslythe epicenter ofthe phenomenon of the modern cure. fig.6o In 1910, there were as many as twenty six sanatoriums and forty six hotels that cateredto\u201cconsumptives.\"TheSchatzalp, fig.bi builtbetween Tuberculosis 87 52 \"Liegekur\" (lying cure) onthe terrace of the Villa Pravenda, Oavos,ca. 1900 53 Lying cure, Oavos, ca. 1910, postcard 54 Katia Mann with her children (Monica, Golo, Michael, Klaus.Elizabeth. and Erika), ca. 1920 53 Liegekur ARTIST.

It had steam floor heating and a flat roof with inside drainage. The most advanced medical treatment coincided with the most advanced technology in architecture. The architecture of the Schatzalp is brutally modern in its horizontality and abstraction. With its 100 meter long facade and endless corridors, the building is like an ocean liner. All parts are subordinated to terraces intended as therapeutic spaces, dimensioned for a patient reclining in a specially designed chaise longue, a cure to be undertaken from 7:00 a.m.to 10:00 p.m., in winter as well as in summer. A period photograph shows a group of patients lying in chairs packed closely together on the terrace, covered in a thick blanket of snow, yet seemingly happy. fig.53 Thomas Mann, always sensitive to architectural detail, describes the therapeutic chaise longue with care, evoking a philosophy of life on the edge in the horizontal. This therapy of the horizontal also was central to the Waldsanatorium, also in Davos, where Katia Mann, Thomas\u2019s wife, stayed and that inspired him to write The Magic Mountain. Mann\u2019s novel evokes the social life in this very modern building, where everything was wrapped in white, Tuberculosis even the patient, who was wrapped in white to receive hydrotherapy. FIG.40 Katia Mann was in fact one of the first patients in this brand new sanatorium. She fell ill in 1912, a year after the birth of her fourth child. Her mother was convinced that Katia was suffering not from tuberculosis, but from exhaustion, having had four children and two miscarriages in less than fiveyears, managing a large household, and even typing Mann's manuscripts.36 Katia had been studying mathematics and experimental physics\u2014with Wilhelm Rontgen, the discoverer of X rays, no less\u2014but her mother had encouraged her to abandon her studies to marry Thomas Mann at the age of twenty one. Whatever her ailment, she stayed inand outofseveral sanatorijms up to 1914. Katia had no doubt that it was tuberculosis. As she wrote in her memoirs, it was \u201can old tubercular spot that seemed to be arrested;\u2019 but she claimed she was \u2018not seriously ill\u201c and perhaps the \u201cwhole thing would have cleared up by itself if we hadn\u2019t been able to afford a sanatorium. It was the custom. ifyou hadthe means, to go to Davos or Arosa.\"37 Tuberculosis was often confounded with nervous disorders, and its inevitable melancholy meant the standard curewas also a psychological one. Sanatoriums offered not just an escape from the city, but an escape from normal domestic life, with the comfort of a controlled regime and asteady, yet distracting daily rhythm in the companyof new friends.

Zonnestraal means \u201csunbeam\" iri Dutch. It was designed by JaO Duiker and Bernard Bijvoetas a sanatorium for the General Diamond Workers\u2019 Union of the Netherlands. In this white building of reinforced concrete, the medical properties of the architecture are taken to the extreme, almostas a manifesto. fig.57 Zon nestraal was a health machine\u2014a factory for the manufacturing of healthy bodies. Its slogan: \u201cLaat Licht, Lucht en zon\u201d (Allow light, air, and sun). fig.ss Here, patients were wheeled out of their independent rooms and onto the terrace. which was no longer a social space, as in earlier sanatoriums. There was less interactio n among patients. who seem in period photographs to keep their heads inside the room and inside their books. Fis.ssThe real interaction was only with the sun and with machines, complex instruments such as the latest respiratory analysis devices. fig.59 The individual rooms seem to have been an advance in a working class sanatorium, but reading Thomas Bernhard. who spent many years in and out of sanatoriums as a tuberculosis patient. which infiltrated all his writings, one becomes aware that there was nothing more terrifying to a sanatorium patient than being moved to an individual room.That could mean onlyone thing.39 bat licht Jucht en zon f Al' uw harne r volop hinnex/sfroomen !

Sanatoriums in Davos and in other places did not accept very ill patients. \u201cThe sanatorium is intended for incipient and curable cases,\" advised the British Journal of Diseases of the Chest in 1908, when giving an overview of reputable sanatoriums available in Europe for prospective patients.40 A death was a spot on their reputation. They even exaggerated their rate of curfo. Subterranean tunnels carried the dead away, out of view.41 And at the Schatzalp, 300 meters above the town of Davos, the bodies of the dead were sent down the mountain on toboggans in winter. as Thomas Mann describes in The Magic Mountain. Already in Tristan. Mann had written: \u201cSometimes a death takes place among the \u2018severe cases....' When this happens no one knows it, not even the person sleeping next door. in thesilence of the night, the waxen guest is put away and life at Einfried goes tranquilly on, with its massage, its electric treatment, douches, baths; with its exercises, its steaming and inhaling, in rooms especially equipped with allthe triumphs of modern therapeutic.\" 42 Paimio, which did not admit very ill patients, either, confined the most serious cases\u2014presumably those who got worse while atthe sanatori um\u2014tothe basement ofthe building. So much for the sun and air therapy. Architecture mayhave been seen as a medical instrument, butthe patient was removed from view when the instrument didn\u2019t provide the expected results. Modern architecture represented cure but couldn\u2019t face failure. It was a bright representation of optimism inserted in place ofthe fear of disease. Tuberculosis Death in modernity is hidden. Visual hygiene also means designing what you don't see or don\u2019t want to see. In Otto Wagner\u2019s plan for the Groszstadt (1911), Fis.eo high speed trains (what was the rush) were to remove the dead, transporting corpses in their coffins from specially designated mortuary stations to the cemeteries in the outskirts of the city: \u201cEvery large city will soon be in a position to limit the transportation of corpsesto railroads, and it see ms therefore proper to provide each ward with a mortuary station for this purpose.\"43 DOMESTICATINGTHE SANATORIUM More significantthan the architecture ofthe sanatorium as medical instrument is the impact of medical thought on all of modern architecture. the constant preoccupation with ventilation, sunlight, hygiene, and white walls that turned all buildings into medical equipment. As Ulrich puts it in Robert Musil's The Man without Qualities, a novelabout 1913 Vienna, written between 1930 and 1943: \u201cModern man is born in hospital and dies in hospital\u2014hence he should also live in a place like a hospital.\"This maxim, headds,\"had just been formulated by a leading architect. and another one, a reformer of interior decoration, demanded movable partition walls in flats.\u201d44 figs.si,6j Musil was probably referringto Otto Wagner, who had alreadyformulated the idea that modern man should live in a place like a hospital when he claimed thatthe hotel room should not be very different than the hos pital room: clean white surfaces should replace the upholstered interiors of 94 60 Otto Wagner, XXIInd Viennese district, published in Die Gros^s^t, 1911 61 Robert Musil(i880M942) 62 Robert Musil, Der MannrtolmaEr1J8n (The Moo wiihourOua/ities), 1stedition,1943,cover the nineteenth century hotel, where dust accumulates and iLlness is Latent. Instead of the \u201cpri ncely apartments\" usualLy requested, he proposed minimum, hygienic rooms with functional equipment that, in his view, \u201cwouLd give far greater comfort.\u201d45'The medipaL and the domestic were interconnected. He thought \u201cthe architect has tokeepfully abreast of this field [hygiene] too becausethese modern achievements demand truly new artistic forms.\"46 New medicine called for a new architecture and a new idea of comfort. \u201cComfort isoLates,\" WaLter Benjamin wrote, \"on the other hand, it brings those enjoying it closer to mechanization.\u201c47 Intimacy with equipment produces detachment from the world, the very principle of the hospital room. Wagner\u2019s Lectures argued for domestic architecture to be a fusion of the machine and the hospitaL. As his students. recallinghis teachings, put it: The buildingmustfunction like a ::>erfectLy constructed machine; it must in its installation beon the level ofthe wagons lit; and it must in matters of hygiene and cLeanliness, of all objects for use, be up to clinicaL demands. What is needed is a synthesis of hospitaL, sLeeping car and machine... It shouLd be evident that the probLem is not one of good tasteor aesthetics, but entirely of technicaL and constructional execution....

The nerves of the building have to be taken care of as much as the nerves of the occupant. But Wagner's nerves were not like those of Sitte or Krafft Ebing. Wagner thought that the modern individual had become accustomed to the abstraction of long avenues and uniform facades and preferred the anonymity of the metropolis to claustrophobic, small community life. According to him, the modern eye had lost its feelings for \"small and intimate proportions, it has grown accustomed to less varied images, longer and straighter lines, larger areas and greater masses.\"49 City dwellers, he believed, prefer to disappear in the crowd, to become a \u201cnumber.\" The point of city life, for Wagner, is to make it possibletoavoid social contacts8 To hark back to tradition, to make \u201cexpression\u201c or picturesqueness the controlling consideration in designing homesfor the manofto dayis absurd inthe lightof modern experience. The number of city dwellers who to day prefer to vanish in the mass as mere numbers on apartment doors is considerably greater than of those who care to hear the daily, \u201cgood morning, how are you\"from gossipy neighbors insingle houses.51 96 63 66 Both the word \u201chospital\" and the word \u201chotel\" derive from the Latin hospes, the guest or the host.52 Wagner thought of the hotel room in much the same way he thought of the hospital room: \u201cWhat is required of hotel accommodation in nearly all case? is a quiet, clean, hygienic room, where the guest is able to sleep undisturbed and attend to his physical needs.\"53 The ro.omsfor his Hotel Wienjn the Ringstrasse (1910) were rendered with the sparse furniture and ascetic aesthetic of a room in Hoffmann\u2019s Purkersdorf: simple' white bed, table, and chairs, without any draperies or carpets. In the foreground of one of the renderings, a woman in uniform appears to be vacuuming the floor, as if to emphasize the cleanliness, the dust free environment. fig. S3 In fact, every building, and not just hotels, became a kind ofsanatorium.Take, for example, the Open Air School in Amsterdam, fig.67 built in 1929, a couple of years after Zonnestraal. lt was designed by the same architects, Duiker and Bijvoet, who now applied its principles of light, air, and sun to healthy children. They were placed inside a glass machine and even required to sit up on the roof, heads against the glass parapet, in the bright sun, with their sunglasses on. fig.65 The buildingwasconceived as a lightdevice like those used for light therapy in the 1930s. fig.66 Modern architecture went from being the cure for tuberculosis to being an apparatusfortheprevention oftuberculosis. The open air school was an international movement, starting with the Wald Oberschule in Berlin, Charlotten bu rg, which opened in 1904for\u201cpretubercu lar\"children. fig.64 Tuberculosis 97 65 65,67 Bernard Bijvoet.Jan Duiker,OpenAir School for Healthy Children, Amsterdam, 1927 1930 66 French children duringan indoor heliotherapy session. 1937 Eugene Beaudouin, Marcel Lods, Eco/edeplein oir (open air school), MontValerien, Suresnes (a commu ne outside Paris), 1931 1935 68 Cowrof album of postcards of the Eco/e depleiooir 69,7i Postcards of children resting and bathing in the sun inSuresnes open air school 70 Cl<ssroom with retractable walls 98 Illllllin 68 Tuberculosis 99 Richard Docker.

The open air school Ecole de plein air, built by Eugene Beaudouinand MarcelLods atMontValerien in Suresnes (a commune outside Paris) from 1931 to 1935, presented an uncanny resemblance between the body of the building, organized like a series of lungs, and the body ofthe breathingoccupants. figs.s9 71 Modern architects were not the only ones advocating life in a sanatorium; their promoters. the critics, and their historians were, too. Take, for example, Sigfried Giedion\u2019s 1929 little book Befreites Wohnen (Liberated dwelling), fis.7* subtitled Licht, Luft, Oeffnung (Light, air, opening), almost like the slogan of a sanatorium. Between the covers of a book about the modern house we find more than half of the illustrat ions dedicated to hospitals and sports: Richard Docker's sanatorium in Waiblingen (1926 1928),fig. n Bijvoet and Duiker\u2019s Zonnestraal, sanatoriums in Davos, fig.79 mountain lodges, seaside resorts, sports stadiums, images of gymnastics, sunbathing, tennis.... fig.tb By the time we finally get to the houses, we may have forgotten that we were actually reading a book on the modern house.The few that G:edion included have effectively been turned into sanatoriums, with convalescents resting on long chairs on terraces (as in a picture ofa Max Haefeli house in Zurich of 1928 fig.si) orgyms,as in Marcel Breuer\u2019s bedroomfor Piscator in Berlin (1927 1928), Fia.2eAndre Lurcat\u2019s rooftop gym on the Guggen buhl House in Paris (1926 1927), fig. wand Richard Doc ker\u2019s 100 Il terrace with exercise equipment in his Weissenhofsiedlung house in Stuttgart (1927). fig.\u00ab And Giedion was not the only one. Another influential book ofthattime, Docker's Terrassentyp of 1927, fig. n follows thedevelopmentofthe terrace in modern architectu re from the sanatorium to the home, starting with Docker's own sanatorium in Waiblingen figs.24, 74, n and proceeding to Zonnestraal; Davos, arid so on, delineating a seamlesstran sition from the terraces of sanator ums fig.n to those of modern houses. Diagrams showthe penetration of sunrays in modern sanatoriums and in modern terrace houses showing how to maximize the exposure. fig.7s The book concludes with a series ofphotographs ofdomestic terraces furnished with exercise equipment, as in Docker's apartment in the Weissenhof in Stuttgart, Le Corbusier\u2019s terraces, and the terraces of Robert Mallet Stevens's Villa Noailles (19231927) in Hy\u00e8res. Villa Noaillesis a symptomatic casestudy. In one ofthe first articles about the house in Art et D\u00e9coration (July 1928) it is described as organized by a \u201ccult of hygiene\": sunlight, exercise, and fresh air take precedence over traditional forms of comfort. figs.83,84 Bedrooms are modest in size, but each is connected to its own bathroom and its own terrace for outdoor sleeping. The master be Groom's open air sleeping loft was designed by Pierre Chareau, with a metal bed suspended inthe air, \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9ricai ne,\u2019\u2019fiG.ss as thearticle in Art et D\u00e9coration describes it, and metal sliding doors by Jean Prouv\u00e9.

A covered swimming pool had a mechanism, probably designed by Prouv\u00e9, that allowed the enormous glass walls to retreat into the ground, opening the pool to the vast outdoor exercise area. The house even had asquash court, where Charles de Noailles played with Luis Bunuel.5' There was a personal trainer for the owners and their guests, Monsieur Tar\u00e9, who features in afilm byJacques ManueL, Biceps etbijoux (1928), Fia.ss comm issioned by theclients. They aLso commissioned Man Ray to make a film, Les Myst\u00e8res du Ch\u00e2teau du De (1929), using the house as a set for endless exercise confused with Surrealist play, with the clients and their guests themselves as actors in striped exercise gear.55 oss^ea But health, for Marie Laure and Charles de Noailles, was morethan a creative obsession. Likemanyofthe\u201cf ragile people\" who came to Hy\u00e8res to \u201csoften\u201c their illnesses, t hey sought airand sun. In fact, Marie Laure, Fioe born in Paris as the daughterof German Jewish bankers and a descendent on her mother\u2019s side from the Marquis de Sade, had for heaLth reasons been raised in a viLLa in Grasse, France. Her father had died of tubercuLosis when she was a baby. The radicaL house she commissioned from Mallet Stevens is sited and shaped by theshadow ofthedisease itaims to resist. The association of the modern house with hospital sometimes confused even professional critics and historians. Richard Neutra's Lovell Health House (1929) in Los AngeLes, for exampLe, a domestic project for a private client, was referred to as a \u201cnursing home\" by architecturaL historian Leonardo Benevolo58 The house was another doctor 104 architect collaboration, this time between Neutra and Dr. Philip Lovell. fig.90 Design operates for Neutra at the intersection of biology and psychology as a therapeutic defense against the \"disastrous effects\" of all the accumulated conditions of modern life. He writes about how the \"warm, moist air practically stationary, saturated with airborne bacteria, and recirculated thro ugh many lungs, had made tuberculosisendemiCand ofthe need for design to address both \u201cpathology, the manifest spreading of disease,\"and psychological comfort, what he calls, earlier in the book, \"nervous health,\u201d57 Neutra's sensitivity to nervous illness is autobiographical. ln a letterto her mother, Dione Neutrawrites that Richard suffered from \u201cterrible depression,\u2019 a recurring condition throughout his life. Ironically, it was the stresses of complet ingthe Health House and dealing withthe Lovells that seems to have caused the physical and mental exhaustion that Neu tra'swifementions inthisparticular letter. ForNeutra, mental and physical health were always intertwined. He insisted, for example, that the success of his own tropical classroom design was notjust that \u201cairborne bacteria no longer hover in the classroom\" and \"expectoration dries promptly. quickly diminishing in contagiousness.\" It is equally in the calmingand delightful sensation ofcool air passing across the skin asthe large fold up doors extend the possible classroom space.5\u00bb Neutra provides both bacteriological and nervous order, each understood as either cure or preve ntion of disease. It is important to note that Neutra himself had tuberculosis and spent ayear in a sanato rium in Switzerland.

Several of Neutra's clients had tuberculosis\u2014Howard Bald, for example, who was brought to Los Angeles at theageof eightfor thecure.ln fact, Southern California was tuberculosis central. Many people migrated there for the cure\u2014as did modern architecture. Even the great critic of modern architecture, Esther McCoy, originally came to California for the cure. fig.\u00bb9 Modern architecture thus is occupied 'by and organized around two emblematic figures: the fragile tuberculosis patient seeking a cure and the athletic figure seeking prevention from the diseases of modernity. Even the body of the architect becomes part of the project. A photograph ofAino Aalto lying on the chaise longue she designed on the terrace of the sanatorium at Paimio shows the architect in the position ofthe patient. fg.91 And a photograph of Duiker flipping into a pond portrays the architect in the active position of the healthy amateur athlete in the outdoors. fig.sz Neither is exactly the typical heroic pose of the architect in front of a building. Not only did modern architects emphasize health and exercise in oppositiontothe dangersofdisease, sometimes presenting themselves as models, but their architecture was understood that way. The buildings became unconsciously identified with the need to produce a healthy body. For example, Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Tugendhat House (19291930) in Brno, which had been abandoned during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia,59 was turned first into a physical education institute of Karla Hladka, fis.ss then 108 s9 Esther McCoy 90 Or.

The Tugendhats may have understood the house as a machine for health, too. In response to architectural critic Justus Bier, who had polemically asked the question, \u201cIs the Tugendhat house habitable?\" in the pages of thejournal Die Form, 61 FritzTugendhat symptomatically invoked Davos: \u201cAfter almost a year of living in the house, I can assure you without hesitation that technically it possesses everything a modern person might wish for....On clear and frosty days, one can lowers its windows, sit in the sun, and enjoythe view of a snow covered landscape, like Davos.\"62 fig.ss In winter, the family would sit by the big glass wall in the living room, which could be lowered into the ground until it disappeared completely, taking the sun and the fresh air with the snow outside, \u201clike Davos,\" a sanatorium. Photographs of the family by amateur photographer and filmmaker Fritz Tugendhat show the children playing and running around naked in the outdoor spaces of the house, evoking ideasofthe Lebensreform movement. GreteTugendhat, according to Irene Kalkofen, nanny of the Tugend hat children, was always afraid of the children falling ill, and whenever oneofthem was sick,they were isolated in Irene\u2019s 110 Tuberculosis 97 room while she slept in another child\u2019s room to avoid contagion.63 The idea of a separate space to quarantine sick children was a standard part of a modern bourgeois house, as inAdolfLoos\u2019 Muller House in Prague. Fritz Tugendhat himself was not in good health atthe time ofthe com mission, Mies recalls: \u201cHe was a very careful man and he was sick. He did not believe inone doctor only; he had three.\"64 What Mies didn\u2019t seem to realize is that this was not that unusual. Uncertainty in the early twentieth century aboutthe new scientific medicine made it commonplace among the bourgeoisie to consult different kinds of doctors and alternative practitioners and to follow multiple kinds of advice. In a sense, the architect was added as yet another medical consultant. Even proposals for a modern city were imagined in health terms: from Ebenezer Howard's Garden City (1898) to Arturo Soria y Mata's Ciudad Lineal (1897), to Otto Wagner's Die Groszstadt (1911) to Le Corbusier's Radiant City (1935). Tony Garnier\u2019s influential proposal for an Industrial City (1904), for instance, featured the heliotherapy building fig.97 of the hospital complex occupying the highest point of the plan. dominating the city from the hillside, with the sports center right in the middle of town, as if replacing the cathedral of medieval times. Health had become a new form of religion. and modern architecture built its temples. Giedion describes Garnier\u2019s heliotherapy project in Buildingin France, Building in Iron, Building in Ferroconcrete (1928), FiG.9s his first book on modern architecture:\u201cElevators carry the convalescent in his bed to the generous terraces to 12 97 Tony Garnier, heliotherapy building in Une crie industrielle, 1904 98 L\u00e2s2l6 Moholy Nagy, cover ofSigfried Giedion\u2019s Bauen in Fronkreich, 8ouen in Eisen.

Despite the heaviness of 1 :r details of the design, the eye, through the inter play of the various horizontal surfaces, has an impression of the air always separating and hovering,just as ourfuture cities will be' shaped.\u201d\u00ae5 Giedion\u2019s passing comment that the therapeutic horizontality designed for the convalescents will soon shape all future cities suggests a completely new explanation for the relentless horizontal framing of modern architecture. Could it in fact be related to the horizontality of thei occupant\u2014the tuberculosis convalescent lying on the chaise and the psychoanalytic patient on the couch, the paradigmatic clients of modern architecture? As Erich Mendelsohn put it:\u201cModern man, amidst the flurry of his fast moving life, can find equilibrium only in the tension free horizontal.\"66 The horizontal itself becomes emblematic of health. Both the horizontal view from the inside and the view of horizontals from the outside induce health. The sanatorium aesthetic was itself medicinal\u2014 ableto transform any building into a form oftherapy. Tuberculosis 113 1 While thesanatorium is often attributed to AlvarAalto alone, as early as 1933 he acknowledged the collaboration with hiswife, Aino Marsio Aalto, and the participation of the Norwegian architects Erling BJertnas and Harald Wildhagen, as well as the Finish architects LauriSipila and Lars Wiklund.Alvar Aalto, \u201cPaimion Parantola\" (Paimio Sanatorium), Arkkrtehti 1933, pp. 79 90. 2 Sigfried Giedion,Spoce, Time ond Architecture: The Growth ofo New Tradition (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1949), 8th enlarged printing, pp. 463 and 466. 3 In rny first visit to Paimio in 1994, I was told by the person in chargeof the building that the upper terrace of the san a torium was off limits and in response to my insistence claimed that it had been closed to prevent suicide.

I ndeed, therewas never a scientific study of its value: \"Thegreat sanatorium movement... was never subjected to a scientific trial of its effectiveness. But there is abundance of indirect evidence to suggest that such general measures would not cure a patient who was seriously infected. In rnild and early cases, it seems likely that life could be prolonged and that thecourseof the disease could be slowed down, allowing the body's natural defenses a better chance of healing.\u201c Frank Ryan, Tu bercu/osis: The Greatest Story Neever Told (Bromsgrove: Swift,. 1992), p. 27. 5 Goran Schildt,AlvorAolto: The Complete Catologue ofArchitecture, Design and Art, trans.

Architecture hereis less about shelterand more about exposure\u2014X ray exposure. / As X rays became indelibly associated with tuberculosis, the tuberculosis patient became the paradigm of this new way ofth in kingabout bodies, objects,and psychologies. In Illness as Metaphor, Sontagwrites: TB makes the body transparent. The X rays which are the standard diagnostic tool permit one, often for the firsttime,toseeone's insides\u2014to becometransparent to oneself. While TB is understood to be, from early on, rich in visible symptoms (progressive emaciation, coughing, languidness, fever), and can be suddenly and dramatically revealed (the blood on the handkerchief), in cancer the main symptoms are thought to be, characteristically, invisible\u2014until the last stage, when it is too late. The disease, often discovered by chance or through a routine medical checkup, can be far advanced without exhibiting any appreciable symptoms. One has an opaque body that must be taken to a specialistto find out if it contains cancer. What the patient cannot perceive, the specialist will determine by analyzing tissues taken from the body. TB patients may see their X rays or even possess them: 117 the patients at the sanatorium in The Magic Mountain carry theirs around in their breast pockets. Cancer patients don\u2019t look attheir biopsies.2 Indeed, patients in the sanatorium in The Magic Mountain even carry the X rays of their loved ones in their breast pockets. When Clavdia Chauchat, Hans Castor\u2019s love object, leaves the sanatorium she gives him her X ray as a memento: Then he flung himself into his chair, and drew out his keepsake, histreasure,that consisted,thistime, not of a few reddish brown shavings, but a thin glass plate, which must be held toward the lightto see anything on it. It was Clavdia\u2019s x ray portrait. sh owing not herface. but the delicate bony structure ofthe upper half of her body, and theorgansofthethoracic cavity, surrounded by the pale, ghostlike envelope of flesh. How often had he looked at it, how often pressed it to his lips in the time which since then had passed and brought its changes with it\u2014such changes as. for i nstance, getting used to life up here without Clavdia Chauchat, getting used, that is, to her remoteness in space!3 The X ray is a kind of self exposure, a new, more intimate kind of portraitof oneself orofsomeone close to you. To analyze the canon of modern architecture in these terms is to do a kind of X ray of the canon, a disciplinaryself exposure. 118 1 WilhelmRontgen\u2019s first publication of the X rays discovery, December 28,1895 a wayof getting closer to our object by allowingarchitecture to see itself, to see what is always there, but overlooked. A NEW TRANSPARENCY When Wilhelm Conrap R\u00f6ntgen first published his very recent discovery of the X ray in December of 1895 in an artice translated the following month as \u201cOn a Ngw Kind of Rays, a Preliminary Communication,\u201d fig. 1 he wrote about a newform of transparency in which \"bodies behave to the X rays as turbid media to light.\"4 The invisible rays are described as a \"medium\" that penetrates objects and is revealed on screens. A technical surface acts as the most intimate witness of the otherwise hidden interior. In the early decades of the twentieth century architects, histori ans,andtheorists quickly absorbed the new paradigm, with its inversion of the classical relationship between inside and outside, developing an entire logic ofthe invisible that remains largely in place, anarchitecturewe still live with in our countless screens monitoring endless invisibleflows. This new concept of transparency is intimately linked to the idea ofa \u201cscreen.\" The screen that R\u00f6ntgen describes was actually made of a piece of paper coated with a thin layer ofbarium platinum cyanide, which glows fluorescent when exposed to X rays. He marvels at the fact that paper itself is very transparent, so the \u201cfluorescent screen\" is really just the thin layer of barium platinum cyanide. But it is not just a sheet of paper that is transparent. Even \u201ca thousand page book\u201c placed behind the screen becomes transparent \u201cThick blocks ofwood are stilltransparent:\u2019 It takes X Ray Intimacy 119 2 s many layers for tinfoil to barely cast a \u201cshadow\" on the screen, and it takes a very thick sheet of aluminum to reduce the fluorescence. figs.2,3 Rontgen\u2019s discovery was a radical transformation of the concepts of materiality and solidity, inverting the conventional understanding of what is visible and invisible. Rontgen's screen showed, in the words of his first report, that \u201call bodies possess this same transparency, but in very varying degrees.\u201d5 Transparency, therefore, is a property of seemingly opaque bodies, including the human body. In other words, transparency is not an effect. The X ray is notsomething done to an object. The object isalreadytrans parent, and the X rays allow us to see it as such.Thewhole world is now understood to be transparent. More than simply affecting architecture, Rontgen\u2019s discovery was a transformation of space. Having studied the transparency of many materials, including glass itself, which paradoxically is more opaque (because it contains lead), R\u00f6ntgen looked through the human body: \u201cIf the hand be held before the fluorescent screen,\" he writes,\u201cthe shadow showsthe bones darkly, with only faint outlines of the surroundingtissues.\"6The famous X ray image ofthe hand of his wife Bertha R\u00f6ntgen, with her wedding ring onthemiddle finger, taken onlyfivedays before he submitted the article for publication, is used as an illustration\u2014 as proof ofthe astonishing revelation7 fig.4 The story of this image, which was crucial to the popular success ofthe invention, isthat R\u00f6ntgen, afraid of revealing his stunning discovery to his colleagues, brought his 120 2 First X ray images of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, 1895, as published in the English translation ofRontgen's article 3 Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen wife to the laboratory the evening of December 22, 1895, after months of experimentation with inanimate objects, and exposed her hand to the X rays for fifteen minutes, producing the first X ray of a human body. Upon seeing the image of her' hand, Bertha Rontgen famously said, \u201cI have seen my death,\u201d8 anticipating a common popular reaction tosuch exposures\u2014like seeing a ghost, or even seeipg yourself as a ghost. ' Rontgen's article stimulated an enormous double response. Scientists all around the world seized on the idea and tried to replicate the experiment. The popular press ignited a huge speculation about the possible uses and meaning ofthese images. Newspapers were galvanized by the idea of an invisible world. The image of Bertha\u2019s hand gave way to a whole genre ofsuch images in both scientific and popular publications. Countless X ray images of hands were made by Rontgen himself and others soon after the article was published. In his first public lecture about the discovery, delivered in W\u00fcrzburg on January 13, 1896, Rontgen exposed the hand of Professor Albert von Kolliker, fig.6 afamous anatomistand presidentoftheW\u00fcrzburg Physical and MedicalSociety. Summoned to Berlin by the emperor to reporton thediscovery, heX rayedthe hands ofthe Emperor Wilhelm II and the Empress Augusta Victoria. Later, he also did the hands of the Duke and Duchess of York and the Emperor and Empress of Russia, among many other notables. fig.6 The hand X ray had become a new kind of intimate portrait and the icon ofa new worldview in which everything, no matter how seemingly impervious, becomes intimate.

Ah i Lovely, cruel, sweet cathode a graph! X Ray Intimacy 123 R\u00f6ntgen had named the mysterious phenomenon \u201cX rays\" because he didn't know what they were. Koliker had proposed. after R\u00f6ntgen's W\u00fcrzburg lecture, thatthe new rays be called \u201cR\u00f6ntgen rays,'' but self effacing R\u00f6ntgen preferred to continue to call them X rays. The justification of the term \u201crays,\u201d he claimed in that first article, lay in the \u201cshadow pictures\" produced by interposing a body between the source ofthe X rays and a photographic plate or a screen. He wrotethat in the two months before he X rayed his wife\u2019s hand, he had \u201cobserved and photographed manysuch shadow pictures,'' including a set of weights inside a wooden box and a compass card and needle completely enclosed in a metal case.9 R\u00f6ntgen considered this ability to make photographs of the \u201cshadow pictures\" on the screen of \u201cspecial interest,\u201d because it made it possibleto \u201cexhibit the phenomena so as to exclude the dangeroferror.\"10The main advantagefor him, therefore. was to provide proof, to confirm the observations already made multiple times with the fluorescent screen. Soon after its initial publication, he sent reprints ofthe article together with prints ofthe X ray images he had taken to many scientists, including Emil Warburg in Berlin and Henri Poincare in Paris.11 Warburg immediately added the X ray images to an exhibition that was mounted on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berlin Physical Society at Berlin University. This was the first public exhibition of X ray images. Without these images, the discovery of the X rays would have had less of an impact in both scientific and lay circles. It was front page news in many newspapers world 124 wide. fig.7 OnJanuary 5, 1886, Die Presse in Vienna was the first to report on the discovery, with an article entitled \u201cEine Sensationelle Entdeckung\" (A sensational discovery).*2 in their haste, they misspelled Rontgen\u2019s name as \u201cRoutgen.\u2019\u2019 The nextday,The Standard newspaper in London cabled the following news release to the world, repeating the misspelled name and misidentifying Bertha's hand as^that of a man: The noise of war's alarm should not distract attention from the marvellous triumph of Science which is reported from Vienna. It is announced that Professor Routgen of Wurzburg has discovered a light which, for the purposeof photography, will penetrate wood, flesh and most other organic substances. The Professor has succeeded in photographing metal weights which were in a closed wooden case, also a man\u2019s hand, which shows only the bones, theflesh being invisible.'2 When The Standard reported on the story in the newspaper of January 7, 1896, they felt obliged to add: \u201cThe Presse assures its readers that there is no joke or humbug in the matter. It is a serious discovery by a serious German Professor.\"*4 The Frankfurter Zeitung published the news, also on January 7 and was thefirstto print the images. Newspapers around the world, from Le Matin and L'Illustration in Paris, to the Krakow based Czas, to the New York Times, St. Louis Dispatch, and Sydney Telegraph, among many others, continued to sensationalize the discovery and anticipate its X Ray Intimacy 8,9 Josef Maria Ederand Eduard Valenta, Photographie mittelstder Rontgen Strohien, 1896, cover and Chamaleon cristatus 10 Spread from L.

Czas, for example, wrote: \u201cthe problem, although it seems an All Fools\u2019 Day joke, is seriously considered in serious circles:'15 A MAGIC SCREEN Following R\u00f6ntgen's invention, many people developed tech n ques for photographing the X ray effect. R\u00f6ntgen had refused several offers to patent hisdiscovery, declaring that it belonged to humanity. Sadly, he died in nearpoverty. From the beginning, he provided detailed accounts of his method, allowing others to experiment. Within a month of R\u00f6ntgen's publication, Josef Maria Eder (director of an Austrian institute for graphic processes and author of an early history of photography)16 and the photo chemist Eduard Valenta published Versuche \u00fcber Photographie mittelst der Ront gen'schen Strohlen (Research on photography with R\u00f6ntgen rays), fig.b an album of fifteen photogravures made from X rays, in which theydescribed in great detailthe procedure used and the improvements they had made to Rontgen's apparatus.17 Human hands and feet, fish, frogs, a snake, a chameleon, fig.9 a lizard, a rat, and a newborn rabbit were among the images in this album, a kind of zoo echoing nineteenth century naturalist albums of animals, insects, and plants, but also anticipating the \u201cnew vision\u201d of photography of Moholy Nagy and others in the 1920s.

Moholy Nagy would later write: The passion for transparencies is one ofthe most spectacular features of our time. In x ray photo s, structure becomes transparency and transparency manifests structure. The x ray pictures. to which the futurist has consistently referred, are among the out standing space time renderings on the static plane. They give simultaneously the inside and outside, the view of an opaque solid, its outline, but also its inner structure.18 What interests me here is how X ray images had transformed the visual field long before the so called avantgarde. The X ray was a new kind of realism, a realism that was in no way in opposition to a new kind of mysticism or spiritualism. William Crookes, the scientist who developed :he cathode ray tube used by Rontgen, was the president of the Society for Psychical Research and within a year of ihediscovery of X rays annou need that th ey produc ed a new sense of reality based not on outer surfaces, but inner vibrations, closer to consciousness itself, as Linda Henderson has pointed out_19 The Theosophist and women's rights activist Annie Besant wa s l ikewise trying to gi ve visible form to the invisible. Not by chance, many of the images of what she called \u201cthought forms\u201d have the appearanceofX rays.20 figs. 11,12 The X ray was an optical and philosophical revolution that swept the world at astonishing speed. The first 128 13 surgery with X rays was carried out in the United States within two months ofthe discovery. and thefi rstfu lly fledged department of radiology was established at the Glasgow Royal inti rmary within a year. fig.17 It is imp6rtantto note that in thealbums of X rays that proliferated everywhere at the tu rn of the century, X rays were still presented as images.of screens. Eve n booksaimed at popularizing science, such as the 1898 French book La Photographie de /'invisible, fio. iu carefully note below each image that it is' a \"shadow on a screen.\" For example, under the X ray of a frog we read: \"shadow on a fluorescent screen of a frog fixed with pins on a sheetof cork\u201d FIe.u or \u201cshadowof a hand on a screen of platinum cyanide of barium.\u201d21 The caption is needed because the screen itself disappears, since the paper support of the screen ias the same color as the page in the publication. The caption reminds the reader that there is a screen there, a screen that was originally chemicalson paper.The \"shadow image\u201dtakesthe place and the modality of a drawing, a ghostly trace hanging before theviewer and offering a deep gaze intothe secrets of a body or even of the cosmos itself. fig.is The floating, disappearing screen becomes the most powerful of instruments. R\u00f6ntgen was fascinated that he could also produce the efFect directly on a photographic plate. fig.is Within a year of the discovery of X rays, Eastman developed a special plate for X rays and a thin transparent surface would eventually take over the responsibility of the screen when Eastman introduced film, replac i ngthe glass photographic plate.

It is still the image of the screen. This magical and threatening screen effect rippled through society, becoming a new fQrm of spectacle. It was as if nothing could be seen the same way. Everything needed to be rethought. Every field seemed.to be affected by the magic screen\u2014science and medicine. of course, but also policing and entertainment, religion and spiritualism, where many seized upon theX ray as proof of what they believed all a lo ng. The screen was a site of intense speculation. From the very beginning, this visual revolution was understood as an assault on privacy and even a form of indecency. fig.is The London newspaper Pail Moll Gazette wrote in 1896: \"We are sick of the R\u00f6ntgen rays.... I t is now said that you can see other people's bones with the naked eye....

And a New Jersey assemblyman is supposed to have introduced a bill to ban X ray opera glasses, should they ever be invented. Thomas Edison, who exhibited X rays to the public in the New York Electrical Exhibition of 1896, even imagined thattheX ray would eventually read people\u2019s thoughts. TheX raywas alsoan immense form of entertainment.There were X ray machines in every scientific and popular fair. A leaflet distributed at an 1896 exhibition at the Crystal Palace, London, reads: \"BEFORE LEAVING THE EXHIBITION, \u2018SEE\u2019, THE WONDROUS X RAYS. The Greatest Scientific Discovery of the Age.... X RAY PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN.\" fig.io In Paris, the Grands Mogasins Oufoyei alternated demonstrations of an X ray machine with demonstrations of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers' moving pictures. fig.21 Customers could have an X ray taken of their hand or their feet as a souvenir.

This image was used to argue that radiation exposure duringX rayingwas negligible 24 X raydevice isused to expose a women hiding a bottle of liquor under her dress, 1897 neurs, some of whom believed that X rays would offer more entertainment value than the cinema. Business trade journals carried ads from impresarios trying to exchange their movie projectors for X ray equipment.24 In 1896, Blooming dales hired Columbia University physics senior Herbert Hawks to conduct public demonstrations of the X rays. There were X ray studios in all major cities. Coin operated X ray machines were installed in Chicago, where you could have an X ray for one dollar. It was a nervous kind of entertainment. The X ray had undone the logic of what is private and what is public. It represented a complete transformation not just of privacy, but also of public life. Changing what is seen is equ ally a changingofwhat is shared\u2014willingly or not. lnthatsense, it was a shock to social life and unleashed fears of intrusion and control. BUILDING THE NEW VISUAL FIELD X rays were almost immediately used for policing in customs checkpoints, where suitcases and people were subjected to exposure. In Paris railways stations,the police subjected passengers and their luggage to X rays as early as 1898. FG.22 An illustration ina Parisian newspapershows how a woman hiding a bottle of liquorunder her dress is exposed by the machine as the glass with lead becomes visible next to her femur in the X ray. fig.24 What is crucial here is the architecture of the scene. She is suspended behind a floating screen held in place by the assistant. She is occupying a new spaceof radical exposure. 134 The X ray thus was architectural from the beginning and remains so, as can be seen in image after image, like the photograph of an attractive blond woman behind a screen made in 1940 as a publicity imageto reassure the publicthat radiation from X rays vyas negligi ble. fig. 23 She is occupying a new technological space defined by a screen, rather than by..walls, a glowing screen with its shadow image. We are still in theterritory of Bertha R\u00f6ntgen and the ur image of her hand. The mysteries of the i nte rior are brought to the surface by a screen, and the flesh becomes just a faint outline. The body is literally turned insideout. Western architectu re, at least since the Italian Renaissance, has mod eled itself on the human body, butthe body is inverted with the arrival ofX ray\u2014withthe inside becoming the outside. Modern architecture absorbed the logic of the screen and even of the shadow image. Glass architecture echoes the logic of the X ray. There is an outer screen that disappears in order to register a ghostly image of the inside. It is X ray architecture. As with Rontgen\u2019s transformative images, X ray architecture is an image of an image\u2014the effect of an X ray, rather than an actual X ray. It's not so much that the inside of the building is exposed, but that the building represents exposure, and this exposure occurs on a screen. Glass is called on to simulate transparency. ThisX ray effect was integral to a new discourse about transparency. Arthur Korn\u2019s extraordinary 1929 book Gias im Bau und ais Gebrauchsgegenstand (Glass in construction and as a commodity), fig.26 translated into English as Glass 24 X Ray Intimacy 135 25 Walter Gro pius, Bauhaus Dessau, 1920s, illustration in Arthur Korn, Giosim Bou und ols Gebrouchsgegenstond, 1929 26 Arthur Korn, Gios im Bou und ols Gebrouchsge&nstond. 1929,cover in Modern Architecture, catalogues the new use of glass in architecture in 181 remarkable images, including not just architecture, but some furniture, light bulbs, and laboratory equipment. Korn notes, as ff surprised: The outside wall is no longer the first impression one gets of a building. It istheinterior, the spaces in depth and the structural frame which delineates them, that one beginsto noticethrough theglass wall.This wall is barely visible, and can only be seen when there are reflected lights, distortions or mirror effects.... Glass is noticeable yet not quite visible. It is the great membrane, fullof mystery, delicate yet tough.25 This sense of mystery, which X rays share, infuses Korn's book, as in a photograph of the Bauhaus building in Dessau where the glass wall is a kind of ripple. fig.2s The volume of the building within looms without definition, an effect found throughoutthe book. Korn's discussion oftransparency is an uncanny echo of Rontgen\u2019s discussion of new forms of transparency in the first publication of his discovery of X rays. Just as the body of the Bauhaus building appears, in this photograph, strangely blurry through the not quite visible glass, R\u00f6ntgen writes about the flesh becoming a kind of mysterious shadow while the bones are perfectly visible. Modern buildings even started to look like medical images.The impact of the technology of the X ray is evident in the work of many avant garde architects of the early 136 decades of the twentieth century. Mies van der Rohe wrote about his work as \u201cskin and bones\" architecture and rendered his projects for the Friedrichstrasse Skyscraper of 1919 and his Glass Skyscraper of 1922 as if seen through an X ray machine. FiG.2*,Mies was deeply interested in X ray imagesand used them as illustrations in his articles, as in the April 1926 issue of G, wherethesilhouette of the bead of a woman appears next to the X ray of the same head.26 fis.2? He even put an image of a bone alongside his glass skyscraper in an issue of the magazine Merz to drive the point home.J7FiG.29 Mies was not alone. Books on modern architecture are filled with images of glowing glass skins revealing inner bones and organs; they look like albums of X rays, reminiscent of the X ray atlases that proliferated in the early decades of the twentieth century.28 Think, for example, about Le Corbusier\u2019s project for the Glass Skyscraper (1925) fig.3i, Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer\u2019s Bauhaus (1925 1926), Brinkman and van der Vlugt's Van Nelle Factory (1925 1927) in Rotterdam fis.33, Erich Mendelsohn\u2019s Schocken Department Store (1926 1928) in Stuttgart fig 32, Buckminster Fuller\u2019s 4D Tower (1928) fis.36, George Keck's Crystal House (1933 1934) at the World\u2019s Columbian Exhibition in Chicago Fie.3s, Paul Nelson\u2019s Suspended House (1935), Frits Peutz\u2019s Schunck Glass Palace (1935) in Heerlen fig.37, Jaromir Krej car\u2019s Czech pavilion at the International Exhibition in Paris (1937) FiG.ao, and countless otherexamples.This is morethan a dominant aesthetic.

Although experiments with glass were numerous in the early years of the twentieth century, they still tended to be isolated esoteric projects by avant garde architects\u2014many developed as temporary buildings for fairs. Only by the mid twentieth century did the see through house become realized in Mies\u2019s Farnsworth House (1945 1951) in Plano, Illinois, fig.3b 38 Mies van der Rohe,Farnsworth House, Piano, Illinois, 1949 39 PhilipJohnson, GlassHouse, New Canaan, CT. 1949 40 \"He.ping those who helpthesick,'' advertisement for mobile X ray unit published in Life magazine, December 1945 41 Or.Scholl's Fluoroscopic Shoe X Ray, 1940s 42 \"Cooking Taught with Loving Care.\" advertisement for Pyrex, 1940 43 Ad for transparent plastic wrap Pliofilm, developed by Goodyear in 1934 and Philip Johnson\u2019s Glass House (1949) in New Canaan, Connecticut, fig.39 for example. Just astheX ray exposes the inside of the bodyto the public eye, the glass house exposes its interior. This exposure became a mass phenomenon with the ubiquitous picture window of the suburban American house at midcentury, perhaps not by chance at exactly the sametimethattheX ray itself becamea massphenomenon. By midcentury, the mass X raying of US citizens on a regular basis was established. With this development, the now visible interior of the body became not just a tool for diagnosis, but also the site of a new form of public sur veillance.The postwar mobilization againstTB included pro 142 40 41 grams for the massX ray surveying ofthe entire popu lation using mobile X ray machines in places such as department stores, industries, schools, suburban streets, and public markets. fig.4o Over a period of a half century, an experimental medicaltdol had bee n transformed into a mechanism of surveillance forthe whole population. This was more than a ^dical paradigm. Shoe stores, for example, used X ray machines for shoe fittings without any kind of protection from radioactivty. fig.41 The machines were not banned inthe United States untilthe 1970s.X rays had evolved from being radical images representing the hidden truth of things to become almost routine elements of everyday life. At exactly the same time, everything, not just the house, all of a sudden needed to be see through: from Pyrex cookware and Saran Wrap to windows in ovens and washing machines that expose their contents. figs.42,43 Likewise, everything had to be subjected to X rays\u2014even cars, as in a 1946 image of a Jeep featured in Life magazine as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Biggest X Ray\"30 fig.4s and appropriated by the Independent Group to be used in the exhibition \u201cParallel of Life and Art\" at the Institute ofContemporaryArts in London in 1953. The front cover of the catalogue of this exhibition was a 1941 X ray image of a man using an electric shaver, taken from Laszlo Moholy Nagy\u2019s 1947 book Vision in Motion, where it is described as the work of T:wo doctors in a New Jersey laboratory. fig.44 The image hc;d been published in Mechanix Illustrated, which is where Moholy Nagy found it.

March 25. 1946 46 Stills from Highlights ond Shadows byJames Sibley Watson, Jr., Kodak, 1937 46 Wendingen magazine. Infact, architectural magazines had an eye on X ray images from early on. It is as if X rays had steadily infiltrated and transformed diverse popular, profes sional,scientific, and artistic discourses\u2014virally expanding from a new way of seejng the world to a new world, from diagnosis to symptom, or even as generator of symptoms. GLASSTERROR The association between X rays and glass houses became commonplace in midcentury popular culture. For example, in Highlights and Shadows, a 1937 Kodak Research Laboratories film on the virtues of X rays for disease prevention by the filmmaker radiographer James Sibley Watson, Jr., a woman wearing a swimsuit is shown strapped to a laboratory table while her body is subjected to X rays. As her photographic image gives way to the image of her X rayed body, the narrator declares: \u201cThis young lady, to whom henceforth a glass house should hold no terrors, will after an examination of her radiographs, be reassured that she is indeed physically fit.\u201c31 fig.46 The glass house acted as a symbol of both the newform of surveillanceand health. A similar set of associations can be found in the discoursesurrounding canonical worksofmodern architecture. In an interview in House Beautiful, Edith Farnsworth, a successful doctor in Chicago, compared her famous weekend house, designed by Mies in 1949,to an X ray: I don't keep a garbage can under my sink. Do you know why? Becauseyou can seethe whole\u201ckitchen\"from the X Ray Intimacy 145 47 road on the way in here and the can would spoil the appearance ofthe whole house. So I hide it in the closet further down from the sink. Mies talks about \u201cfree space\": but his space is very fixed. I can't even put a clothes hanger in myhousewithoutconsidering how it affects everything from the outside. Any arrangement of furniture becomes a major problem, because the house is transparent, like an X ray.35 F1G5.47,4B 47 Mies van derRohe.

While the house was for Farnsworth likean X ray, the nearby village thoughtofthewhite building full of glass as a sanatorium. Farnsworth goes on to claim: \u201cThere is already the local rumor that it\u2019s a tuberculosis sanatorium.\u201d33 The association was not accidental. Modern arch itec ture not only thought of itself as providing sanatorium conditions for everyday life, but even thought of buildings as diagnostic instruments with the power of an X ray. As Le Corbusier already had put it in L'Art d\u00e9coratif d'aujourd'hui in 1925: \u201cIf the house is all white... everything stands out from it and is recorded absolutely, black on white, it is honest and dependable.... I t is rather like an X ray of beauty.^ The metaphor of the X ray was not accidental, either. Diagnosis of tuberculosis continued to be difficult in the 1920s. Physicians often confused it with other illnesses, including bronchitis, chronic indigestion, malaria, neurasthenia, and typhoid fever. To evaluate the condition, they needed to see inside the body. X ray technology, which had 146 49 50 VICTOR ROENTGEN STAN() Mo:elJ been available in sanatoriums since the beginning of the centujy, became by the 1920s a routine part oftheexamina tion of those with visible symptoms. Screening the body for tuberculosis meant optically penetrating areas of the body previously invisible. X rays created a new kind of vision, a new paradigm of the inside/outside relationship. hlothing could havebeen more architectural The discourse about transparency in modern architecture is an echo of the discourse about transparency that was part of Rontgen\u2019s first scientific paper announcing the discovery of X rays in 1895 and immediately captivating the popular imagination.The abilityto see through material challenged all assumptions and social protocols about privacy and psychological well being and therefore all architectural concepts of shelter and comfort. Everyone became a permanent patient in need of a new kind of medical domesticity. The intrusive logic of medical and police surveillance, with the body unable to resista newly penetrating gaze, gave way to a tender intimacy. The attempt to disci plinethe body\u2014with a new regime of synchronized medical, technological, and architectural protocols\u2014also produced new psychological, social, philosophical, and emotional interactionsto which architects responded. FIG5.49 S1 Just as the X ray exposes the inside of the bodytothe public eye, the modern building exposed its interior. What was previously private is now subjected to public scrutiny. But the X ray is not simply an image of the body. It is an image of the body being imaged. The X ray is not simply about showingan inside. The exterior envelope is still a kind X Ray Intimacy 147 51 Winningmodels Marianne Baba (left), Lois Conway (center) and Ruth Swensen (right)standing next to plates of their X rays during a chiropractor beauty contest, Life magazine.

To look at an X ray is to feel your eye penetrating the surface ofthe body.The very act of lookingis exposed.You feel the eye moving through space. It is inevitably voyeuristic. Perhaps that\u2019s what attracted architectsto the X rays from the beginning. In glass architecture, the glass is never completely transparent. Even ; T. :l. you feel the outer limit ofthe building and your eye passingthrough thatlimit. You feel the exposure. Modern architecture exposes itself, but not by revealing everything. Rather, it stages the act ofexpo sure,callingthe eye in. The seemingly fragile cloudy space of the X ray becomes an architecture in its own right that can be inhabited and is inhabited. All the ostensible sharpness and clarity of modern architecture gives way to soft layers of reflections and translucencies. X ray architecture is an occupiableblur.

Space now \u201cfluctuates,\" as Gyorgy Kepes put it in his Language of Vision (1944): \u201cTransparencymeans a simultaneous perception ofdifferent spatial locations. Space not only recedes but fluctuates in a continuous activity.\"1 Forms \u201cinterpenetrate\" ambiguously without dissolving each othe.c,They vibrate, forcingthe brain of the viewer to speculate on what is there without ever being g.bleto pin things down.

I n Colin Rowe and Robert Slutzky\u2019s canonic reading of Kepes: \u201cBy definition. the trans parentceases to bethat which is perfectly clearand instead becomes that which is clearly ambiguous.\u201d2 For example, at first sight, the work of SANAA, the office of Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, appears as the perfect case of transparency in architecture and has been celebrated as such. ln this sense, SANAA has inherited the Miesian tradition of radical transparency, absorbing and refiningtheX rayeffect.Taketheir Glass Pavilion (2006) in theToledo Museum ofArt. fig. i an all glass pavilion for allglass objects in the \u201cGlassCity,\"Toledo, Ohio.

Butwhat really fascinated architects such as Mies and those inspired by him, such as Philip Johnson, was not the way the gaze passesthrough theglass, butthe way itseems to get caught in the layers of reflection. 151 152 1 SANAA, rendering of the Glass Pavilion at the Toledo MuseumofArt.Ohio, 2006 2 MiesvanderRohe,modelofFifty by Fifty House. 1951 1952 3 Reflections rnthe Glass House.

Complex lines of reflected trees become like the veins of marble in Mies's buildings. When explaining his Glass House, Johnson cited Mies' words from twenty five years earlier, when Mies said: \u201cI discovered by working with actu al glass models that the important thing is the play of reflections and not the effect of light and shadow. as in ordinary buildings.' Mies must have beer referring to the glass model of his Glass Skyscraper that he had repeatedly photographed in a garden in Berlin Fios.4,s before arriving at the few canonical images released in 1922 that quickly went viral internationally in architectu ral magazines and books. It is hard to find an avant garde magazine that didn't include at least one of the images. Most professional magazines feature them, as does every book on modern architectu re. Not by chance, they are theopening images of Arthur Korn\u2019s 1929 book Glos im Bou. The images rapidly became an icon of modernity itself. The eye is pulled into the center of the image, through the glass to the skeleton, but the skeleton is not crystal clear. It is a kind of amorphous, murky presence.

In fact, their work appears to be more interested in further blurring the view, softening the focus, fig.is than in sustaining the supposed transparency of early avant garde architecture. Within SANAA's architecture, structure is never revealed. Their buildings are optical devices without any visible mecha nisms.The real view is not just from the outside looking in or the inside looking out, it is from the inside looking even further inward, not to discover the inrer secret of the building, butto be suspended in the view tself. The visitors are often literally between walls of glass or acrylic. What they see,through the shiny layer in front ofthem, is another layer and then another and then another, with the juxtaposed reflections off each surface dissolving any line between inside and outside. Peering through all the layers, vision softens and distorts,withthe cu rves and ripples of the glass accentuating thedistortion.FIG.n IfSANAA is the inheritor of Miesian transparency, the latest in a long line of experiments, they are the ultimate Blurred Visions 157 18 19 mtmrnkm 158 SANAA i b Rendering of the Glass Pavilion at the Toledo Museum ofArt> Ohio, 2006 19 Rendering of Lumiere Park Caf\u00e9, Almere, the Netherlands, 1999 20 'Transpar\u00e9ncia nipona,\"clipping from Newspaper Avui, Barcelona,dune 14,2010 Miesians, leaping beyond his investigation of transparency into a whole new kind of mirage effect. After centuries of architecture organized by the straight lines of the viewing eye, we now have an architecture formed by the soft distortions of the gaze\u2014a more tactile experience of vision. To enter a SANAA project is to be caressed by a subtle soften mg or the territory. Even the reflections of trees in thg outer layer of glass have a delicacy that one does not find in M ies \u25a0s Transparencia nipona work, whether in the renderings or the one to one scale models fis. is With such a tactile sense of vision, models are crucial. In the working of the studio, countless models are made of every possible solution in order that the effects can be felt before being fixed in a drawing. Indeed, SANAA seeks variations whose effects are unclear. As they put it in an interview: \u201cWe try not to select options for which we can already imagine the outcome.\u201c8 Theirs is an architecture of deliberately unclear vision, fig.i9 Mies\u2019s experiments in the garden to see the shift in what is seen get multiplied. The lack of transparency of glass is used to expose glass that exposes glass in a kind of vertigo of vision. SANAA.\u2019s architecture is not so much layerings of glass and acrylic as layerings of opacity\u2014 blurs, ratherthan lines.

The installation carefully marks off a part of the pavilion with an acrylic curtain acting as a kind of crime scene tape, leaving, as SANAA put it \u201cthe existing space of the Barcelona Pavilion undisturbed.\u201d And yet a completely new atmosphere was created. We decided to use acrylic to make transparent curtains. We imagined an installation design that leaves the existing space of the Barcelona Pavilion undisturbed. The acrylic curtain stands freely on the floor and is shaped in a calm spiral. The curtain softly encompasses the spaces within the pavilion and creates a new atmosphere. The view through the acrylic will be something different from the original with soft reflections slightly distorting the pav lion.9 FIG.22 But what crime has been committed here?

Just as Mies narrowed the entrance down, subtly constraining the visitor with a folded path, SANAA spins and squeezes the visitor between the narrow planes of acrylic that curve around until suddenly one is inside, facing the two Barcelona chairs or rather, the chairs are facing us, as if the king and queen were still there, sitting down, presiding over everything. There is a newchair, as iffor us.Itis theSANAA plywood chair with two asymmetrical bunny ears: fig.23 whimsical, childlike, fragile, uncomfortable, funny\u2014a kind of inexpensive school or cafeteria chair facing the wide, ceremonial, orthogonal, plush, leather and chrome chairs of Mies as in some kind of playful challenge. Another bunny chair is placed outside the acrylic curtain, behind the Barcelona chairs, as if guarding the crime scene. The new chair represents SANAA just as much as the old one represents Mies. The bunny belongs to the acrylic curve, while the Barcelona belongs to the onyx plane. As with Mies, is the new chair for sitting in and looking from? Or is it what is looked at: a solitary object suspended in the play of reflections, as unattainable as a royal appointment? Or is it the inexpensive, antiaristocratic chair, a subversive objectthat has infiltrated the luxury space? Or is it some kind of prisoner ofthe spiral? Or a kind of calling card left by SANAA? In any case, therole of Mies\u2019s heavyfurniture in lightof hisblurringof the visual field is called into question. Each chair is like a kind 162 of ship floating in the liquid reflections of the shiny floor, walls, and glass. X ray vision surely means a shift in the status of objects. SANAA turns the pavilion itself into a ready made object, even a piece of furniture, that can now be seen differently. But what does SANAA mean when they say that the space of the pavilion is left Undisturbed\"? Something has changed. In fact, everything seems to have changed. The simple spiral makes a new pavilion out of the old one\u2014a pavilion inside a pavilion, each transforming the other to produce a whole new architecture. The most famous pavilion of the twentieth century becomes something far from itself, but contained within itself. All the classic images imbedded in the brain ofevery architect now have additional layers of reflections. fib.2* SANAA returns the curtain to the pavilion\u2014or is it the pavilion to the curtain? The acrylic freestanding curtain recalls the Velvet and Silk Caf\u00e9, figz the brilliant collaborative work of Lilly Reich and Mies for the Exposition de la Mode in Berlin, two years before Barcelona,where draperies in black, orange, and red velvet and black and yellow lemon silk hung from metal rods to form the space. In its radical approach to defining the space by suspending sensuous surfaces, the caf\u00e9 was a kind of prototype ofthe pavilion. In the pavilion, the richly veined onyx surfaces took over the role of the curtains\u2014the hard surfaces absorbing softness. In fact, Mies pretended that they were curtains, denying their structural role, even if we now know better.

Thatthewalls are curtains may also explain why we don\u2019t enter the Barcelona Pavilion frontally, but at an angle, as if enteringfrom backstage. SANAA's project reminds us that the Barcelona Pavilion comes from curtains, from a soft material. The beginnings of architecture were textile. It is a Semperian idea of architecture, beautifully adopted by Adolf Loos, who wrote: The architect\u2019s general task isto provide a warm and livable space.Carpets are warm and livable.Hedecides for this reason to spread one carpet on thefloor and to hang up four to form the four walls. But you cannot build a house out of carpets. Both the carpet on the floor and the tapestry on the wall require a structural frame to hold them in the correct place.To invent this frame isthe architect\u2019s second task.10 The space that SANAA has wrapped with the new transparent curtain is precisely the centerofthe pavilion, the throne room with its poignantlyempty chairs for the king and queen of Spain. In old photographs, the space is marked by a black carpet on thefloor, which nobody dares to step on\u2014as in the image of the mysterious woman (is it Lilly Reich?) fig.29 sta nd ing outside its border, her back to the camera, looking in. SANAA\u2019s curtain is the invisible cloak that further protects that space\u2014a kind of royal transparent cloak. fig.3o The garment moves. It billows outward, allowi ng us toenter between its folds. Space is defined in a kind of invisible movement, 166 neither limited nor unlimited, a paradox that the spiral has alwayscommunicated. \u201cMy house,\" writes Georges Spyridaki, \u201cis diaphanous, butit is not ofgla,ss. It.is moreofthe nature ofvapor. Its walls contract and expand as I desire. Attimes, I draw them close about me Uke protective armor...> But at others, I let the walls of my house blossom out in their own space, which is infinitely extensible.\u201d Spyridaki's house breathes. First it is a coat of armor, then it extends ad infinitum, which amounts to saying that we live in it in alternate security and adventure. It is both cell and world. Here geometry is transcended11 SANAA's diaphanous curtain preserves the pavilion by allowing it to breathe. It is a kind a life support in a moment in which the subtlety of Mies\u2019s pavilion might so easily be forgotten precisely because the building is so insistently celebrated.The single curtain slows us down, allowing usto enter the pavilion again, as if on the day of its opening. fio.28 Once again, the factthat Mies and Reich did so little, when asked so much (represent Germany in Barcelona), can be appreciated. Yet what allows SANAA to take us back, or to bring the pavilion again forward toward us, is that the curtain is precisely not transparent. What is added is not a clear window or a magnifying glass, but a delicate veil. SANAA's acrylic, like their glass, is never neutral. The modern discourse of X rays\u2014cutting through the outer layers to reveal secrets\u2014gives way to inner translu Blurred Visions 167 31 Philip Johnson'3 Glass House in the snow, Mew Canaan, Connecticut,1949 32 Miesvan der Rohe.Farnsworth House flooded, 1950 1951 cent layers, endlessly folded and overlapping, intensifying the mystery, rather than removingit.The X ray logi c absorbed by modern architecture culminates in a dense cloud, of ghostly shapes.

With the acrylic curtain in Barcelona, the ghost is unambiguously modern architecture, preserved, rather than transformed, by subtle deflections. It. is the disturbance that allows things to returnto us undisturbed.

In one of the most evocative accounts of the Glass House, Johnson describes it as a \u201ccelestial elevator in which when it snows, you seem to be going up becauseeverything is coming down.\"12 fig.31 The house levitates in the snow, but remains a box. SANAA's glass pavilions are permanently in a storm, as if producing their own weather. Theirs is a more oceanic view, a liquid architecture. It is not by chance that lately, their own language also expresses this feeling. I n the La Samaritai ne project, they describethe \u201csoft waves ofthe glass\"; in Nishizawa\u2019s Office Building in Hatsudai, the \u201cundulating mesh\"; in Louvre Lens, the play of reflections that \u201callows the building to dissolve in its surroundings\" and the glassfoyerthat allowsthepark\u201ctoflowthroughthestructure.\" In reverse. the interior is \u201cspilling outside, blurring the bound ariesof the museum itself.^2 Everyth irgbecomes liquid. 168 31 12 Liquidity was already part ofthe modern project. Inhis book on Mies accompanying the 1947 exhibition at MoMA, Johnson described the Farnsworth House type as a \u201cfloating self contained cage.\"14 fig.32 He later used the same metaphor for his 6wn house. describing it as floating on the sea, even ifhe apparently hated the sea:\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like theseaside.There\u2019s nothingtbere,unless it\u2019s a boat. fthere's a boat, it's O.K.

But I say there\u2019s nothing there.\"15 The glass houses of Mies and Johnson are sealed floating boxes. A SANAA building is \u201cporous.\" It is no longer a sealed box onthe move. It breathes. Ereathing this is what was missing in Mies\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s glass houses, which in the summer had to leave the doors open to let fresh air in, even ifthe mosquitoes also camein,because screenswould spoil the effect. SANAA loves screens, filters, slits, membranes, curtains, mesh. The flows are not just optical. One breathes the landscape. The building \u201cdissolves in its surrounding,\u201d absorbing \u201cthe colors of the sky and vegetation, its appearance changing with the season and the time of theday\"16 BUT WHY IS ARCHITECTURE DISAPPEARING? The light footprints of Le Corbusier's pilotis, of Mies\u2019s glass walls, of thin walls, big windows, roof gardens, and so on have given wayto ever more ethereal structures. Junya lshi gami, for example, not by chance coming out of the SANAA Blurred Visions 169 studio, takes this dissolution to the extreme by imagining a barely visible architecture of the most delicate threads. Has this dematerialization ofarchitecturetodowith aworld increasingly mediatized? Old media made modern architecture modern.17 New media makes it disappear. With the X ray and glass architecture, the most inner secrets of our bodies and private life were exposed in public. Kodak understood this new paradigm. Their 1937 film Highlights and Shadows implied that there was nothing to fear in glass houses. The X ray had acclimatized us to living in a new, mediated condition. The threshold of the private was no longer the outside limit of a building. It had relocated. Privacy was now, paradoxically, established in public, some thingthat isalltooobvioustoday with theuseofacell phone, for example, to create an intimate space in the heart of a public space, or in the opposite direction, projecting from the supposed privacy of the interior, or even the bed, the most intimate detailsofone\u2019s life to a widerand wider audience through social medial\u00aeThe most inner secrets of our bodies, movements, sexuality, medical histories. domestic life, and finances are now public. The X ray effect has migrated toall dimensions ofcontemporary life. The role of architecture is once again chal enged. In aworld ofextreme exposure in which walls no longer offer privacy, new strategies emerge by entering the mechanisms of exposure to find the blind spots. 170 1 Gyorgy Kepes.

Blurred Visions 171 CHAPTER5 Hyperpublic: An Afterword At the turn of the twenty first century, the CAT scan (Computerized Axial Tomography), also known as CT (Computed Tomography) may have been for architects what the basic X ray was early in the twentieth century. Like the X ray, the CAT scan is n'otan image of.the body, but ofthe body being imaged: In fact, the CAT scan (invented in 1972 and widely available in hospitals since '980)1 is simply multiple X ray images compiled by a computer to generate cross sectional views and three dimensional images ofthe body\u2019s internal organs.Theword \u201ctomography\"comes from the Greektomos, meaning \u201cslice\" or \u201csection\" and graphia, meaning \u201cwriting\" and \u201cdrawing,\" as in the word \u201cphotography,\u201d meaning \u201cdrawing with light.\u201d UnlikeX rays,the CT makes visible hard and soft tissues insidethe body. A large donut shaped machine takes X rays at many different angles around the body as the body, lying horizontal, is moved slowly through the apparatus. fig. 1 The camera effectively spirals around the whole body. A typical medical brochure describes the procedure thus: \u201cImagine the body as a loaf of bread and you are looking at one end of the loaf. As you remove each slice of bread, you can see the entire surface of that slice from the crust to the center.\" The crust, skin, or envelope has become an almost invisible line. What matters is the dense interior, which is rendered like a new, more complex kind of facade. As with the X ray, architects were quick to respond to the new technology. While architectural publications from the beginning to the middle ofthe twentieth century were full of X rays\u2014from Mies and Le Corbusier to Alison and Peter Smithson\u2014and their architecture reflects this 1 CAT scan section, from patient's brochure, ca. 1999 173 174 5 6 2 Greg Lynn, Embryonic Space, ca.1998 3 Page from UN Studio, MOVE Vol. 2, 1999, showing photographs of fetuses i n different states of development 4 Page from UN Stud io.

But he must never m ummify an orga nism that lived once.\u201d2 Likewjse, UN Studio showed CAT scans of the brain alongside their projects in their 1999 book Move.3 fig.4 The Renaissance obsession with the brain continued into the twenty first century, as did interest in the fetus, as evidenced by the \u201cembryological\" work done by so called \u201cdigital archite cts > Has.*,3This new generation of architects, emerging in the late 1990s, started to produce experimental work under the influence of computer assisted technologies that allowed complete three dimensional modelingof the inside of the body. Not by chance, these architects were also fascinated by another medical procedure that parallels the scan, the Visible Human Project, FIG.s completed in 1995, which acts out physically the operation of the CAT scan, cutting a body in one millimeter sections, which are then used to generate an animation moving steadily through the whole body.Just as with the Renaissance dissect io ns, the invaded male body is that of a criminal, who in this case donated his body to science. The female dono' remains anonymous. Architecture has always referenced the medical body, but the human body now is a digital artifact in its own right. experienced from the inside and generating new kinds of thinking about the interior. Hyperpublic: An Afterword 175 8 The influence of the CAT scan and of the MRI scan, invented a few years later to provide more detail of soft tissue, is reflected in architectural envelopes. In the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale competition entry of 1989 by OMA (Office for Metropolitan Architecture), figs.7 9 the Miesian exposure of a s keleton behind a glass skin gives way to translucent bodies, revealing organs as inan MRI, without any visible envelope. The winning entry by FOA (Fore gn Office Architecture) in the Yokohama PortTerminal\u2019s co mpetition of 1995, on the other hand, seems to follow the logic of the CAT scan: fig.io an endless series of section cuts was used to assemble a three dimensional body that can be thought of as e ither all envelope or no envelope. fig.h There is no simple opposition between the outside and the inside. Its dream is to be a c ontinuously folded surface where structure and skin are one and where there are no bones or discrete organs. fig.12 When Alejandro Zaera Polo interviewed Frank Gehry\u2019s team in 1995, he asked where they had obtained the 3 D digitizers that were in use in the office, and they answered that they were originally used for guidinglasers i n brain surgery.5 The state of the art medical technology was being used in an architectural studio to generate 3 D models on the computer. A series of 3 D po ints is taken from the physical model, and the computer interpolates the surfaces between them to build the precise geometry of the building. The model is treated like a body about to be operated on, rebu ilt through a kind of plastic surgery. Today, there are new instruments of medical diagnosis, new systems of representation.

Like the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage, fig.is starring Raquel Welch, in which a team of scientists is shrunk and injected into the body to repair a brain inju ry, the M2A transforms the body into an occupiable interior. The body is turned inside out, making the skin irrelevant. All that remains is an endLess interior, bathed in the light from the little capsule\u2019s video camera. The capsule itself looks like 178 t3,t4 M2Acapsule endoscope is Still from Richard Fleischer (director). Foolo5tc^llo)'lge. 1966 a hybrid of the buildings inspired by X rays and CAT scans. A translucent envelope exposes the outlines of the inner mechanisms, while a transparent head acts as the viewing apparatus. This hybrid displaces both the transparent and translucent systems iQ favor of the skinless body, one no longer even experienced as a body. All this is somehow reminiscent of Frederick Kiesler, and it is not by chance that so many \u201cdigital architects\u201c have echoed his fluid geometries, and in particular, his Endless House, which Heexplicitly understood asa digestive system, giving architectural form to the first mouth to anus system. But with Kiesler and with much of the computer generated architecture of the turn of the twenty first century, the skin is turned into the structure. the whole building becoming a kind of flowing, self supporting skin, a hyperenvelope. What the M 2A camera creates, on theother hand, isthe possibility of the radically skinless body, the skinless building, the building turned completely inside out to such an extent that it maynot be clear that it is a building. Whatexa ctly this complete loss ofthe envelope means forarchitecture is unclear, but in an age in which the public/ private distinction has been so radically dissolved, an architecture without envelope may very we.l be upon us. Privacy is increasingly defined by a kind of blur within a hyperpublic space. The intentional olurring of the airport scan that strips the outer layer of clothing away to look for hidden weapons or contraband is supposed to protect those worried about the loss of privacy. Privacy is no longer established bya line but by a blurring withinthe most public space, Hyperpublic; An Afterword 16 Fo ward looking infrared radar (FUR) and one can hidefor a while within that blur. This blur might be treated as a kind of space, a new kind of interior that can be designed. The space of the airport is no longer defined by the building, but by the layers of surveillance machines that carveout a new kind ofspace,a seemingly public space that can be occupied only by surrendering private information about the body, bank account, history, movements, employment, family, and friends. The scarner that: literally acts as the doorway is reinforced by explosives sniffers, retina scans, heat sensors looking at the face for evidence of contagion, facial recognition software, fingerprinting, and so on. The body does not simply pass through an airport, but through multiple devices and through the space of data. Architecture is increasingly defined by these new instruments for looking, being looked at, and looked into. Multiple descendants of the X ray machine are dispersed through the contemporary city, patrolling and defining the limits of existing architecture, but also defining new architectures. Today, new forms of advanced surveillance technologies operate in the city, and these models of vision act as the new paradigms for transparency. Hand held scanning devices capable of seeing through clothing, walls, and buildings are in use by the military and, increasingly, also bythe police. These devices effectively make solid walls behave like glass. and they open up the possibility, even the inevitability, of new kinds of architectural experiments. Forward looking infrared radar (FUR), for example, detects the electromagnetic frequencies at which heat 180 radiates from organisms and structures, exposing heat emitting bodies. fig. is Seemingly solid walls no longer offer privacy. Indeed, FUR scans reveal activities that have already finished. One can be exposed even after one has left, because heat signatures remain for a while.This time delay is incorporated into a new kind ofvision. Bodies are treated the same as buildings.Just a s theairport scanners strip the body, the KAYA lens fitter that can be attached to a regular camera or even a cell phone camera can see through clothing by concentrating on the infrared spectrum. These technologies are controversial. The backscatter X ray machines installed in all US airports were removed a few years later because of the failure to blur the images of naked citizens, and the use of passive millimeter imaging (PMI) machines instead has been restricted to the production of a cartoon image ofthe body dueto the privacy concerns. fig.17 The midcentury fear of loss of privacy in the glass house and with the X ray has reappeared. It seems as if each new technology that exposes something private is perceived as threatening, then quickly absorbed into everyday life. The fear of the glass box or X ray seems quaint today. Even the grainy images of video surveillance cameras seem less invasive now, almost reassuring. Perhaps today\u2019s scanning technologies will also seem quaint inthefuture as each new technology delves deeper and deeper into the private. With each new invasion, our definition of \u201cprivate\" changes. All of these shifts in the technologies of viewing take their meaning relative to the massive levels of personal exposure through data mining today. Not only is the m ost HyperpubliciAnAfterword private information transiting through vast networks and being mined by companiesand governments,buttheprivate itself is now staged in a hyperpublic. The line between private and public is no longe'r drawn around a body,a relationship. a social group, or a buildin. Rather, it is drawn in the space of data, with multiple forms of privacy continuously established and violated. The body itself is now suspended in data. The medical body around which architecture has alwaysorganized itself is at onceflesh and information. The point of this small book is simply to show that in changing our definitions of public and private, the new medical technologiesthat emerged in the early years ofthe Last century changed our understanding of architecture. The question now is not how transparency is dislocated into other fields, or how architecture affects other fields, but how architecture absorbs transformations of public and private and reflects on those transformations. \u201cEvery age has its signature afflictions,\" Byung Chul Han writes in The Burnout Society:6 We can now add that each affliction has its architecture. The age of bacterial diseases\u2014particularly tuberculosis\u2014gave birth to modern architecture^ white buildings detached from the \u201chumid ground where disease breeds,\" as Le Corbusier had put it,7 smooth surfaces, big windows, and terraces to facilitate taking the sun and fresh air cure. When the discoveryofanti biotics put an end to that age, in the postwar years, attention shifted to psychological problems. The same architects once concerned with the prevention of tuberculosis became 182 obsessed with the psyche, with the house seen as not just a medical devicefor the prevention of disease, but as a way to provide psychological comfort, what Neutra called \u201cnervous health\u201dswith the architect as a psychologist. The tw\u00e8nty first pentury, according to Han, is the age of neurological disorders: depression, ADH D, borderline personality disorders, and burnQLJt syndrome. What is the architecture of.these afflictions? Not by chance the turn of the twenty first century is also the age of the sick building syndrome, in which modern buildings turn on their occupants, literally rendering them unhealthy. It is the age of allergies, the age of the \"environmentally hypersensitive\" unable to live in the modern world and its buildings. Never at any one time in history have there been so many people allergic to chemicals, buildings, electromagnetic fields (EMF), fragrances.... Since the environment is now almost completely man made, we have become allergic to ourselves, to our own hyperextended body in a kind of autoimmunedisorde. What do these developments mean for design? Architecture finds itself increasingly unable to present itself as a cure. Escapingarchitecture becomes the only architectural strategy. There are communities of the afflicted living in a kind of replay ofthe 1960s in bubbles, tents, and old cars that have been \"cleaned\"of alltoxic materials, usually inthe desert or far away from civilization nomads moving at the very sniff of a chemical coming from a shifting wind that brings \u201cwhiffs of industry, detergent, fabric softener, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides... exhaust from cars,\" as Oodie Bellamy puts it in \u201cWhen the Sick Rulethe Wortd.\"9 Hyperpublrc: An Afterword Implied in all ofthis is a different city\u2014and new questions for design, orveryancient questions about the limits of the body and mind, and how to take shelter in a threatening world.The correlation of architecture with the medical body has finally come full circle with the rise of the \u201csick building syndrome.\" The type of architecture that was meant to inoculate its occupants against disease has become a source of disease. We are becomi ng physically allergic to buildings. New bodies will probably have to be designed. A new theory of architecture is likelyto follow. 1 Computer Tomography (CD was invented in 1972 by two people working independently; British engineer Godfrey Hounsfield of EMI Laboratories, England, and South Africa born physicist Allan CormackofTufts University, Massachusetts.Hounsfield andCormack were later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their contributionsto medicine and science. 2 Josep Uuis Mateo\u2014MAPArchitects (Barcelona; Oragados yConstrucciones, 1991), exh.cat.

Image Credits 197 Acknowledgments With a project of such long duration, I feel indebted intellectually and emotionallyto many people and institutions. I am grateful to the New York Institute for the Humanities, my first host in New York an'd where this project was incubated\u2014even if then abandoned for a longtime. I am grateful to Richard Sennett for his generosity as director, inviting me to the Institute as a research scholar, and to the fellows of 1980 81, particularly Susan Sontag, Wolfgang Schivelbusch, and Carl Schorske for their profound inspiration. I could neversee architecturethe same way again. In the long hiatus where I tried to suppress this project, several people and institutions invited me to speak and write about the question, unwittingly keeping the flame alive.They include Werne r Oechslin, Cynthia Davidson, BernardTschumi, Stephan Tr\u00fcby, Andrea Phitlips, Detlef Mertins, Sylvia Lavin, Antoine Picon, Jennifer Sigler, Brett Steele, Andrea Simitch, Carolyn Christov Bakargiev, and Nikolaus Hirsch. TheAmerican Academy in Berlin, where I was a fellow in the fall of 2014, provided the ideal setting to revive this project, which continued atthe Getty Center in Los Angeles in the spring of 2015. I am immensely grateful to the feedback of the fellows and their partners at both institutions, particularly Anthony McCall, Annabelle McCall, Myles Jackson, DanielEisenberg, Ellen Rothenberg, MonicaBlack,Adam Ross,Tacita Dean, Mathew Hale, Thordis Arrhenius,Thomas Hines, Katja M\u00fcller Helle, and Carolyn Christov Bakargiev. Back in theforests of Berlin and again atthe edge the water, as a 2018 19 fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, has been the perfect placeto complete this book. 198 Generous support for the research and publication was provided by the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts and the Barr Ferree Foundation Publication Fund, Department of Art and Archeology, Princeton University. ' . . l am grateful to Bud Bynack for his subtle editing and to Bart Jan Polman and.Esther Choi for their hglp with the index. and the image sourcing respectively. It. has been a pleasure to work again with Lars M\u00fcller, \u201cthe last bookmaker,\" and liis team. I am particularly thankful to Maya R\u00fcegg for the careful coordination and to Martina Mullis and Lars forthedesign. Special thanks to my colleagues and friends for their support, particularly Giuliana Bruno, Jean Louis Cohen, Elizabeth Diller, Hal Foster, Alice Friedman, Sarah Herda, Francesca Hughes, Sylvia Lavin, Dietrich Neumann, Felicity Scott, and Tony Vidler. I am especially grateful to Monica Ponce de Leon, my colleagues, and the students at the School of Architecture at Princeton, who continuously create such an energizing academic environment. In the end, this book comes out of my teaching and the pleasure of testing ideas. Above all, I am super grateful to the non boring endless conversation with Mark Wigley aboutthese ideas.

        "It challenges the normal understanding of modern architecture by proposing that it was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time: tuberculosis and its primary diagnostic tool, the X ray.",
        "Modern architecture and the X ray were born around the same time and evolved in parallel.",
        "While the X ray exposed the inside of the body to the public eye, the modern building unveiled its interior, dramatically inverting the relationship between private and public.",
        "Architects presented their buildings as a kind of medical instrument for protecting and enhancing the body and psyche.",
        "Beatriz Colomina traces the psychopathologies of twentieth century architecture\u2014from the trauma of tuberculosis to more recent disorders such as burn out syndrome and ADHD\u2014and the huge transformations of privacy and publicity instigated by diagnostic tools from X Rays to MRIs and beyond.",
        "She suggests that if we want to talk about the state of architecture today, we should look to the dominant obsessions with illness and the latest techniques of imaging the body\u2014and ask what effects they have on the way we conceive architecture.",

        "It goes back at least to the year I arrived in New York, attheend of 1980,after studying architecture in Barcelona.",
        "Bysome impossibly good luck, I landed as a visiting'fellow at the NewYork Institute for the Humanities, then ru n by Richard Sennett, and with some extraordinary figures as senior fellows\u2014Carl Schorske, Wolfgang Schivelbusch, and Susan Sontag, among others.",
        "I was deeply attracted to the kind of interdisciplinary work they were doing.",
        "In particu lar, Sontag\u2019s///ness asMetaphor; which had recently been published, had an enormous influence on me.",
        "I started seeing modern architecture in terms of all the pathologies related to it, real or imagined\u2014agoraphobia, claustrophobia, nervous disorders, and, above all, tuberculosis and the obsession with hygiene,with germs,with fresh air....",
        "I thought this would be a great topic for my dissertation and actually wrote about one hundred pages on it in some kind of feverish state induced by my intoxication with New York.",
        "But there was not yet a climate for that kind of inter disciplinaryresearch in architecture\u2014not in Barcelona, and not at Columbia University, either, where I was a visiting scholar the following year.",
        "So I ended up working on two canonical figures, Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier, and the relationships between modern architecture and the emerging media of its time\u2014photography, illustrated magazines,film, 1 Susan Sontag, handwritten notes on and so on.",

        "Returning to the project on tuberculosis and modern architecture isfor me like tlie returnofthe repressed.",

        "I was planning to do something else.",
        "But or one of myfirst days atthe academy in Wannsee, I discovered that there had been several tuberculosis sanatoriums inthe area.",
        "The airthere was famously cleaner, and people from elsewhere in Berlin cameto Wannsee forthe cure.",
        "fig.3 So I decided, or perhaps it was decided for me, to change my topic and take up again this question that had been with me for such a long time.",
        "I nceed, that fall, I immediately imagined myself as a patient in a sanatorium taking the cure, alongwith all thewonderful,witty fellows and partners with their various ailments\u2014a feeling that made perfect sense of the academy\u2019s retired location, the lake, the fresh air,theterraces,theforest, the light, the extraordinary and abundant food, the great care of the team of professionals in the house, and the beautiful pavilion in the garden by the lake that Regine Leibinger and Frank Barkow had recently completed asa kind ofsun pavilion for the cure,FiG.4 where I wrote these lines.",

        "That year, the theme at the Ge:ty Research Institute was the canon of art history.",
        "There is today an ever more nuanced understanding of the canon in architecture, yet the central mythology of modern architecture remains remarkably intact after almost one hundred years\u2014perhaps because it was never true.",
        "Concealed within the standard narratives about modern architecture are other stories that have been forgotten or repressed.",
        "stories that energized and rationalized the work of the avant garde, but were pushed to the background in favor of a simplistic rhetoric oftechnical and visual efficiency.",
        "Reyner Banham, probably the first historian to challenge the mythology of modern architecture as functionalist, contrasted the way his teacher Nikolaus Pevsner could never escape the short list ofcanonical figures that he himself had canonized with Henry Russell Hitchcock's \u201cextracanonical\" vision,which picks upperipheraland unexpected figures and ideas.2 In these terms, I think of my research as \u201cintra canonical\"\u2014attentive to the unexpected within thecanon itself.",
        "And inthis case.the unexpected is disease.",
        "So what is this surprisingly resilient canonical view? Modern architecture, launched in the 1920s by an international group of avant garde architects, has usually introduction been understood in terms of functional efficiency, new materials (glass, iron, reinforced concrete), new technologies of construction, and the machine aesthetic.",
        "In contrast, the hypothesis of this book' is that modern architecture was shaped by the dominant medical obsession of its time\u2014 tuberculosis\u2014and the technology that became associated with it\u2014X rays.",
        "That technology produced a new and widespread change in the conception of space and the relation of inside to outside.",
        "This change can be understood as a specific historical event, a twentieth century twist in the ancient, intimate relationship between architecture and medicinethat is ongoing today.",
        "Just as medicaltechnologies and the treatment of illness played a major role in determining the characteristics of modern architecture.",
        "new medical technologies are today creating new forms of architecture as the relationship between inside and outside passes through another transformation.",
        "Yet we are still living in the architecture shaped by a specific disease,tuberculosis, and its primary diagnostic tool, the X ray.",
        "Modern architecture remains the default everyday environment, the norm produced by vast industrial systems, rather than the transgressive work of an avant garde inspired by a specific disease.",
        "It is as if the widespread success of modern architecture depended on its association with health, its internationalism the consequence of the global spread of the disease it was meantto resist.",
        "A map showing the distribution of modern architecture would echo a map of the distribution of the illness.",
        "Tuberculosis is fundamentally urban, as was modern architecture.",
        "One in seven people on the planet 10 died from it inthe nineteenth century, but in the city of Paris alone, it was close to one in three.",
        "Modernity was driven by illness.The engine of modern architecture was not a heroic, shiny, functional machine working its way acrossvthe globe, but a languid,fragile body suspended outside daily life in a protective cocoon of new technologies and geometries.",
        "It is the difficulty pf each breath and therefore' the treasure of each breath: the melancholy of modernity.",
        "Modern architecture is inseparable from an intimate, even romantic, relationship between a new kind of medical image and a new kind of space\u2014each intriguing and inspiring the other.",
        "The point here is not to pin this relationship down and ossify it, but to release it, to reactive it, to stimulate reflection by offering a kind of portrait at the intersection of biology, psychology, biography, sexuality, and technology to invite the reader to look again, to see modern architecturethrough different eyes.Whatdoes it mean when everyone\u2014the client, the architect, the theorist, the critic, the worker\u2014is a patient? 1 Some ofthe texts I published onthis theme include:\"Krankheit als Metapher inder modernen Architektur.\u2019Ooidolcs 64 (1997); \u201cThe Medical Body in Modern Architect ure,\u201c in Anybody.",

        "Architectural discourse weaves itself througl;l theories of body and brain, constructing the architect as a kind of doctor and the client as patient.",
        "Vitruvius in the first century BC launched Western architectural theory by insisting that all architects needed to study medicine: \"Healthfulness being their chief object.\"1 He devoted a large part of the first book of his Ten Books on Architecture to the question cf health, giving detailed instructions on how to determine the healthiness of a proposed site for a city by returning to the ancient method of sacrificing an animal that lives there and inspecting its liver to make sure it is \u201csound and firm.\" Likewise, for the healthy site of each building, he discusses the theory of the four humors and emphasizes the direction of the winds andthe sun.",

        "Like the X ray, the CAT scan is n'otan image of.the body, but ofthe body being imaged: In fact, the CAT scan (invented in 1972 and widely available in hospitals since '980)1 is simply multiple X ray images compiled by a computer to generate cross sectional views and three dimensional images ofthe body\u2019s internal organs.Theword \u201ctomography\"comes from the Greektomos, meaning \u201cslice\" or \u201csection\" and graphia, meaning \u201cwriting\" and \u201cdrawing,\" as in the word \u201cphotography,\u201d meaning \u201cdrawing with light.\u201d UnlikeX rays,the CT makes visible hard and soft tissues insidethe body.",

        "1 The camera effectively spirals around the whole body.",
        "A typical medical brochure describes the procedure thus: \u201cImagine the body as a loaf of bread and you are looking at one end of the loaf.",
        "As you remove each slice of bread, you can see the entire surface of that slice from the crust to the center.\" The crust, skin, or envelope has become an almost invisible line.",
        "What matters is the dense interior, which is rendered like a new, more complex kind of facade.",
        "As with the X ray, architects were quick to respond to the new technology.",
        "While architectural publications from the beginning to the middle ofthe twentieth century were full of X rays\u2014from Mies and Le Corbusier to Alison and Peter Smithson\u2014and their architecture reflects this 1 CAT scan section, from patient's brochure, ca.",

        "Not by chance, these architects were also fascinated by another medical procedure that parallels the scan, the Visible Human Project, FIG.s completed in 1995, which acts out physically the operation of the CAT scan, cutting a body in one millimeter sections, which are then used to generate an animation moving steadily through the whole body.Just as with the Renaissance dissect io ns, the invaded male body is that of a criminal, who in this case donated his body to science.",
