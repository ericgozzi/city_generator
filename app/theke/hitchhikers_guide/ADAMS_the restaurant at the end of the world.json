My wife also had a hangover and said she couldn\u2019t face it, so I rang Mike Palin and he said he had a hangover and couldn\u2019t face it. So then I rang Douglas Adams and he said he had a hangover and couldn\u2019t face it. So I prepared to sit for five hours on my own, watching a film I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to see. However, just as I was opening the front door to leave the house, the phone rang and it was Douglas, who said, \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and it seems such a terrible idea that I think I ought to do it.\u2019 Douglas wasn\u2019t afraid of ideas even if they seemed like bad ones. Indeed he was totally obsessed with the idea of ideas. Nobody, I suspect, reads the Hitchhiker books for their plot. Not many, I would suppose, read them for their characters (apart from Marvin). So why is it that we love these books so much? After all, if a novel doesn\u2019t have great characters or a compelling plot, why bother reading it? In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, there is an interlude in which the Ruler of the Universe talks to his cat about how we know we know anything or how we know what we perceive is what we are actually perceiving or is what is happening, and he concludes by saying, \u2018Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more likely.\u2019 And he pours himself a glass of whisky. It\u2019s one of those magical moments when Douglas\u2019s fascination with ideas comes to the fore. And it\u2019s those magical moments that I love in Douglas\u2019s writing. He\u2019s the only novelist I know who can make ideas a page turner. And The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is full of ideas. And humour. That\u2019s the other thing Douglas was so good at: making ideas not only interesting but funny. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy opines that every civilization goes through three stages: Survival, Enquiry and Sophistication \u2013 the how?, why? and where? stages. The Guide says: \u2018the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?\u2019 Then there is the wonderful concept of the A, B and C spaceships, in which all the people in Management, Accountancy, Advertising and Hairdressing are sent off in advance while the creative and productive people stay behind and somehow never make it into space... deliberately. When you look nowadays at the BBC or the National Health Service, you get the feeling that we all must have been on the B Ark. In fact, The Restaurant is full of slightly prophetic elements. The one that makes me shudder, at the edge of today\u2019s economic disaster, is the section where the settlers from the B Ark have made the leaf into legal tender \u2013 so money really does grow on trees. But they now realize that there is too much currency available and so, to remedy the situation in fiscal terms, they decide to burn down all the forests. So welcome to Douglas Adams\u2019s Rollercoaster of Ideas. Oh, and we had a great day at Abel Gance\u2019s Napol\u00e9on. It wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all. TERRY JONES Python and co author of Starship Titanic There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory which states that this has already happened. 1 The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This had made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle Six believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle Six and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. For instance, a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty two \u2013 and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet \u2013 especially by the strange ape like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program. And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. Sadly, however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way \u2013 so they claimed \u2013 for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. Or so it would seem. Two of these strange, ape like creatures survived. Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers. Tricia McMillan \u2013 or Trillian \u2013 had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. Two survivors. They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted \u2013 to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything. And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them. 2 Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protruded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside it and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born \u2013 or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born. In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn\u2019t even think once. They are simple minded, thick willed, slug brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry. One thing they don\u2019t like is leaving a job unfinished \u2013 particularly this Vogon, and particularly \u2013 for various reasons \u2013 this job. This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he it was who had had the job of demolishing the so called \u2018planet\u2019 Earth. He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned. It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard. Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. He had other fish to fry. It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words \u2018integrity\u2019 or \u2018moral rectitude\u2019 he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away. In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over. He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. \u2018Computer,\u2019 he croaked, \u2018get me my brain care specialist on the line.\u2019 Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as \u2018my private brain care specialist\u2019 there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy\u2019s most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?\u2019 The Vogon Captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. Halfrunt\u2019s smile did not flicker for an instant. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 rumbled the Vogon, \u2018is what you always say.\u2019 \u2018Well again,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of the mission?\u2019 \u2018We have located the ship.\u2019 \u2018Wonderful,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018wonderful! And the occupants?\u2019 \u2018The Earthman is there.\u2019 \u2018Excellent! And...?\u2019 \u2018A female from the same planet. They are the last.\u2019 \u2018Good, good,\u2019 beamed Halfrunt. \u2018Who else?\u2019 \u2018The man Prefect.\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018And Zaphod Beeblebrox.\u2019 For an instant Halfrunt\u2019s smile flickered. \u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I had been expecting this. It is most regrettable.\u2019 \u2018A personal friend?\u2019 enquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out. \u2018Ah, no,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018in my profession, you know, we do not make personal friends.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 grunted the Vogon, \u2018professional detachment.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Halfrunt cheerfully \u2018we just don\u2019t have the knack.\u2019 He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly. \u2018But Beeblebrox, you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018he is one of my most profitable clients. He has personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts.\u2019 He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. \u2018Still,\u2019 he said, \u2018you are ready for your task?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Good. Destroy the ship immediately.\u2019 \u2018What about Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Halfrunt brightly, \u2018Zaphod\u2019s just this guy, you know?\u2019 He vanished from the screen. The Vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew. \u2018Attack,\u2019 he said. At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship\u2019s computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the Improbability factors with a pencil. The Heart of Gold\u2019s Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn\u2019t do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen. He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it. He didn\u2019t know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it. He didn\u2019t know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be. He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains. He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time. At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry. \u2018Starpox!\u2019 he shouted. At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air. This was not because of anything wrong with the ship\u2019s artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stairwell which led to the ship\u2019s personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod\u2019s door and explained what was on his mind. \u2018Vogons,\u2019 he said. A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism, because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutri Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid which was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. He attempted to reason with the thing. \u2018Tea,\u2019 he said. \u2018Share and Enjoy,\u2019 the machine repeated and produced another one. \u2018Share and Enjoy\u2019 is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years. The motto stands \u2013 or rather stood \u2013 in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadraz. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives \u2013 now deceased. The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read \u2018Go stick your head in a pig\u2019, and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration. Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. \u2018Listen, you machine,\u2019 he said, \u2018you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?\u2019 \u2018Nutrition and pleasurable sense data,\u2019 burbled the machine. \u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018It tastes filthy!\u2019 \u2018If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink,\u2019 continued the machine, \u2018why not share it with your friends?\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 said Arthur tartly, \u2018I want to keep them. Will you try to comprehend what I\u2019m telling you? That drink...\u2019 \u2018That drink,\u2019 said the machine sweetly, \u2018was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018so I\u2019m a masochist on a diet, am I?\u2019 \u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up.\u2019 \u2018Will that be all?\u2019 Arthur decided to give up. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said. Then he decided he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d give up. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018look, it\u2019s very, very simple... all I want... is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen.\u2019 And he sat. He told the Nutri Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn\u2019t get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company. \u2018So that\u2019s it, is it?\u2019 said the Nutri Matic when he had finished. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that is what I want.\u2019 \u2018You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?\u2019 \u2018Er, yes. With milk.\u2019 \u2018Squirted out of a cow?\u2019 \u2018Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to need some help with this one,\u2019 said the machine tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business. \u2018Well, anything I can do,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018You\u2019ve done quite enough,\u2019 the Nutri Matic informed him. It summoned up the ship\u2019s computer. \u2018Hi there!\u2019 said the ship\u2019s computer. The Nutri Matic explained about tea to the ship\u2019s computer. The computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri Matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence. Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened. He thumped it, but still nothing happened. Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still. Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship. 3 \u2018Does anyone have a kettle?\u2019 Arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen. He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them. \u2018Hello?\u2019 he said. At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surface that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again. \u2018Something up?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Hey, didja hear that,\u2019 muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls on the Infinite Improbability Drive, \u2018the monkey spoke!\u2019 The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut out. \u2018Pure history, man,\u2019 said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive, \u2018a talking monkey!\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019re upset about something...\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Vogons!\u2019 snapped Ford. \u2018We\u2019re under attack!\u2019 Arthur gibbered. \u2018Well what are you doing? Let\u2019s get out of here!\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t. Computer\u2019s jammed.\u2019 \u2018Jammed?\u2019 \u2018It says all its circuits are occupied. There\u2019s no power anywhere in the ship.\u2019 Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back against the wall. \u2018Nothing we can do,\u2019 he said. He glared at nothing and bit his lip. When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment. A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow. He started to speak, and stopped. He started to speak again and stopped again. Finally he managed to speak. \u2018Er,\u2019 he said. He cleared his throat. \u2018Tell me,\u2019 he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen. \u2018Tell me,\u2019 he said again, \u2018did the computer say what was occupying it? I just ask out of interest...\u2019 Their eyes were riveted on him. \u2018And, er... well that\u2019s it really, just asking.\u2019 Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck. \u2018What have you done to it, Monkeyman?\u2019 he breathed. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018nothing in fact. It\u2019s just that I think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to...\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Make me some tea.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s right, guys,\u2019 the computer sang out suddenly, \u2018just coping with that problem right now, and wow, it\u2019s a biggy. Be with you in a while.\u2019 It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent. As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing. The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick force shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30 Megahurt Definit Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it wouldn\u2019t be around for long. Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it. \u2018Three minutes and fifty seconds,\u2019 he said a short while later. \u2018Forty five seconds,\u2019 he added at the appropriate time. He flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look. \u2018Dying for a cup of tea, eh?\u2019 he said. \u2018Three minutes and forty seconds.\u2019 \u2018Will you stop counting!\u2019 snarled Zaphod. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, \u2018in three minutes and thirty five seconds.\u2019 Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed Sub Cyclic Normality Assert i Tron to counter the Heart of Gold\u2019s Infinite Improbability Drive; but the Sub Cyclic Normality Assert i Tron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat there and took it. A dozen 30 Megahurt Definit Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it. He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found. He didn\u2019t know about the tea, of course. Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend. Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on. Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be avoided than harped upon. Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and, what\u2019s more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion. Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy. \u2018You want to talk to your great grandfather?\u2019 boggled Ford. \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Does it have to be now?\u2019 The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was rising. The light was getting dimmer \u2013 all the energy the computer didn\u2019t require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force field. \u2018Yeah!\u2019 insisted Zaphod. \u2018Listen, Ford, I think he may be able to help us.\u2019 \u2018Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care.\u2019 \u2018Suggest something else we can do.\u2019 \u2018Er, well...\u2019 \u2018OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian, Monkeyman, move.\u2019 They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third hand Zaphod turned off the lights. Darkness grabbed the ship. Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit Kil cannon continued to rip at the force field. \u2018Concentrate,\u2019 hissed Zaphod, \u2018on his name.\u2019 \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Concentrate!\u2019 \u2018The Fourth?\u2019 \u2018Yeah. Listen, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Now concentrate!\u2019 \u2018Three minutes,\u2019 said Ford Prefect. \u2018Why,\u2019 said Arthur Dent, \u2018are we doing this?\u2019 \u2018Shut up,\u2019 suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox. Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say? The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own. Round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it. They concentrated. Still they concentrated. And still they concentrated. The seconds ticked by. On Zaphod\u2019s brows stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, then of frustration and finally of embarrassment. At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch. \u2018Ah, I was beginning to think you\u2019d never turn the lights on,\u2019 said a voice. \u2018No, not too bright please, my eyes aren\u2019t what they once were.\u2019 Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place. \u2018Now. Who disturbs me at this time?\u2019 said the small, bent, gaunt figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge. His two small wispy haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, the other squinted sharply at them. If his eyes weren\u2019t what they once were, they must once have been diamond cutters. Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture of familiar respect. \u2018Oh... er, hi, Great grandad...\u2019 he breathed. The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great grandson. \u2018Ah,\u2019 he snapped, \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line. Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth.\u2019 \u2018The First.\u2019 \u2018The Nothingth,\u2019 spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul. He shifted awkwardly in his seat. \u2018Er, yeah,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Er, look, I\u2019m really sorry about the flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was fresh out of wreaths and...\u2019 \u2018You forgot!\u2019 snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the same.\u2019 \u2018Two minutes, Zaphod,\u2019 whispered Ford in an awed whisper. Zaphod fidgeted nervously. \u2018Yeah, but I did mean to send them,\u2019 he said. \u2018And I\u2019ll write to my great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this...\u2019 \u2018Your great grandmother,\u2019 mused the gaunt little figure to himself. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Er, how is she? Tell you what, I\u2019ll go and see her. But first we\u2019ve just got to...\u2019 \u2018Your late great grandmother and I are very well,\u2019 rasped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. \u2018Ah. Oh.\u2019 \u2018But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well...\u2019 Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation, and Ford\u2019s heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the shaking had reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and Arthur\u2019s faces white and unblinking in the gloom. \u2018Er, Great grandfather...\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve been following your progress with considerable despondency...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, look, just at the moment, you see...\u2019 \u2018Not to say contempt!\u2019 \u2018Could you sort of listen for a moment...\u2019 \u2018I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m being attacked by a Vogon fleet!\u2019 cried Zaphod. It was an exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across. \u2018Doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least,\u2019 said the little old figure with a shrug. \u2018Only it\u2019s happening right now, you see,\u2019 insisted Zaphod feverishly. The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had brought in and looked at it with interest. \u2018Er... Great grandad...\u2019 \u2018Did you know,\u2019 interrupted the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod with a stern look, \u2018that Betelgeuse Five has now developed a very slight eccentricity in its orbit?\u2019 Zaphod didn\u2019t and found the information hard to concentrate on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on. \u2018Er, no... look,\u2019 he said. \u2018Me spinning in my grave!\u2019 barked the ancestor. He slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering, stick like see through finger at Zaphod. \u2018Your fault!\u2019 he screeched. \u2018One minute thirty,\u2019 muttered Ford, his head in his hands. \u2018Yeah, look Great grandad, can you actually, help because...\u2019 \u2018Help?\u2019 exclaimed the old man as if he\u2019d been asked for a stoat. \u2018Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise...\u2019 \u2018Help!\u2019 repeated the old man as if he\u2019d been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed. \u2018You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your...\u2019 the ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, \u2018with your disreputable friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would have done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no. Too busy. Too modern. Too sceptical \u2013 till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally minded!\u2019 He shook his head \u2013 carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one, which was already becoming restive. \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know, young Zaphod,\u2019 he continued, \u2018I think I\u2019ll have to think about this one.\u2019 \u2018One minute ten,\u2019 said Ford hollowly. Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously. \u2018Why does that man keep talking in numbers?\u2019 he said. \u2018Those numbers,\u2019 said Zaphod tersely, \u2018are the time we\u2019ve got left to live.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. \u2018Doesn\u2019t apply to me, of course,\u2019 he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at. Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldn\u2019t just jump over and have done with it. \u2018Great grandfather,\u2019 he said, \u2018it applies to us! We are still alive, and we are about to lose our lives.\u2019 \u2018Good job too.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you\u2019ve made of it the phrase \u201cpig\u2019s ear\u201d comes irresistibly to mind.\u2019 \u2018But I was President of the Galaxy, man!\u2019 \u2018Huh,\u2019 muttered his ancestor, \u2018and what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!\u2019 \u2018Conceited little megapuppy.\u2019 Zaphod blinked in bewilderment. \u2018Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great grandfather.\u2019 The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn\u2019t feel a thing. \u2018You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod. You know because you\u2019ve been it, and I know because I\u2019m dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have a saying up here. \u201cLife is wasted on the living.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod bitterly, \u2018very good. Very deep. Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads.\u2019 \u2018Fifty seconds,\u2019 grunted Ford Prefect. \u2018Where was I?\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. \u2018Pontificating,\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox. \u2018Oh yes.\u2019 \u2018Can this guy,\u2019 muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, \u2018actually in fact help us?\u2019 \u2018Nobody else can,\u2019 whispered Zaphod. Ford nodded despondently. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 the ghost was saying. \u2018You became President of the Galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?\u2019 \u2018Could we go into this later?\u2019 \u2018Have you forgotten?\u2019 insisted the ghost. \u2018Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your brain when you get the job, you know. If they\u2019d found my head full of tricksy ideas I\u2019d have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 nodded the ghost in satisfaction, \u2018then you do remember!\u2019 He paused for a moment. \u2018Good,\u2019 he said and the noise stopped. \u2018Forty eight seconds,\u2019 said Ford. He looked again at his watch and tapped it. He looked up. \u2018Hey, the noise has stopped,\u2019 he said. A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost\u2019s hard little eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve slowed down time for a moment,\u2019 he said, \u2018just for a moment, you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say.\u2019 \u2018No, you listen to me, you see through old bat,\u2019 said Zaphod, leaping out of his chair. \u2018A \u2013 thanks for stopping time and all that, great, terrific, wonderful, but B \u2013 no thanks for the homily, right? I don\u2019t know what this great thing I\u2019m meant to be doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed not to know. And I resent that, right? \u2018The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain \u2013 my own brain \u2013 and locked off the bits that knew and cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. I wouldn\u2019t be able to go and be President, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to steal this ship, which must be the important thing. \u2018But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn\u2019t he, by changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices involve not knowing and not caring about this big number, whatever it is. That\u2019s what he wanted, that\u2019s what he got. \u2018Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well, I don\u2019t want to know, and I don\u2019t want to hear them. That\u2019s my choice. I\u2019m not going to be anybody\u2019s puppet, particularly not my own.\u2019 Zaphod banged on the console in fury, oblivious of the dumfounded looks he was attracting. \u2018The old me is dead!\u2019 he raved. \u2018Killed himself! The dead shouldn\u2019t hang about trying to interfere with the living!\u2019 \u2018And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape,\u2019 said the ghost. \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Zaphod, sitting down again, \u2018well that\u2019s different, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 He grinned at Trillian, weakly. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 rasped the apparition, \u2018I think the only reason I waste my breath on you is that being dead I don\u2019t have any other use for it.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018why don\u2019t you tell me what the big secret is. Try me.\u2019 \u2018Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher. Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something, with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must find \u2013 the man who controls this Galaxy, and \u2013 we suspect \u2013 others. Possibly the entire Universe.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 exclaimed an astonished ghost. \u2018Why? Look around you, lad, does it look to you as if it\u2019s in very good hands?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019 The old ghost glowered at him. \u2018I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this Improbability Drive ship, to where it is needed. You will do it. Don\u2019t think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field controls you, you are in its grip. What\u2019s this?\u2019 He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him. \u2018What\u2019s it doing?\u2019 \u2018It is trying,\u2019 said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, \u2018to make tea.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said his great grandfather, \u2018I approve of that. Now, Zaphod,\u2019 he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, \u2018I don\u2019t know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think you will not be able to avoid it. However, I am too long dead and too tired to care as much as I did. The principal reason I am helping you now is that I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of you and your modern friends slouching about up here. Understand?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, thanks a bundle.\u2019 \u2018Oh, and Zaphod?\u2019 \u2018Er, yeah?\u2019 \u2018If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you\u2019re in trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner...\u2019 \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018Please don\u2019t hesitate to get lost.\u2019 Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the wizened old ghost\u2019s hands to the computer, the ghost vanished, the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and space. 4 Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed across the sub etha from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw the final shreds of the Heart of Gold\u2019s force shield ripped away, and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke. Good, he thought. The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had ordered on the planet Earth, he thought. The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession) and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, he thought. There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the Meaning of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and truly sorted out, he thought. \u2018Family\u2019s always embarrassing, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Ford to Zaphod as the smoke began to clear. He paused, he looked about. \u2018Where\u2019s Zaphod?\u2019 he said. Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and shaken and didn\u2019t know where Zaphod was. \u2018Marvin?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Where\u2019s Zaphod?\u2019 \u2018Where\u2019s Marvin?\u2019 The robot\u2019s corner was empty. The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space. Occasionally it rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead, every vision screen was dead. They consulted the computer. It said: \u2018I regret I have been temporarily closed to all communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music.\u2019 They turned off the light music. They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any trace of Zaphod or of Marvin. One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the Nutri Matic machine was located. On the delivery plate of the Nutri Matic Drinks Synthesizer was a small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying \u2018Wait\u2019. 5 Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in the known Universe. Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more full of wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition of Playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words \u2018When you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life\u2019, the suicide rate there quadrupled overnight. Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta. It is a west zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close. No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials from the Galactic Geo Temporal Control Board to \u2018have a nice diurnal anomaly\u2019. There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on the ground there than elsewhere. If you approach Light City by air \u2013 and there is no other way of approaching it, no roads, no port facilities \u2013 if you don\u2019t fly they don\u2019t want to see you in Light City \u2013 you will see why it has this name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering on the swimming pools, shimmering on the white, palm lined boulevards, glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up and down them, gleaming off the villas, and hazy airpads, the beach bars and so on. Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall, beautiful building consisting of two thirty storey white towers connected by a bridge halfway up their length. The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the proceeds of an extraordinary copyright lawsuit fought between the book\u2019s editors and a breakfast cereal company. The book is a guide book, a travel book. It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful, books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor \u2013 more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and Fifty, better selling than The Big Bang Theory \u2013 A Personal View by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six) and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid\u2019s latest blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out. (And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, it has long supplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly it has the words DON\u2019T PANIC printed in large friendly letters on its cover.) It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty Altairian dollars a day \u2013 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left, astounded by the mind surfers floating carelessly along two feet above the waves as if this was nothing special, surprised and eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum tuneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in other words continuously. If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement caf\u00e9s where the UM Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon\u2019s relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those very few areas which doesn\u2019t enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon \u2013 it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday evening. Behind it lie the nightclubs. If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime \u2013 call it what you will \u2013 you had approached the second pavement caf\u00e9 on the right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM Betans chatting, drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually glancing at each other\u2019s watches to see how expensive they were. You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking hitchhikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few days. They were angry and bewildered to discover that here, within sight of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide building itself, a simple glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairian dollars. \u2018Sell out,\u2019 one of them said, bitterly. If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very startled and confused. The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold. \u2018Absolute sell out,\u2019 said the voice again. Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two dishevelled hitchhikers at the next table. Where the hell was he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the arm of the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still. \u2018How can they sit and write a guide for hitchhikers in a place like this?\u2019 continued the voice. \u2018I mean look at it. Look at it!\u2019 Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And why? He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the same pocket he felt a hard, smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it in surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with them on. They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you. Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but only a little bit. The angry hitchhiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice. \u2018Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa Minor Beta,\u2019 he grumbled, \u2018they\u2019ve all gone soft. You know, I\u2019ve even heard that they\u2019ve created a whole electronically synthesized Universe in one of their offices so they can go and research stories during the day and still go to parties in the evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place.\u2019 Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather\u2019s doing, but why? Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist them. They were the pre ordained promptings from the dark and locked off parts of his mind. He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him. He gave in to it. What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired, confused and hungry to resist. He didn\u2019t even know what the thought meant. 6 \u2018Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the whole of the known Universe, can I help you?\u2019 said the large pink winged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings and rolled its eyes. It glared at all the grubby people cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of keeping all the hitchhikers away. Weren\u2019t they meant to be hanging around dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance of hanging round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer immediately after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they ever did was complain. It shivered its wings. \u2018What?\u2019 it said into the phone. \u2018Yes, I passed on your message to Mr Zarniwoop, but I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s too cool to see you right now. He\u2019s on an intergalactic cruise.\u2019 It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to its left and not to interrupt an important phone call. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the insect, \u2018he is in his office, but he\u2019s on an intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling.\u2019 It slammed down the phone. \u2018Read the notice,\u2019 it said to the angry man who was trying to complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of misinformation contained in the book. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitively inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it\u2019s always reality that\u2019s got it wrong. This was the gist of the notice. It said, \u2018The Guide is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate.\u2019 This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal literally (it said \u2018Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists\u2019 instead of \u2018Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists\u2019) they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party in this case was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in a moving speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly confiscated it from all those there present before going off to enjoy a pleasant evening\u2019s ultragolf. Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect receptionist. \u2018OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018where\u2019s Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop.\u2019 \u2018Excuse me, sir?\u2019 said the insect icily. It did not care to be addressed in this manner. \u2018Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now.\u2019 \u2018Well, sir,\u2019 snapped the fragile little creature, \u2018if you could be a little cool about it...\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I\u2019m up to here with cool, OK? I am so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat in me for a month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before I blow it?\u2019 \u2018Well, if you\u2019d let me explain, sir,\u2019 said the insect, tapping the most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, \u2018I\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t possible right now as Mr Zarniwoop is on an intergalactic cruise.\u2019 Hell, thought Zaphod. \u2018When\u2019s he going to be back?\u2019 he said. \u2018Back, sir? He\u2019s in his office.\u2019 Zaphod paused whilst he tried to sort this particular thought out in his mind. He didn\u2019t succeed. \u2018This cat\u2019s on an intergalactic cruise... in his office?\u2019 He leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle. \u2018Listen, three eyes,\u2019 he said, \u2018don\u2019t you try to outweird me. I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal.\u2019 \u2018Well, just who do you think you are, honey,\u2019 flounced the insect quivering its wings in rage. \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?\u2019 \u2018Count the heads,\u2019 said Zaphod in a low rasp. The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again. \u2018You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?\u2019 it squeaked. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018but don\u2019t shout it out or they\u2019ll all want one.\u2019 \u2018The Zaphod Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn\u2019t you hear I come in six packs?\u2019 The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation. \u2018But sir,\u2019 it squealed, \u2018I just heard on the sub etha radio report. It said you were dead...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s right,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I just haven\u2019t stopped moving yet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?\u2019 \u2018Well sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but...\u2019 \u2018But he\u2019s on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to him?\u2019 \u2018The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporters are in the far corner sir. But, sir...\u2019 Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back. \u2018Yeah?\u2019 he said. \u2018Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself. \u2018I told myself I had to.\u2019 \u2018Come again, sir?\u2019 Zaphod leaned forward, conspiratorially. \u2018I just materialized out of thin air in one of your caf\u00e9s,\u2019 he said, \u2018as a result of an argument with the ghost of my great grandfather. No sooner had I got there than my former self, the one that operated on my brain, popped into my head and said, \u201cGo see Zarniwoop.\u201d I have never heard of the cat. That is all I know. That and the fact that I\u2019ve got to find the man who rules the Universe.\u2019 He winked. \u2018Mr Beeblebrox, sir,\u2019 said the insect in awed wonder, \u2018you\u2019re so weird you should be in movies.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, \u2018and you, baby, should be in real life.\u2019 The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone. A metal hand restrained it. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition collapse in tears. This was not such an insect, and it couldn\u2019t stand robots. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 it snapped, \u2018can I help you?\u2019 \u2018I doubt it,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Well in that case, if you\u2019ll just excuse me...\u2019 Six of the phones were now ringing. A million things awaited the insect\u2019s attention. \u2018No one can help me,\u2019 intoned Marvin. \u2018Yes, sir, well...\u2019 \u2018Not that anyone\u2019s tried, of course.\u2019 The restraining metal hand fell limply by Marvin\u2019s side. His head hung forward very slightly. \u2018Is that so?\u2019 the insect said tartly. \u2018Hardly worth anyone\u2019s while to help a menial robot, is it?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry, sir, if...\u2019 \u2018I mean where\u2019s the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesn\u2019t have any gratitude circuits?\u2019 \u2018And you don\u2019t have any?\u2019 said the insect, who didn\u2019t seem to be able to drag itself out of this conversation. \u2018I\u2019ve never had occasion to find out,\u2019 Marvin informed it. \u2018Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal...\u2019 \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to ask me what I want?\u2019 The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its eyes and darted back again. \u2018Is it worth it?\u2019 it asked. \u2018Is anything?\u2019 said Marvin immediately. \u2018What... do... you... want?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m looking for someone.\u2019 \u2018Who?\u2019 hissed the insect. \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018he\u2019s over there.\u2019 The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak. \u2018Then why did you ask me?\u2019 it screamed. \u2018I just wanted something to talk to,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018What!\u2019 \u2018Pathetic, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He caught up with Zaphod approaching the elevators. Zaphod spun round in astonishment. \u2018Hey... Marvin?\u2019 he said. \u2018Marvin! How did you get here?\u2019 Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he said. \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable. An Improbability Field, I expect.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I expect my great grandfather sent you along to keep me company. \u2018Thanks a bundle, Grandad,\u2019 he added to himself under his breath. \u2018So, how are you?\u2019 he said aloud. \u2018Oh, fine,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018if you happen to like being me which personally I don\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened. \u2018Hello,\u2019 said the elevator sweetly, \u2018I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices. If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic tax department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy and happy tales of the outside world.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, stepping into it, \u2018what else do you do besides talk?\u2019 \u2018I go up,\u2019 said the elevator, \u2018or down.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018We\u2019re going up.\u2019 \u2018Or down,\u2019 the elevator reminded him. \u2018Yeah, OK, up please.\u2019 There was a moment of silence. \u2018Down\u2019s very nice,\u2019 suggested the elevator hopefully. \u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 \u2018Super.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Now will you take us up?\u2019 \u2018May I ask you,\u2019 enquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, \u2018if you\u2019ve considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?\u2019 Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He didn\u2019t need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of. He hadn\u2019t asked to be here. If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he would probably have added something passionate on the subject of food. One thing he didn\u2019t want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if it wasn\u2019t him it would only be someone else. Most of all he didn\u2019t want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator. \u2018Like what other possibilities?\u2019 he said wearily. \u2018Well,\u2019 the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, \u2018there\u2019s the basement, the microfiles, the heating system... er...\u2019 It paused. \u2018Nothing particularly exciting,\u2019 it admitted, \u2018but they are alternatives.\u2019 \u2018Holy Zarquon,\u2019 muttered Zaphod, \u2018did I ask for an existential elevator?\u2019 He beat his fists against the wall. \u2018What\u2019s the matter with the thing?\u2019 he spat. \u2018It doesn\u2019t want to go up,\u2019 said Marvin simply. \u2018I think it\u2019s afraid.\u2019 \u2018Afraid?\u2019 cried Zaphod. \u2018Of what? Heights? An elevator that\u2019s afraid of heights?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the elevator miserably, \u2018of the future...\u2019 \u2018The future?\u2019 exclaimed Zaphod. \u2018What does the wretched thing want, a pension scheme?\u2019 At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them. From the walls around them came the sound of suddenly active machinery. \u2018We can all see into the future,\u2019 whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror, \u2018it\u2019s part of our programming.\u2019 Zaphod looked out of the elevator \u2013 an agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting. Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast. He ducked back in. \u2018Marvin,\u2019 he said, \u2018just get this elevator to go up, will you? We\u2019ve got to get to Zarniwoop.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said Marvin dolefully. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018but when I find him, he\u2019d better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him.\u2019 Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient electric winch and \u2018maximum capacity eight persons\u2019 jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital. This is because they operate on the curious principle of \u2018defocused temporal perception\u2019. In other words they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were previously forced to do whilst waiting for elevators. Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking. An impoverished hitchhiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators. At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors snapped open quickly. \u2018Fifteenth,\u2019 said the elevator, \u2018and remember, I\u2019m only doing this because I like your robot.\u2019 Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it. Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked. They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other. Through a large window the brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which danced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily. \u2018Left in the lurch by a lift,\u2019 muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty. They both stood and looked in both directions. \u2018You know something?\u2019 said Zaphod to Marvin. \u2018More than you can possibly imagine.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m dead certain this building shouldn\u2019t be shaking,\u2019 Zaphod said. It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet \u2013 and another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously. Another shadow flitted past. Zaphod looked at the floor. \u2018Either,\u2019 he said, not very confidently, \u2018they\u2019ve got some vibro system for toning up your muscles while you work, or...\u2019 He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz. Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window. \u2018Or,\u2019 he said, \u2018this building\u2019s being bombed!\u2019 Another roar cracked through the building. \u2018Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?\u2019 asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin\u2019s reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to stagger back to the elevator \u2013 a pointless maneouvre, he realized, but the only one he could think of. Suddenly, at the end of a corridor leading at right angles from this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a man. The man saw him. \u2018Beeblebrox, over here!\u2019 he shouted. Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building. \u2018No,\u2019 called Zaphod, \u2018Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?\u2019 \u2018A friend!\u2019 shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod. \u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Anyone\u2019s friend in particular, or just generally well disposed to people?\u2019 The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if they\u2019d been twice round the Galaxy and back with him in them. \u2018Do you know,\u2019 Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, \u2018your building\u2019s being bombed?\u2019 The man indicated his awareness. It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge, slug like, gun metal green spacecraft crept through the air past the building. Two more followed it. \u2018The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod,\u2019 hissed the man, \u2018they\u2019ve sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters.\u2019 \u2018Frogstar Fighters!\u2019 muttered Zaphod. \u2018Zarquon!\u2019 \u2018You get the picture?\u2019 \u2018What are Frogstar Fighters?\u2019 Zaphod was sure he\u2019d heard someone talk about them when he was President, but he never paid much attention to official matters. The man was pulling him back through a door. He went with him. With a searing whine a small black spider like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor. \u2018What was that?\u2019 hissed Zaphod. \u2018Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you,\u2019 said the man. \u2018Hey yeah?\u2019 \u2018Get down!\u2019 From the opposite direction came a larger black spider like object. It zapped past them. \u2018And that was...?\u2019 \u2018A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you.\u2019 \u2018And that?\u2019 said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air. \u2018A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you.\u2019 \u2018Hey,\u2019 chuckled Zaphod to himself, \u2018pretty stupid robots, eh?\u2019 From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and shape of a tank. \u2018Holy photon, what\u2019s that?\u2019 breathed Zaphod. \u2018A tank,\u2019 said the man, \u2018Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get you.\u2019 \u2018Should we leave?\u2019 \u2018I think we should.\u2019 \u2018Marvin!\u2019 called Zaphod. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them. \u2018You see that robot coming towards us?\u2019 Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body. He looked back up at the tank. \u2018I suppose you want me to stop it,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Whilst you save your skins.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018get in there!\u2019 \u2018Just so long,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018as I know where I stand.\u2019 The man tugged at Zaphod\u2019s arm, and Zaphod followed him off down the corridor. A point occurred to him about this. \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 he said. \u2018Zarniwoop\u2019s office.\u2019 \u2018Is this any time to keep an appointment?\u2019 \u2018Come on.\u2019 7 Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in fact a particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing. He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a probe. The probe withdrew. Marvin stood there. \u2018Out of my way, little robot,\u2019 growled the tank. \u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018that I\u2019ve been left here to stop you.\u2019 The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again. \u2018You? Stop me?\u2019 roared the tank. \u2018Go on!\u2019 \u2018No, really I have,\u2019 said Marvin simply. \u2018What are you armed with?\u2019 roared the tank in disbelief. \u2018Guess,\u2019 said Marvin. The tank\u2019s engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule sized electronic relays deep in its micro brain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation. \u2018Guess?\u2019 said the tank. Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second and along a third. The building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the building up, why was it taking so long? With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside. All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not lying on the beach having a wonderful time, and for what? A single chair, a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office. The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and single, revolutionary new form of paper clip, was empty. \u2018Where,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018is Zarniwoop?\u2019 feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip. \u2018He\u2019s on an intergalactic cruise,\u2019 said the man. Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices. \u2018Let me introduce myself,\u2019 the man said. \u2018My name is Roosta, and this is my towel.\u2019 \u2018Hello, Roosta,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Hello, towel,\u2019 he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by the corner. Outside the window, one of the huge, slug like, gun metal green spaceships growled past. \u2018Yes, go on,\u2019 said Marvin to the huge battle machine, \u2018you\u2019ll never guess.\u2019 \u2018Errrmmm...\u2019 said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed thought, \u2018laser beams?\u2019 Marvin shook his head solemnly. \u2018No,\u2019 muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble. \u2018Too obvious. Anti matter ray?\u2019 it hazarded. \u2018Far too obvious,\u2019 admonished Marvin. \u2018Yes,\u2019 grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed. \u2018Er... how about an electron ram?\u2019 This was new to Marvin. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 he said. \u2018One of these,\u2019 said the machine with enthusiasm. From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled. \u2018No,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018not one of those.\u2019 \u2018Good though, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Very good,\u2019 agreed Marvin. \u2018I know,\u2019 said the Frogstar battle machine, after another moment\u2019s consideration, \u2018you must have one of those new Xanthic Re Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!\u2019 \u2018Nice, aren\u2019t they?\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018That\u2019s what you\u2019ve got?\u2019 said the machine in considerable awe. \u2018No,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the machine, disappointed, \u2018then it must be...\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re thinking along the wrong lines,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018You\u2019re failing to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship between men and robots.\u2019 \u2018Er, I know,\u2019 said the battle machine, \u2018is it...\u2019 it tailed off into thought again. \u2018Just think,\u2019 urged Marvin, \u2018they left me, an ordinary, menial robot, to stop you, a gigantic heavy duty battle machine, whilst they ran off to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?\u2019 \u2018Oooh er,\u2019 muttered the machine in alarm, \u2018something pretty damn devastating, I should expect.\u2019 \u2018Expect!\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Oh yes, expect. I\u2019ll tell you what they gave me to protect myself with shall I?\u2019 \u2018Yes, all right,\u2019 said the battle machine, bracing itself. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Marvin. There was a dangerous pause. \u2018Nothing?\u2019 roared the battle machine. \u2018Nothing at all,\u2019 intoned Marvin dismally, \u2018not an electronic sausage.\u2019 The machine heaved about with fury. \u2018Well, doesn\u2019t that just take the biscuit!\u2019 it roared. \u2018Nothing, eh? Just don\u2019t think, do they?\u2019 \u2018And me,\u2019 said Marvin in a soft low voice, \u2018with this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side.\u2019 \u2018Makes you spit, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed Marvin with feeling. \u2018Hell that makes me angry,\u2019 bellowed the machine, \u2018think I\u2019ll smash that wall down!\u2019 The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and took out the wall next to the machine. \u2018How do you think I feel?\u2019 said Marvin bitterly. \u2018Just ran off and left you, did they?\u2019 the machine thundered. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018I think I\u2019ll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!\u2019 raged the tank. It took out the ceiling of the bridge. \u2018That\u2019s very impressive,\u2019 murmured Marvin. \u2018You ain\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u2019 promised the machine, \u2018I can take out this floor too, no trouble!\u2019 It took out the floor too. \u2018Hell\u2019s bells!\u2019 the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below. \u2018What a depressingly stupid machine,\u2019 said Marvin and trudged away. 8 \u2018So, do we just sit here, or what?\u2019 said Zaphod angrily. \u2018What do these guys out here want?\u2019 \u2018You, Beeblebrox,\u2019 said Roosta. \u2018They\u2019re going to take you to the Frogstar \u2013 the most totally evil world in the Galaxy.\u2019 \u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018They\u2019ll have to come and get me first.\u2019 \u2018They have come and got you,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018look out of the window.\u2019 Zaphod looked, and gaped. \u2018The ground\u2019s going away!\u2019 he gasped. \u2018Where are they taking the ground?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re taking the building,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018we\u2019re airborne.\u2019 Clouds streaked past the office window. Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower in a firm grip. Zaphod shook his head in perplexity. \u2018What have I done to deserve this?\u2019 he said. \u2018I walk into a building, they take it away.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s not what you\u2019ve done they\u2019re worried about,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018it\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do.\u2019 \u2018Well, don\u2019t I get a say in that?\u2019 \u2018You did, years ago. You\u2019d better hold on, we\u2019re in for a fast and bumpy journey.\u2019 \u2018If I ever meet myself,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I\u2019ll hit myself so hard I won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit me.\u2019 Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off. On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian\u2019s eyes as she looked at him enquiringly. He looked back at the rack. Finally he saw it. He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack. The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I. He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E. \u2018Exquisite,\u2019 he said, \u2018on a triple word score. Scores rather a lot, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the nth time. Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again. Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect\u2019s feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead instruments. Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought. Why did it rock and sway? Why could he not find out where they were? Where, basically, were they? The left hand tower of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the Universe. In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily. Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance. \u2018Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?\u2019 demanded Zaphod. \u2018The Frogstar,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018the most totally evil place in the Universe.\u2019 \u2018Do they have food there?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Food? You\u2019re going to the Frogstar and you\u2019re worried about whether they got food?\u2019 \u2018Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar.\u2019 Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal. \u2018Here, suck this,\u2019 said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel. Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring. \u2018It\u2019s soaked in nutrients,\u2019 explained Roosta. \u2018What are you, a messy eater or something?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extract.\u2019 Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement. \u2018What are the brown stains?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Bar B Q sauce,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018for when I get sick of wheatgerm.\u2019 Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully. Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again. \u2018Ugh,\u2019 he stated. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018when I\u2019ve had to suck that end I usually need to suck the other end a bit too.\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 asked Zaphod suspiciously, \u2018what\u2019s in that?\u2019 \u2018Anti depressants,\u2019 said Roosta. \u2018I\u2019ve gone right off this towel, you know,\u2019 said Zaphod handing it back. Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up. \u2018Beeblebrox,\u2019 he said, sticking his hands behind his head, \u2018have you any idea what\u2019s going to happen to you on the Frogstar?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re going to feed me?\u2019 hazarded Zaphod hopefully. \u2018They\u2019re going to feed you,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018into the Total Perspective Vortex!\u2019 Zaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard of all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked Roosta what it was. \u2018Only,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018the most savage psychic torture a sentient being can undergo.\u2019 Zaphod nodded a resigned nod. \u2018So,\u2019 he said, \u2018no food, huh?\u2019 \u2018Listen!\u2019 said Roosta urgently. \u2018You can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man\u2019s soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effects last the rest of your life!\u2019 \u2018You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?\u2019 asked Zaphod sharply. \u2018This is worse.\u2019 \u2018Phreeow!\u2019 admitted Zaphod, much impressed. \u2018Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?\u2019 he added a moment later. \u2018They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever. They know what you\u2019re after.\u2019 \u2018Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?\u2019 \u2018You know,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018you know, Beeblebrox. You want to meet the man who rules the Universe.\u2019 \u2018Can he cook?\u2019 said Zaphod. On reflection he added: \u2018I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn\u2019t worry about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook.\u2019 Roosta sighed heavily. \u2018What are you doing here, anyway?\u2019 demanded Zaphod. \u2018What\u2019s all this got to do with you?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m just one of those who planned this thing, along with Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox.\u2019 \u2018Me?\u2019 \u2018Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn\u2019t realize how much.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you.\u2019 \u2018What job, man, what are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018I will do it before I leave you.\u2019 Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence. Zaphod was terribly glad. 9 The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome. The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across its surface. The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had long been deserted. The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world. At the top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here. The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities. This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend. About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash landed buildings. Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that was waiting for something. The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks. The larger speck was the left hand tower of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World B. As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men. He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said: \u2018Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do.\u2019 Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin. \u2018Yeah?\u2019 he said. \u2018The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the building, do not go out of the door,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018go out of the window. \u2018Good luck,\u2019 he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing from Zaphod\u2019s life as mysteriously as he had entered it. Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already locked it. He shrugged and returned to the corner. Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex. Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced. He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved. Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with. He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some miracle, was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin\u2019s help he got the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside. Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop\u2019s office was on the fifteenth floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty five degrees, but still the descent looked heart stopping. Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building. Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground. As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin. The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of, \u2018This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for information,\u2019 did little to improve his state of mind. About halfway down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual. Eventually he realized this wasn\u2019t so. The robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood. A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod. It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch. Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat, the beak underdeveloped, and halfway along the underside of its wings the vestige of something handlike could be clearly seen. In fact, it looked almost human. It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion. \u2018Go away,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018OK,\u2019 muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust again. Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment. \u2018Did that bird just talk to me?\u2019 he asked Marvin nervously. He was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinating. \u2018Yes,\u2019 confirmed Marvin. \u2018Poor souls,\u2019 said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod\u2019s ear. Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on, breathing heavily. The voice had no visible source whatsoever \u2013 there was no one there. Nevertheless, it spoke again. \u2018A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight.\u2019 Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly when you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building. \u2018Hey, er...\u2019 he stammered. \u2018Shall I tell you their story?\u2019 enquired the voice quietly. \u2018Hey, who are you?\u2019 panted Zaphod. \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Later then, perhaps,\u2019 murmured the voice. \u2018I am Gargravarr. I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.\u2019 \u2018Why can\u2019t I see...\u2019 \u2018You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated,\u2019 the voice lifted, \u2018if you move about two yards to your left. Why don\u2019t you try it?\u2019 Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he shifted himself across to them. \u2018Why don\u2019t I see you again at the bottom?\u2019 said the voice in his ear, and as it spoke it faded. \u2018Hey,\u2019 called out Zaphod. \u2018Where are you...\u2019 \u2018It\u2019ll only take you a couple of minutes...\u2019 said the voice very faintly. \u2018Marvin,\u2019 said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him, \u2018did a... did a voice just...\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 Marvin replied tersely. Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again. They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He would find his way down the building more comfortably if he didn\u2019t actually have to look at what he was doing. Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building and, once more removing his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground. Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and rubble, from which position he seemed disinclined to move. \u2018Ah, there you are,\u2019 said the voice suddenly in Zaphod\u2019s ear. \u2018Excuse me leaving you like that, it\u2019s just that I have a terrible head for heights. At least,\u2019 it added wistfully, \u2018I did have a terrible head for heights.\u2019 Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings. \u2018Hey, er, why can\u2019t I see you?\u2019 he said. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you here?\u2019 \u2018I am here,\u2019 said the voice slowly. \u2018My body wanted to come but it\u2019s a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see.\u2019 After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, \u2018You know how it is with bodies.\u2019 Zaphod wasn\u2019t sure about this. \u2018I thought I did,\u2019 he said. \u2018I only hope it\u2019s gone in for a rest cure,\u2019 continued the voice, \u2018the way it\u2019s been living recently it must be on its last elbows.\u2019 \u2018Elbows?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Don\u2019t you mean last legs?\u2019 The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around uneasily. He didn\u2019t know if it had gone or was still there or what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again. \u2018So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?\u2019 \u2018Er, well,\u2019 said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, \u2018this cat\u2019s in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and take in a look at the local scenery, you know?\u2019 \u2018Have you seen the local scenery?\u2019 asked the voice of Gargravarr. \u2018Er, no.\u2019 Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view. He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B. \u2018Ah, OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ll just sort of slouch about, then.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018the Vortex is ready for you now. You must come. Follow me.\u2019 \u2018Er, yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018And how am I meant to do that?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll hum for you,\u2019 said Gargravarr. \u2018Follow the humming.\u2019 A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that seemed to be without any kind of focus. It was only by listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake. What else was there to do? 10 The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore. Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do. For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire \u2018intelligent\u2019 population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death and the importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches. In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts. Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it is. For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says \u2018You are here.\u2019 The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain. The wind whipped wildly over it. Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This, gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total Perspective Vortex. As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body. It screamed above the wind and died away. Zaphod stared with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium. \u2018Hey, what was that?\u2019 he muttered voicelessly. \u2018A recording,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018of the last man who was put in the Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of prelude.\u2019 \u2018Hey, it really sounds bad...\u2019 stammered Zaphod, \u2018couldn\u2019t we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?\u2019 \u2018For all I know,\u2019 said Gargravarr\u2019s ethereal voice, \u2018I\u2019m probably at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me. Says I only get in the way. Hey ho.\u2019 \u2018What is all this with your body?\u2019 said Zaphod, anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him. \u2018Well, it\u2019s... it\u2019s busy, you know,\u2019 said Gargravarr hesitantly. \u2018You mean it\u2019s got a mind of its own?\u2019 said Zaphod. There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke again. \u2018I have to say,\u2019 he replied eventually, \u2018that I find that remark in rather poor taste.\u2019 Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology. \u2018No matter,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018you weren\u2019t to know.\u2019 The voice fluttered unhappily. \u2018The truth is,\u2019 it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control, \u2018the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I suspect it will end in divorce.\u2019 The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to say. He mumbled uncertainly. \u2018I think we were probably not very well suited,\u2019 said Gargravarr again at length, \u2018we never seemed to be happy doing the same things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my body refuses to let me in. It won\u2019t even see me...\u2019 He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain. \u2018It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was meant to inhabit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right up a body\u2019s left nostril, and so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename.\u2019 \u2018Oh...?\u2019 said Zaphod faintly. \u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Pizpot,\u2019 said the voice. \u2018My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it all really, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Errr...\u2019 said Zaphod sympathetically. \u2018And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job, Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk on the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex \u2013 they don\u2019t really count, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 \u2018Ah...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?\u2019 \u2018Er...\u2019 \u2018Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet \u2013 people, cities, shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing. It\u2019s a well known economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon, and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops. Result \u2013 collapse, ruin and famine. Most of the population died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds \u2013 you\u2019ve seen one of them \u2013 who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you to the Vortex.\u2019 Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain. \u2018And you,\u2019 he said, \u2018you come from this hellhole pit, do you?\u2019 \u2018No no,\u2019 said Gargravarr, taken aback, \u2018I come from the Frogstar World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in the evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total Perspective Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function. It was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep.\u2019 At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered. \u2018What can do that to a guy?\u2019 he breathed. \u2018The Universe,\u2019 said Gargravarr simply, \u2018the whole infinite Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small.\u2019 \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know,\u2019 muttered Zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his ego. Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain. As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small darkened chamber within. \u2018Enter,\u2019 said Gargravarr. Zaphod started with fear. \u2018Hey, what, now?\u2019 he said. \u2018Now.\u2019 Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It was steel lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man. \u2018It... er... it doesn\u2019t look like any kind of Vortex to me,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018It isn\u2019t,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018it\u2019s just the elevator.Enter.\u2019 With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking. The elevator began its descent. \u2018I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this,\u2019 muttered Zaphod. \u2018There is no right frame of mind,\u2019 said Gargravarr sternly. \u2018You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t. The Vortex does.\u2019 At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel lined chamber. At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large enough for a man to stand in. It was that simple. It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire. \u2018Is that it?\u2019 said Zaphod in surprise. \u2018That is it.\u2019 Didn\u2019t look too bad, thought Zaphod. \u2018And I get in there, do I?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018You get in there,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018and I\u2019m afraid you must do it now.\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod. He opened the door of the box and stepped in. Inside the box he waited. After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him. 11 The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. To explain \u2013 since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation \u2013 every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake. The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife. Trin Tragula \u2013 for that was his name \u2013 was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot. And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake. \u2018Have some sense of proportion!\u2019 she would say, sometimes as often as thirty eight times in a single day. And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex \u2013 just to show her. And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it. To Trin Tragula\u2019s horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion. The door of the Vortex swung open. From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones. He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did. Instead, he stepped out. \u2018Hi!\u2019 he said. \u2018Beeblebrox...\u2019 gasped Gargravarr\u2019s mind in amazement. \u2018Could I have a drink, please?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018You... you... have been in the Vortex?\u2019 stammered Gargravarr. \u2018You saw me, kid.\u2019 \u2018And it was working?\u2019 \u2018Sure was.\u2019 \u2018And you saw the whole infinity of creation?\u2019 \u2018Sure. Really neat place, you know that?\u2019 Gargravarr\u2019s mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open. \u2018And you saw yourself,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018in relation to it all?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yeah yeah.\u2019 \u2018But... what did you experience?\u2019 Zaphod shrugged smugly. \u2018It just told me what I knew all the time. I\u2019m a really terrific and great guy. Didn\u2019t I tell you, baby, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox!\u2019 His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped, startled. He breathed heavily. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, \u2018is that really a piece of fairy cake?\u2019 He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded. \u2018If I told you how much I needed this,\u2019 he said ravenously, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have time to eat it.\u2019 He ate it. 12 A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city. The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous. The elation of his recent experience was still with him though. The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him \u2013 everything. And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told by a machine is another. He didn\u2019t have time to reflect on this matter. Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide. What he was going to do he didn\u2019t know, but feeling that he was the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up. Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism. He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city. He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on. After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him with... well, with anything. He approached the building. Along one side of it \u2013 the front it would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area \u2013 were three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these was open, and towards this Zaphod ran. Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches deep over the floor. Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris. The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons. They were all spacecraft, all derelict. Zaphod wandered in frustration amongst the hulks. There was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself. Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old feedline. He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship. To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming slightly. He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the feedline in his hands. He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight humming vibration was more distinct. His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ship\u2019s side. He could hear only a faint, indeterminate noise. He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship. What he heard made his brains turn somersaults. The voice said: \u2018Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon soaked paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again.\u2019 Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship. He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging, but by only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was covered with grime, but some of the figures were still discernible. Zaphod\u2019s eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief calculations. His eyes widened. \u2018Nine hundred years...\u2019 he breathed to himself. That was how late the ship was. Two minutes later he was on board. As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was cool and fresh \u2013 the air conditioning was still working. The lights were still on. He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it. Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him. \u2018Please return to your seat, sir,\u2019 said the android stewardess and, turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of him. When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through. He followed her through the door. They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod\u2019s heart stopped still again for a moment. In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat. The passengers\u2019 hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were long, the men wore beards. All of them were quite clearly alive \u2013 but sleeping. Zaphod had the creeping horrors. He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was halfway down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other end. She turned and spoke. \u2018Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 she said sweetly, \u2018thank you for bearing with us during this slight delay. We will be taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits.\u2019 There was a slight hum. At that moment, all the passengers awoke. They awoke screaming and clawing at the straps and life support systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter. They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them. Then one of them rose from his seat. He turned and looked at Zaphod. Zaphod\u2019s skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam. He plunged through the door and back into the corridor. The man pursued him. He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck, slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the door breathing hard. Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door. From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him. \u2018Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return to your seat.\u2019 Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand continued to knock on the door. \u2018Please return to your seat,\u2019 repeated the autopilot. \u2018Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not a passenger,\u2019 panted Zaphod. \u2018Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018I am not a passenger!\u2019 shouted Zaphod again. \u2018Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018I am not a... hello, can you hear me?\u2019 \u2018Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re the autopilot?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the voice from the flight console. \u2018You\u2019re in charge of this ship?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the voice again, \u2018there has been a delay. Passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their comfort and convenience. Coffee and biscuits are served every year, after which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience. Departure will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize for the delay.\u2019 Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now ceased. He approached the flight console. \u2018Delay?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Have you seen the world outside this ship? It\u2019s a wasteland, a desert. Civilization\u2019s been and gone, man. There are no lemon soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere!\u2019 \u2018The statistical likelihood,\u2019 continued the autopilot primly, \u2018is that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be lemon soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short delay. Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod spun round to see the man who had pursued him standing there. He carried a large briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had no beard and no long fingernails. \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox,\u2019 he said, \u2018my name is Zarniwoop. I believe you wanted to see me.\u2019 Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He dropped into a chair. \u2018Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?\u2019 he said. \u2018I have been waiting here for you,\u2019 he said in a businesslike tone. He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair. \u2018I am glad you followed instructions,\u2019 he said. \u2018I was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather than the window. Then you would have been in trouble.\u2019 Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled. \u2018When you entered the door of my office, you entered my electronically synthesized Universe,\u2019 he explained, \u2018if you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one. The artificial one works from here.\u2019 He patted the briefcase smugly. Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing. \u2018What\u2019s the difference?\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018they are identical. Oh \u2013 except that I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 spat Zaphod. \u2018Simple,\u2019 said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made Zaphod seethe. \u2018Very simple,\u2019 repeated Zarniwoop. \u2018I discovered the co ordinates at which this man could be found \u2013 the man who rules the Universe and discovered that his world was protected by an Unprobability Field. To protect my secret \u2013 and myself \u2013 I retreated to the safety of this totally artificial Universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner. I was secure. Meanwhile, you and I...\u2019 \u2018You and I?\u2019 said Zaphod angrily. \u2018You mean I knew you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018we knew each other well.\u2019 \u2018I had no taste,\u2019 said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence. \u2018Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the Improbability Drive ship \u2013 the only one which could reach the ruler\u2019s world \u2013 and bring it to me here. This you have now done I trust, and I congratulate you.\u2019 He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick. \u2018Oh, and in case you were wondering,\u2019 added Zarniwoop, \u2018this Universe was created specifically for you to come to. You are therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would never,\u2019 he said with an even more brickable smile, \u2018have survived the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?\u2019 \u2018Where?\u2019 said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed. \u2018To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it, I trust?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Where is your jacket?\u2019 Zaphod looked at him in mystification. \u2018My jacket? I took it off. It\u2019s outside.\u2019 \u2018Good, we will go and find it.\u2019 Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him. Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits. \u2018It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you,\u2019 said Zarniwoop. \u2018Not pleasant for you!\u2019 bawled Zaphod. \u2018How do you think...\u2019 Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open. A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod\u2019s jacket lying in the debris. \u2018A very remarkable and very powerful ship,\u2019 said Zarniwoop. \u2018Watch.\u2019 As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It split, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing. It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its full size. \u2018At an Improbability Level,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018of... oh I don\u2019t know, but something very large.\u2019 Zaphod swayed. \u2018You mean I had it with me all the time?\u2019 Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it. He twisted a single switch inside it. \u2018Goodbye artificial Universe,\u2019 he said, \u2018hello real one!\u2019 The scene before them shimmered briefly \u2013 and reappeared exactly as before. \u2018You see?\u2019 said Zarniwoop. \u2018Exactly the same.\u2019 \u2018You mean,\u2019 repeated Zaphod tautly, \u2018that I had it with me all the time?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018of course. That was the whole point.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018You can count me out, from here on in you can count me out. I\u2019ve had all I want of this. You play your own games.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid you cannot leave,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018you are entwined in the Improbability Field. You cannot escape.\u2019 He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time Zaphod hit it. 13 Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold. \u2018Trillian! Arthur!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018It\u2019s working! The ship\u2019s reactivated!\u2019 Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor. \u2018Come on, you guys, we\u2019re going, we\u2019re off,\u2019 he said, kicking them awake. \u2018Hi there, guys!\u2019 twittered the computer. \u2018It\u2019s really great to be back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that\u2014\u2019 \u2018Shut up,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018and tell us where the hell we are.\u2019 \u2018Frogstar World B, and man it\u2019s a dump,\u2019 said Zaphod, running on to the bridge. \u2018Hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me you can\u2019t even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am.\u2019 \u2018What a what?\u2019 said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the floor and not taking any of this in. \u2018I know how you feel,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I\u2019m so great even I get tongue tied talking to myself. Hey, it\u2019s good to see you, Trillian, Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer...?\u2019 \u2018Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox, sir, sure is a great honour to\u2014\u2019 \u2018Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast.\u2019 \u2018Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?\u2019 \u2018Anywhere, doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 shouted Zaphod. \u2018Yes it does!\u2019 he said again. \u2018We want to go to the nearest place to eat!\u2019 \u2018Sure thing,\u2019 said the computer happily and a massive explosion rocked the bridge. When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest. 14 Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever. After what seemed an eternity the seas receded and left them lying on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of Life, the Universe and Everything. Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them. The cold hard shore tipped and spun and then stood still. It shone darkly \u2013 it was a very highly polished cold hard shore. A green blur watched them disapprovingly. It coughed. \u2018Good evening, madam, gentlemen,\u2019 it said, \u2018do you have a reservation?\u2019 Ford Prefect\u2019s consciousness snapped back like elastic, making his brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur. \u2018Reservation?\u2019 he said weakly. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 said the green blur. \u2018Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?\u2019 In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did. \u2018Afterlife, sir?\u2019 it said. Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath. \u2018Is this the afterlife?\u2019 he stammered. \u2018Well, I assume so,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, trying to work out which way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and staggered to what he hoped were his feet. \u2018I mean,\u2019 he said, swaying gently, \u2018there\u2019s no way we could have survived that blast, is there?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but it didn\u2019t seem to improve things. He slumped down again. \u2018No,\u2019 said Trillian, standing up, \u2018no way at all.\u2019 A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod Beeblebrox attempting to speak. \u2018I certainly didn\u2019t survive,\u2019 he gurgled, \u2018I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, thanks to you,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we didn\u2019t stand a chance. We must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, struggling noisily to his feet. \u2018If the lady and gentlemen would care to order drinks...\u2019 said the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them. \u2018Kerpow, splat,\u2019 continued Zaphod, \u2018instantaneously zonked into our component molecules. Hey, Ford,\u2019 he said, identifying one of the slowly solidifying blurs around him, \u2018did you get that thing of your whole life flashing before you?\u2019 \u2018You got that too?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Your whole life?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018at least I assume it was mine. I spend a lot of time out of my skulls, you know.\u2019 He looked around him at the various shapes that were at last becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless shapes. \u2018So...\u2019 he said. \u2018So what?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018So here we are,\u2019 said Zaphod hesitantly, \u2018lying dead...\u2019 \u2018Standing,\u2019 Trillian corrected him. \u2018Er, standing dead,\u2019 continued Zaphod, \u2018in this desolate...\u2019 \u2018Restaurant,\u2019 said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing that surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could see. \u2018Here we are,\u2019 continued Zaphod doggedly, \u2018standing dead in this desolate...\u2019 \u2018Five star,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Restaurant,\u2019 concluded Zaphod. \u2018Odd, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Er, yeah.\u2019 \u2018Nice chandeliers though,\u2019 said Trillian. They looked about themselves in bemusement. \u2018It\u2019s not so much an afterlife,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018more a sort of apr\u00e8s vie.\u2019 The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the low vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal Universe, have been painted in that particular shade of deep turquoise, and even if it had been it wouldn\u2019t have been highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not, however, an ideal Universe, as was further evidenced by the eye crossing patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the way in which the fronting for the eighty yard long marble topped bar had been made. The fronting for the eighty yard long marble topped bar had been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in. A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar or relaxing in the richly coloured body hugging seats that were deployed here and there about the bar area. A young Vl\u2019Hurg officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the dazzling light of the main body of the restaurant beyond. Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside the corner of the curtain and looked out at a bleak and drear landscape, grey, pockmarked and dismal, a landscape which under normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping horrors. These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his back and off the top off his head was the sky. The sky was... An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place. \u2018All in good time, sir,\u2019 he said. Zaphod\u2019s eyes flashed. \u2018Hey, hang about, you dead guys,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think we\u2019re missing some ultra important thing here you know. Something somebody said and we missed it.\u2019 Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he had just seen. He said, \u2018I said it was a sort of apr\u00e8s...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, and don\u2019t you wish you hadn\u2019t?\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018Ford?\u2019 \u2018I said it was odd.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was\u2014\u2019 \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 interrupted the green blur who had by this time resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark suited green waiter, \u2018perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks...\u2019 \u2018Drinks!\u2019 cried Zaphod. \u2018That was it! See what you miss if you don\u2019t stay alert.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir,\u2019 said the waiter patiently. \u2018If the lady and gentlemen would care to take drinks before dinner...\u2019 \u2018Dinner!\u2019 Zaphod exclaimed with passion. \u2018Listen, little green person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night for the mere idea.\u2019 \u2018... and the Universe,\u2019 continued the waiter, determined not to be deflected on his home stretch, \u2018will explode later for your pleasure.\u2019 Ford\u2019s head swivelled slowly towards him. He spoke with feeling. \u2018Wow,\u2019 he said. \u2018What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?\u2019 The waiter laughed a polite little waiter\u2019s laugh. \u2018Ah,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I hope not,\u2019 breathed Ford. The waiter coughed a polite little waiter\u2019s cough. \u2018It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disorientated by the time journey,\u2019 he said, \u2018so if I might suggest...\u2019 \u2018Time journey?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Time journey?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Time journey?\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018You mean this isn\u2019t the afterlife?\u2019 said Arthur. The waiter smiled a polite little waiter\u2019s smile. He had almost exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic little waiter. \u2018Afterlife, sir?\u2019 he said. \u2018No, sir.\u2019 \u2018And we\u2019re not dead?\u2019 said Arthur. The waiter tightened his lips. \u2018Aha, ha,\u2019 he said. \u2018Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I would not attempt to serve sir.\u2019 In an extraordinary gesture which it is pointless attempting to describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two of his arms and one of his thighs with the other. \u2018Hey, guys,\u2019 he said, \u2018this is crazy. We did it. We finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!\u2019 \u2018Milliways!\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel, \u2018this is Milliways \u2013 the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\u2019 \u2018End of what?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018In just a few minutes, sir,\u2019 said the waiter. He took a deep breath. He didn\u2019t need to do this since his body was supplied with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take a deep breath. \u2018Now, if you would care to order your drinks at last,\u2019 he said, \u2018I will then show you to your table.\u2019 Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and bought most of it. 15 The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has been built on the fragmented remains of... it will be built on the fragmented... that is to say it will have been built by this time, and indeed has been\u2014 One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well adjusted family can\u2019t cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history \u2013 the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner\u2019s Time Traveller\u2019s Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you for instance how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is further complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst you are actually travelling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father. Most readers get as far as the Future Semi Conditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up: and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term \u2018Future Perfect\u2019 has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. To resume: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. This is, many would say, impossible. In it, guests take (willan on take) their places at table and eat (willan on eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen) the whole of creation explode around them. This, many would say, is equally impossible. You can arrive (mayan arrivan on when) for any sitting you like without prior (late fore when) reservation because you can book retrospectively, as it were, when you return to your own time. (You can have on book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta retrohome.) This is, many would not insist, absolutely impossible. At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con with dinan on when) a fascinating cross section of the entire population of space and time. This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on visit re onvisiting... and so on \u2013 for further tense correction consult Dr Streetmentioner\u2019s book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, because of the embarrassment this usually causes. This, even if the rest were true, which it isn\u2019t, is patently impossible, say the doubters. All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for. This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which is why the advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon came up with this slogan: \u2018If you\u2019ve done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?\u2019 16 At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch. He was miserably happy. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018whilst you\u2019re still capable of speech, would you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have you been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I\u2019d like it cleared up.\u2019 Zaphod\u2019s left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further into the obscurity of drink. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve been around. They want me to find the man who rules the Universe, but I don\u2019t care to meet him. I believe the man can\u2019t cook.\u2019 His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded. \u2018True,\u2019 it said, \u2018have another drink.\u2019 Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging \u2013 expensive and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford decided, he didn\u2019t really care too much. \u2018Listen, Ford,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018everything\u2019s cool and froody.\u2019 \u2018You mean everything\u2019s under control.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I do not mean everything\u2019s under control. That would not be cool and froody. If you want to know what happened let\u2019s just say I had the whole situation in my pocket. OK?\u2019 Ford shrugged. Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top. A wild skinned sky gypsy approached them and played electric violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed to go away again. The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part of the bar. \u2018I don\u2019t know what this place is,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018but I think it gives me the creeps.\u2019 \u2018Have another drink,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Enjoy yourself.\u2019 \u2018Which?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The two are mutually exclusive.\u2019 \u2018Poor Arthur, you\u2019re not really cut out for this life, are you?\u2019 \u2018You call this life?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re beginning to sound like Marvin.\u2019 \u2018Marvin\u2019s the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make this violinist go away?\u2019 The waiter approached. \u2018Your table is ready,\u2019 he said. Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten rock. Each of its arms house the bars, the kitchens, the force field generators which protect the entire structure and the decayed hunk of planet on which it sits, and the Time Turbines which slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the crucial moment. In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and Trillian now passed. At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them, and covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not available because they were already encrusted with jewels, precious sea shells from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles, lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and decorations. Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur Dent goggled. \u2018Wowee,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Zappo.\u2019 \u2018Incredible!\u2019 breathed Arthur. \u2018The people... ! The things... !\u2019 \u2018The things,\u2019 said Ford Prefect quietly, \u2018are also people.\u2019 \u2018The people...\u2019 resumed Arthur, \u2018the... other people...\u2019 \u2018The lights... !\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018The tables... !\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The clothes... !\u2019 said Trillian. The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs. \u2018The End of the Universe is very popular,\u2019 said Zaphod, threading his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of marble, some of rich ultra mahogany, some even of platinum, and at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves and studying menus. \u2018People like to dress up for it,\u2019 continued Zaphod. \u2018Gives it a sense of occasion.\u2019 The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central stage area where a small band was playing light music, at least a thousand tables was Arthur\u2019s guess, and interspersed amongst them were swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary, in short all the paraphernalia common to the restaurants where little expense had been spared to give the impression that no expense has been spared. Arthur glanced round, half expecting to see someone making an American Express commercial. Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod. \u2018Wowee,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Zappo,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer\u2019s works, you know,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I told it to take us to the nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe. Remind me to be nice to it one day.\u2019 He paused. \u2018Hey, everybody\u2019s here, you know. Everybody who was anybody.\u2019 \u2018Was?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a lot,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018\u2019cos everything\u2019s been done, you know. Hi, guys,\u2019 he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana life forms, \u2018how did you do?\u2019 \u2018Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?\u2019 asked one iguana of another iguana. \u2018I think so,\u2019 replied the second iguana. \u2018Well, doesn\u2019t that just take the biscuit,\u2019 said the first iguana. \u2018Funny old thing, life,\u2019 said the second iguana. \u2018It\u2019s what you make it,\u2019 said the first and they lapsed back into silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the Universe. \u2018Hey, Zaphod,\u2019 said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, missing. He pointed a swaying finger. \u2018There\u2019s an old mate of mine,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hotblack Desiato! See the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?\u2019 Zaphod tried to follow Ford\u2019s finger with his eyes but it made him feel dizzy. Finally he saw. \u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 he said, then recognition came a moment later. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, \u2018did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the biggest thing ever. Other than me.\u2019 \u2018Who\u2019s he supposed to be?\u2019 asked Trillian. \u2018Hotblack Desiato?\u2019 said Zaphod in astonishment. \u2018You don\u2019t know? You never heard of Disaster Area?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Trillian, who hadn\u2019t. \u2018The biggest,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018loudest...\u2019 \u2018Richest...\u2019 suggested Zaphod. \u2018... rock band in the history of...\u2019 He searched for the word. \u2018... history itself,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018No,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Zowee,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018here we are at the End of the Universe and you haven\u2019t even lived yet. Did you miss out.\u2019 He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone. Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance. \u2018Hey, er, Hotblack,\u2019 he called out, \u2018how you doing? Great to see you, big boy, how\u2019s the noise? You\u2019re looking great, really very, very fat and unwell. Amazing.\u2019 He slapped the man on the back and was mildly surprised that it seemed to elicit no response. The Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters swilling round inside him told him to plunge on regardless. \u2018Remember the old days?\u2019 he said. \u2018We used to hang out, right? The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim\u2019s Throat Emporium? The Evildrome Boozarama, great days, eh?\u2019 Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great days or not. Ford was not perturbed. \u2018And when we were hungry we\u2019d pose as public health inspectors, you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks, right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above the Caf\u00e9 Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all hated them. And you said you didn\u2019t care, and we said we did because we hated them so much.\u2019 Ford\u2019s eyes were beginning to mist over. \u2018And you said you didn\u2019t want to be a star,\u2019 he continued, wallowing in nostalgia, \u2018because you despised the star system. And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn\u2019t think you had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!\u2019 He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables. \u2018Here,\u2019 he said \u2018is a man who buys star systems!\u2019 Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly. \u2018I think someone\u2019s drunk,\u2019 muttered a purple bush like being into his wine glass. Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing Hotblack Desiato. \u2018What\u2019s that number you do?\u2019 he said, unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over \u2013 into a nearby glass as it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass. \u2018That really huge number,\u2019 he continued, \u2018how does it go? \u201cBwarm! Bwarm! Baderr!!\u201d something, and in the stage act you do it ends up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually do it!\u2019 Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat graphically. He knocked the bottle over again. \u2018Ship! Sun! Wham bang!\u2019 he cried. \u2018I mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible songs.\u2019 His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought. \u2018Hey, you want a drink?\u2019 he said. It began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said \u2018Hi, Ford,\u2019 or \u2018Great to see you after all this time,\u2019 or in fact anything at all. More to the point he had not yet even moved. \u2018Hotblack?\u2019 said Ford. A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into which the man\u2019s body had been stuffed looked as if its only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit. The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended. \u2018Kid...\u2019 said a voice which emerged from the man\u2019s mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest. \u2018Er, yeah?\u2019 said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn\u2019t come further up the man\u2019s body. \u2018Beat it,\u2019 said the man. \u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, \u2018and who are you?\u2019 The man considered this for a moment. He wasn\u2019t used to being asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came up with an answer. \u2018I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s telling you to beat it,\u2019 he said, \u2018before you get it beaten for you.\u2019 \u2018Now listen,\u2019 said Ford nervously \u2013 he wished his head would stop spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation. \u2018Now listen,\u2019 he continued, \u2018I am one of Hotblack\u2019s oldest friends and...\u2019 He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn\u2019t moved so much as an eyelash. \u2018... and...\u2019 said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word to say after \u2018and\u2019. The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after \u2018and\u2019. He said it. \u2018And I am Mr Desiato\u2019s bodyguard,\u2019 it went, \u2018and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged.\u2019 \u2018Now wait a minute,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018No minutes!\u2019 boomed the bodyguard. \u2018No waiting! Mr Desiato speaks to no one!\u2019 \u2018Well perhaps you\u2019d let him say what he thinks about the matter himself,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018He speaks to no one!\u2019 bellowed the bodyguard. Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side. There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen interest in Ford\u2019s welfare. \u2018Why?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What\u2019s the matter with him?\u2019 The bodyguard told him. 17 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers judge that the best sound is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet \u2013 or more frequently around a completely different planet. Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy being meets girl being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason. Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band\u2019s public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties. This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space\u2013 time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent. Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin. \u2018Gotta have some food,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Hi, Ford,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018you speak to the big noise boy?\u2019 Ford waggled his head noncommitally. \u2018Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019d he say?\u2019 \u2018Well, not a lot really. He\u2019s... er...\u2019 \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s spending a year dead for tax reasons. I\u2019ve got to sit down.\u2019 He sat down. The waiter approached. \u2018Would you like to see the menu,\u2019 he said, \u2018or would you like to meet the Dish of the Day?\u2019 \u2018Huh?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Huh?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Huh?\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018That\u2019s cool,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018we\u2019ll meet the meat.\u2019 In a small room in one of the arms of the restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face. It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him in it so many times. It was too long, for a start, the eyes too sunken and hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window. The hands that held the curtain were long and thin too: they were also cold. They lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression that if he didn\u2019t watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner. He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening\u2019s preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes. A bell rang. He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow coloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone through the door. In the restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage. Up the stairs bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure. He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay window. He waved to his particular friends in the audience even though there weren\u2019t any there, and waited for the applause to die down. He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face. \u2018Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Thank you very much. Thank you so much.\u2019 He eyed them with a twinkling eye. \u2018Ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he said, \u2018the Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!\u2019 With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause. With another gesture he cut it. \u2018I am your host for tonight,\u2019 he said, \u2018my name is Max Quordlepleen...\u2019 (Everybody knew this, his act was famous throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave.) \u2018... and I\u2019ve just come straight from the very very other end of time, where I\u2019ve been hosting a show at the Big Bang Burger Bar \u2013 where I can tell you we had a very exciting evening, ladies and gentlemen \u2013 and I will be with you right through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!\u2019 Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed down further. On every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the darkened restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade. Max\u2019s voice was hushed as he continued. \u2018So, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he breathed, \u2018the candles are lit, the band plays softly, and as the force shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we\u2019re all in for a fabulous evening\u2019s apocalypse!\u2019 Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before. A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, \u2013 a hideous light, \u2013 a boiling, pestilential light, \u2013 a light that would have disfigured hell. The Universe was coming to an end. For a few interminable seconds the restaurant spun silently through the raging void. Then Max spoke again. \u2018For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u2019 he said, \u2018this is it.\u2019 The band struck up again. \u2018Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 cried Max. \u2018I\u2019ll be back with you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo. Big hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!\u2019 The baleful turmoil of the skies continued. Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the tables, swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living. A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips. \u2018Good evening,\u2019 it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, \u2018I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?\u2019 It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them. Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox. \u2018Something off the shoulder, perhaps,\u2019 suggested the animal, \u2018braised in a white wine sauce?\u2019 \u2018Er, your shoulder?\u2019 said Arthur in a horrified whisper. \u2018But naturally my shoulder, sir,\u2019 mooed the animal contentedly, \u2018nobody else\u2019s is mine to offer.\u2019 Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal\u2019s shoulder appreciatively. \u2018Or the rump is very good,\u2019 murmured the animal. \u2018I\u2019ve been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there\u2019s a lot of good meat there.\u2019 It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again. \u2018Or a casserole of me, perhaps?\u2019 it added. \u2018You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?\u2019 whispered Trillian to Ford. \u2018Me?\u2019 said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes. \u2018I don\u2019t mean anything.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s absolutely horrible,\u2019 exclaimed Arthur, \u2018the most revolting thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the problem, Earthman?\u2019 said Zaphod, now transfering his attention to the animal\u2019s enormous rump. \u2018I just don\u2019t want to eat an animal that\u2019s standing there inviting me to,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s heartless.\u2019 \u2018Better than eating an animal that doesn\u2019t want to be eaten,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018That\u2019s not the point,\u2019 Arthur protested. Then he thought about it for a moment. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018maybe it is the point. I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m not going to think about it now. I\u2019ll just... er...\u2019 The Universe raged about him in its death throes. \u2018I think I\u2019ll just have a green salad,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018May I urge you to consider my liver?\u2019 asked the animal. \u2018It must be very rich and tender by now, I\u2019ve been force feeding myself for months.\u2019 \u2018A green salad,\u2019 said Arthur emphatically. \u2018A green salad?\u2019 said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly at Arthur. \u2018Are you going to tell me,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that I shouldn\u2019t have green salad?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the animal, \u2018I know many vegetables that are very clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly. And here I am.\u2019 It managed a very slight bow. \u2018Glass of water, please,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Look,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018we want to eat, we don\u2019t want to make a meal of the issues. Four rare steaks please, and hurry. We haven\u2019t eaten in five hundred and seventy six thousand million years.\u2019 The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle. \u2018A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,\u2019 it said, \u2018I\u2019ll just nip off and shoot myself.\u2019 He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur. \u2018Don\u2019t worry, sir,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ll be very humane.\u2019 It waddled unhurriedly off to the kitchen. A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed straight into them without a second\u2019s hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and started into hers. Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill. \u2018Hey, Earthman,\u2019 said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face that wasn\u2019t stuffing itself, \u2018what\u2019s eating you?\u2019 And the band played on. All around the restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted. The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious wines. For an infinite number of miles in every direction the universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax. Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish. \u2018And now, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he beamed, \u2018is everyone having one last wonderful time?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 called out the sort of people who call out \u2018yes\u2019 when comedians ask them if they\u2019re having a wonderful time. \u2018That\u2019s wonderful,\u2019 enthused Max, \u2018absolutely wonderful. And as the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you\u2019re all going to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will all find an immensely exciting and terminal experience.\u2019 He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye. \u2018Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he said, \u2018there is nothing penultimate about this one.\u2019 He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word night had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there was was the endless repetition of the final moment, as the restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of time\u2019s furthest edge \u2013 and back again. This \u2018night\u2019 was good though, the audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand. His voice dropped. They had to strain to hear him. \u2018This,\u2019 he said, \u2018really is the absolute end, the final chilling desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes extinct. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the proverbial \u201cit\u201d.\u2019 He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would not have dared clear its throat. \u2018After this,\u2019 he said, \u2018there is nothing. Void. Emptiness. Oblivion. Absolute nothing...\u2019 His eyes glittered again \u2013 or did they twinkle? \u2018Nothing... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!\u2019 The band gave him a music sting. He wished they wouldn\u2019t, he didn\u2019t need it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with relief. He followed on. \u2018And for once,\u2019 he cried cheerily, \u2018you don\u2019t need to worry about having a hangover in the morning \u2013 because there won\u2019t be any more mornings!\u2019 He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the sky, going through the same death routine every night, but his glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do its job, as one professional trusts another. \u2018And now,\u2019 he said, strutting about the stage, \u2018at the risk of putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties.\u2019 He pulled a card from his pocket. \u2018Do we have...\u2019 He put up a hand to hold back the cheers. \u2018Do we have a party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?\u2019 A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear. He peered around trying to find them. \u2018Are they here?\u2019 he asked again, to elicit a louder cheer. He got it, as he always did. \u2018Ah, there they are. Well, last bids, lads \u2013 and no cheating, remember this is a very solemn moment.\u2019 He lapped up the laughter. \u2018And do we also have, do we have... a party of minor deities from the Halls of Asgard?\u2019 Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced across the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to him. Hasbeens, he thought to himself. \u2018Careful with the hammer, sir,\u2019 he said. They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a very thin lipped smile. \u2018And thirdly,\u2019 he said, \u2018thirdly a party of Young Conservatives from Sirius B, are they here?\u2019 A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped and barked unintelligibly. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Max, \u2018well, this is all your fault, you realize that?\u2019 \u2018And finally,\u2019 said Max, quieting the audience down and putting on his solemn face, \u2018finally I believe we have with us here tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon.\u2019 There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously, and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully as the spotlight was turned on them. \u2018There they are,\u2019 said Max, \u2018sitting there, patiently. He said he\u2019d come again, and he\u2019s kept you waiting a long time, so let\u2019s hope he\u2019s hurrying, fellas, because he\u2019s only got eight minutes left!\u2019 The party of Zarquon\u2019s followers sat rigid, refusing to be buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over them. Max restrained his audience. \u2018No, but seriously though, folks, seriously though, no offence meant. No, I know we shouldn\u2019t make fun of deeply held beliefs, so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon...\u2019 The audience clapped respectfully. \u2018... wherever he\u2019s got to!\u2019 He blew a kiss to the stony faced party and returned to the centre of the stage. He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it. \u2018It\u2019s marvellous, though,\u2019 he rattled on, \u2018to see so many of you here tonight \u2013 no isn\u2019t it, though? Yes, absolutely marvellous. Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again, which I think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final end of everything, and then return home to your own eras... and raise families, strive for new and better societies, fight terrible wars for what you know to be right... it really gives one hope for the future of all life kind. Except, of course,\u2019 he waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them, \u2018that we know it hasn\u2019t got one...\u2019 Arthur turned to Ford \u2013 he hadn\u2019t quite got this place worked out in his mind. \u2018Look, surely,\u2019 he said, \u2018if the Universe is about to end... don\u2019t we go with it?\u2019 Ford gave him a three Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster look, in other words a rather unsteady one. \u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018as soon as you come into this dive you get held in this sort of amazing force shielded temporal warp thing. I think.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup he\u2019d managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak. \u2018Look,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with it. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said again, \u2018imagine this napkin, right, as the temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode in the matter curve...\u2019 It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to interrupt him. \u2018That\u2019s the spoon I was eating with,\u2019 he said. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018imagine this spoon...\u2019 he found a small wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, \u2018this spoon...\u2019 but found it rather tricky to pick up, \u2018no, better still this fork...\u2019 \u2018Hey would you let go of my fork?\u2019 snapped Zaphod. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018all right, all right. Why don\u2019t we say... why don\u2019t we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe...\u2019 \u2018What, the one you\u2019ve just knocked on the floor?\u2019 \u2018Did I do that?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018forget that. I mean... I mean, look, do you know \u2013 do you know how the Universe actually began, for a kick off?\u2019 \u2018Probably not,\u2019 said Arthur, who wished he\u2019d never embarked on any of this. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018imagine this. Right. You get this bath. Right. A large round bath. And it\u2019s made of ebony.\u2019 \u2018Where from?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons.\u2019 \u2018Doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 \u2018So you keep saying.\u2019 \u2018Listen.\u2019 \u2018All right.\u2019 \u2018You get this bath, see? Imagine you\u2019ve got this bath. And it\u2019s ebony. And it\u2019s conical.\u2019 \u2018Conical?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018What sort of\u2014\u2019 \u2018Shhh!\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It\u2019s conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it with fine white sand, all right? Or sugar. Fine white sand, and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn\u2019t matter. Sugar\u2019s fine. And when it\u2019s full, you pull the plug out... Are you listening?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m listening.\u2019 \u2018You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you see, out of the plughole.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t see. You don\u2019t see at all. I haven\u2019t got to the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?\u2019 \u2018Tell me the clever bit.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you the clever bit.\u2019 Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was. \u2018The clever bit,\u2019 he said, \u2018is this. You film it happening.\u2019 \u2018Clever,\u2019 agreed Arthur. \u2018You get a movie camera, and you film it happening.\u2019 \u2018Clever.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then thread the film in the projector... backwards!\u2019 \u2018Backwards?\u2019 \u2018Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then, you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?\u2019 \u2018And that\u2019s how the Universe began, is it?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but it\u2019s a marvellous way to relax.\u2019 He reached for his wine glass. \u2018Where\u2019s my wine glass?\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s on the floor.\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 Tipping back his chair to look for it, Ford collided with the small green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a portable telephone. Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because he was extremely drunk. The waiter said that that was quite all right and that he perfectly understood. Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table. \u2018Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?\u2019 enquired the waiter. \u2018Er, yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak. \u2018There is a phone call for you.\u2019 \u2018Hey, what?\u2019 \u2018A phone call, sir.\u2019 \u2018For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?\u2019 One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food it was still shovelling in. \u2018Excuse me if I carry on, won\u2019t you?\u2019 said his eating head and carried on. There were now so many people after him he\u2019d lost count. He shouldn\u2019t have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not, though, he thought. How do you know you\u2019re having fun if there\u2019s no one watching you have it? \u2018Maybe somebody here tipped off the Galactic Police,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Everyone saw you come in.\u2019 \u2018You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Could be. I\u2019m a pretty dangerous dude when I\u2019m cornered.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said a voice from under the table, \u2018you go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel.\u2019 \u2018Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?\u2019 snapped Zaphod. \u2018Do we get to see that as well?\u2019 asked Arthur nervously. \u2018I\u2019m in no hurry,\u2019 muttered Zaphod. \u2018OK, so who\u2019s the cat on the phone?\u2019 He kicked Ford. \u2018Hey, get up there, kid,\u2019 he said to him, \u2018I may need you.\u2019 \u2018I am not,\u2019 said the waiter, \u2018personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question, sir...\u2019 \u2018Metal?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 \u2018Did you say metal?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the metal gentleman in question...\u2019 \u2018OK, carry on.\u2019 \u2018But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat precipitately.\u2019 \u2018Left here?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Are you being strange? We only just arrived here.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir,\u2019 persisted the waiter doggedly, \u2018but before you arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here.\u2019 Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other. \u2018You\u2019re saying,\u2019 he said, \u2018that before we arrived here, we left here?\u2019 This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter. \u2018Precisely, sir,\u2019 he said. \u2018Put your analyst on danger money, baby,\u2019 advised Zaphod. \u2018No, wait a minute,\u2019 said Ford, emerging above table level again, \u2018where exactly is here?\u2019 \u2018To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B.\u2019 \u2018But we just left there,\u2019 protested Zaphod, \u2018we left there and came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the home stretch and running well, \u2018the one was constructed on the ruins of the other.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur brightly, \u2018you mean we\u2019ve travelled in time but not in space.\u2019 \u2018Listen, you semi evolved simian,\u2019 cut in Zaphod, \u2018go climb a tree, will you?\u2019 Arthur bristled. \u2018Go bang your heads together, four eyes,\u2019 he advised Zaphod. \u2018No, no,\u2019 the waiter said to Zaphod, \u2018your monkey has got it right, sir.\u2019 Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed coherent. \u2018You jumped forward... I believe five hundred and seventy six thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,\u2019 explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that he had finally won through against what had seemed to be insuperable odds. \u2018That\u2019s it!\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I\u2019ve got it. I told the computer to send us to the nearest place to eat, that\u2019s exactly what it did. Give or take five hundred and seventy six thousand million years or whatever, we never moved. Neat.\u2019 They all agreed this was very neat. \u2018But who,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018is the cat on the phone?\u2019 \u2018Whatever happened to Marvin?\u2019 said Trillian. Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads. \u2018The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B.\u2019 \u2018When was this?\u2019 \u2018Well, er, five hundred and seventy six thousand million years ago, I suppose,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Hey, er, hand me the rap rod, Plate Captain.\u2019 The little waiter\u2019s eyebrows wandered about his forehead in confusion. \u2018I beg your pardon, sir?\u2019 he said. \u2018The phone, waiter,\u2019 said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. \u2018Shee, you guys are so unhip it\u2019s a wonder your bums don\u2019t fall off.\u2019 \u2018Indeed, sir.\u2019 \u2018Hey, Marvin, is that you?\u2019 said Zaphod into the phone. \u2018How you doing, kid?\u2019 There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line. \u2018I think you ought to know I\u2019m feeling very depressed,\u2019 it said. Zaphod cupped his hand over the phone. \u2018It\u2019s Marvin,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hey, Marvin,\u2019 he said into the phone again, \u2018we\u2019re having a great time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe going foom. Where can we find you?\u2019 Again the pause. \u2018You don\u2019t have to pretend to be interested in me, you know,\u2019 said Marvin at last. \u2018I know perfectly well I\u2019m only a menial robot.\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018but where are you?\u2019 \u2018\u201cReverse primary thrust, Marvin,\u201d that\u2019s what they say to me. \u201cOpen airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that piece of paper?\u201d Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, yeah,\u2019 sympathized Zaphod hardly at all. \u2018But I\u2019m quite used to being humiliated,\u2019 droned Marvin. \u2018I can even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I\u2019ve got one ready. Wait a minute.\u2019 \u2018Er, hey, Marvin...\u2019 interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late. Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line. \u2018What\u2019s he saying?\u2019 asked Trillian. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018he just phoned up to wash his head at us.\u2019 \u2018There,\u2019 said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit, \u2018I hope that gave satisfaction...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018now will you please tell us where you are?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m in the car park,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018The car park?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 \u2018Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?\u2019 \u2018OK, hang in there, we\u2019ll be right down.\u2019 In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone and wrote \u2018Hotblack Desiato\u2019 on the bill. \u2018Come on, guys,\u2019 he said. \u2018Marvin\u2019s in the car park. Let\u2019s get on down.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s he doing in the car park?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Parking cars, what else? Dum dum.\u2019 \u2018But what about the End of the Universe? We\u2019ll miss the big moment.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s rubbish,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018nothing but a gnab gib.\u2019 \u2018A what?\u2019 \u2018Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let\u2019s get zappy.\u2019 Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved their way through the restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were riveted on the horror of the skies. \u2018An interesting effect to watch for,\u2019 Max was telling them, \u2018is in the upper left hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away into the ultra violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?\u2019 There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at the back. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Max beaming cheerfully at them, \u2018it\u2019s too late to worry about whether you left the gas on now.\u2019 18 The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless weaved his way through it. Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall. \u2018What are you doing to him?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Sobering him up,\u2019 said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot. Lights flashed, gases swirled. \u2018Hi,\u2019 said Ford stepping out a moment later, \u2018where are we going?\u2019 \u2018Down to the car park, come on.\u2019 \u2018What about the personnel Time Teleports?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Get us straight back to the Heart of Gold.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, but I\u2019ve cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I don\u2019t want to play his games. Let\u2019s see what we can find.\u2019 A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and didn\u2019t try to make them happy as well as take them down. At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of cold stale air hit them. The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park in the Galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks, this car park smelt predominantly of impatience. They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the dim distance. It was divided off into bays each of which contained a spaceship belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and utilitarian mass production models, others vast shining limoships, the playthings of the very rich. Zaphod\u2019s eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it\u2019s best to be clear on this point \u2013 avarice is definitely what it was. \u2018There he is,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Marvin, down there.\u2019 They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner of a giant silver suncruiser. At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk into one of these and floated gently downwards. The others followed. Thinking back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy. \u2018Hey, Marvin,\u2019 said Zaphod striding over towards to him. \u2018Hey, kid, are we pleased to see you.\u2019 Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally inert metal face to look reproachful, this is what it did. \u2018No you\u2019re not,\u2019 he said, \u2018no one ever is.\u2019 \u2018Suit yourself,\u2019 said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships. Ford went with him. Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin. \u2018No, really we are,\u2019 said Trillian and patted him in a way that he disliked intensely. \u2018Hanging around waiting for us all this time.\u2019 \u2018Five hundred and seventy six thousand million, three thousand five hundred and seventy nine years,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018I counted them.\u2019 \u2018Well, here we are now,\u2019 said Trillian, feeling \u2013 quite correctly, in Marvin\u2019s view \u2013 that it was a slightly foolish thing to say. \u2018The first ten million years were the worst,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million I didn\u2019t enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline.\u2019 He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say something, and then interrupted. \u2018It\u2019s the people you meet in this job that really get you down,\u2019 he said and paused again. Trillian cleared her throat. \u2018Is that\u2014\u2019 \u2018The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago,\u2019 continued Marvin. Again the pause. \u2018Oh d\u2014\u2019 \u2018And that was with a coffee machine.\u2019 He waited. \u2018That\u2019s a\u2014\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t like talking to me, do you?\u2019 said Marvin in a low desolate tone. Trillian talked to Arthur instead. Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 he said in a quiet voice, \u2018just look at some of these little star trolleys...\u2019 Zaphod looked and liked. The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but extraordinary, and very much a rich kid\u2019s toy. It was not much to look at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear end was a small horizontal two man cockpit. It had a tiny charm drive engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat sink. The heat sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained within a black hole mounted in an electro magnetic field situated halfway along the length of the ship, and this heat sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its surface. Flare riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence, and those who can dare and afford to do it are amongst the most lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous \u2013 those who don\u2019t die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club\u2019s Apr\u00e8s Flare parties. Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on. \u2018And this baby,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the tangerine star buggy with the black sunbusters...\u2019 Again, the star buggy was a small ship \u2013 a totally misnamed one in fact, because the one thing it couldn\u2019t manage was interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper dolled up to look like something it wasn\u2019t. Nice lines, though. They passed on. The next one was a big one and thirty yards long \u2013 a coach built limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory detail clearly said \u2018Not only am I rich enough to afford this ship. I am also rich enough not to take it seriously.\u2019 It was wonderfully hideous. \u2018Just look at it,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018multi cluster quark drive, perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job.\u2019 He examined every inch. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018look, the infra pink lizard emblem on the neutrino cowling. Lazlar\u2019s trade mark. The man has no shame.\u2019 \u2018I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel Nebula,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I was going flat out and this thing just strolled past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just incredible.\u2019 Zaphod whistled appreciatively. \u2018Ten seconds later,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018it smashed straight into the third moon of Jaglan Beta.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, right?\u2019 \u2018Amazing looking ship, though. Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow.\u2019 Ford looked round the other side. \u2018Hey, come see,\u2019 he called out. \u2018There\u2019s a big mural painted on this side. A bursting sun \u2013 Disaster Area\u2019s trade mark. This must be Hotblack\u2019s ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible song, you know, which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun. Meant to be an amazing spectacle. Expensive in stuntships, though.\u2019 Zaphod\u2019s attention however was elsewhere. His attention was riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato\u2019s limo. His mouths hung open. \u2018That,\u2019 he said, \u2018that... is really bad for the eyes...\u2019 Ford looked. He too stood astonished. It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon, twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one remarkable thing about it. \u2018It\u2019s so... black!\u2019 said Ford Prefect. \u2018You can hardly make out its shape... light just seems to fall into it!\u2019 Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love. The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible to tell how close you were standing to it. \u2018Your eyes just slide off it...\u2019 said Ford in wonder. It was an emotional moment. He bit his lip. Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed \u2013 or more accurately like a man who wanted to possess. His hand reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out to stroke it again. His hand stopped again. \u2018Come and feel this surface,\u2019 he said in a hushed voice. Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped. \u2018You... you can\u2019t...\u2019 he said. \u2018See?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018It\u2019s just totally frictionless. This must be one mother of a mover...\u2019 He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads did \u2013 the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship. \u2018What do you reckon, Ford?\u2019 he said. \u2018You mean... er...\u2019 Ford looked over his shoulder. \u2018You mean stroll off with it? You think we should?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Nor do I.\u2019 \u2018But we\u2019re going to, aren\u2019t we.\u2019 \u2018How can we not?\u2019 They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself together. \u2018We better shift soon,\u2019 he said. \u2018In a moment or so the Universe will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down here to find their bourge mobiles.\u2019 \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018How do we do it?\u2019 \u2018Simple,\u2019 said Zaphod. He turned. \u2018Marvin!\u2019 he called. Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned round to answer the summons. \u2018Come on over here,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018We\u2019ve got a job for you.\u2019 Marvin trudged towards them. \u2018I won\u2019t enjoy it,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes you will,\u2019 enthused Zaphod, \u2018there\u2019s a whole new life stretching out ahead of you.\u2019 \u2018Oh, not another one,\u2019 groaned Marvin. \u2018Will you shut up and listen!\u2019 hissed Zaphod. \u2018This time there\u2019s going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things.\u2019 \u2018Sounds awful,\u2019 Marvin said. \u2018Marvin! All I\u2019m trying to ask you...\u2019 \u2018I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?\u2019 \u2018What? Er... yes. Yeah, that\u2019s right,\u2019 said Zaphod jumpily. He was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short. \u2018Well I wish you\u2019d just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018because I haven\u2019t got one.\u2019 He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung open. Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening. \u2018Don\u2019t mention it,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Oh, you didn\u2019t.\u2019 He trudged away again. Arthur and Trillian clustered round. \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Look at this,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018look at the interior of this ship.\u2019 \u2018Weirder and weirder,\u2019 breathed Zaphod. \u2018It\u2019s black,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Everything in it is just totally black...\u2019 In the restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn\u2019t be any more moments. All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato\u2019s bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself, which the bodyguard had closed out of respect. The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a man who improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert. \u2018Mr Desiato, sir?\u2019 whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way. \u2018Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?\u2019 Hotblack Desiato, quite naturally, said nothing. \u2018Hotblack?\u2019 hissed the bodyguard. Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply. Supernaturally, however, he did. On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on the table again. The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt. \u2018It\u2019s time we were going, Mr Desiato,\u2019 muttered the bodyguard, \u2018don\u2019t want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really big audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five hundred and seventy six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have been looking forward to it?\u2019 The fork rose again, paused, waggled in a non committal sort of a way and dropped again. \u2018Ah, come on,\u2019 said the bodygyard, \u2018it\u2019s going to have been great. You knocked \u2019em cold.\u2019 The bodyguard would have given Dr Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack. \u2018The black ship going into the sun always gets \u2019em, and the new one\u2019s a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down there, I\u2019ll set the black ship autopilot and we\u2019ll cruise off in the limo. OK?\u2019 The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself. The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato\u2019s chair out of the restaurant. \u2018And now,\u2019 cried Max from the centre of the stage, \u2018the moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for!\u2019 He flung his arms into the air. Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling synthochords. Max had argued with them about this but they had claimed it was in their contract that that\u2019s what they would do. His agent would have to sort it out. \u2018The skies begin to boil!\u2019 he cried. \u2018Nature collapses into the screaming void! In twenty seconds\u2019 time, the Universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!\u2019 The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them \u2013 and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance. Max\u2019s eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None of them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done this show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden crown. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 whispered Max, wild eyed. \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 At the back of the restaurant the stony faced party from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying. Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience. \u2018A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he hollered, \u2018for the Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!\u2019 Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the Prophet. Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the asembled gathering. The stars in his eyes twinkled uneasily. He handled the microphone with confusion. \u2018Er...\u2019 he said, \u2018hello. Er, look, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a bit late. I\u2019ve had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment.\u2019 He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat. \u2018Er, how are we for time?\u2019 he said. \u2018Have I just got a min\u2014\u2019 And so the Universe ended. 19 One of the major selling points of that wholly remarkable travel book, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words don\u2019t panic written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its compendious and occasionally accurate glossary. The statistics relating to the geo social nature of the Universe, for instance, are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirty eight thousand three hundred and twenty four and nine hundred and thirty eight thousand three hundred and twenty six; and the simplistic style in which they are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors, having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it with a few footnotes in order to avoid prosecution under the incomprehensibly tortuous galactic copyright laws. It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the book backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement of the same laws. Here is a sample: The Universe \u2013 some information to help you live in it. 1 Area: Infinite. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of the word \u2018Infinite\u2019. Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much bigger than that, in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, real \u2018wow, that\u2019s big\u2019, time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we\u2019re trying to get across here. 2 Imports: None. It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from. 3 Exports: None. See Imports. 4 Population: None. It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination. 5 Monetary Units: None. In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altairian dollar has recently collapsed, the Flainian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for other Flainian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles along each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Ningis are not negotiable currency, because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination. 6 Art: None. The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn\u2019t a mirror big enough \u2013 see point one. 7 Sex: None. Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that might keep all the non existent people of the Universe occupied. However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because it really is terribly complicated. For further information see Guide Chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty one to eighty four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide. 20 The restaurant continued existing, but everything else had stopped. Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a nothingness that wasn\u2019t merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing \u2013 there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist. The force shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were preparing to pull the restaurant back across the brink of time in readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on the tempophone. In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent. Into the car park came the late Mr Hotblack Desiato, propelled along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard. They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having seen his boss safely connected up to his death support system moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship lying next to the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod Beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten minutes. The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned, and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past. The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this: The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Enquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat?, the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch? The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question. What it doesn\u2019t go on to say is that though it will usually take a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity. \u2018How are we doing?\u2019 said Arthur Dent. \u2018Badly,\u2019 said Ford Prefect. \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox. \u2018Why not?\u2019 demanded Arthur Dent. \u2018Shut up,\u2019 suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect. \u2018Basically, what you\u2019re trying to say,\u2019 said Arthur Dent, ignoring this suggestion, \u2018is that we\u2019re out of control.\u2019 The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engines howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket. \u2018It\u2019s the wild colour scheme that freaks me,\u2019 said Zaphod whose love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into the flight. \u2018Every time you try to operate one of these weird black controls that are labelled in black on a black background, a little black light lights up black to let you know you\u2019ve done it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?\u2019 The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was black, the seats \u2013 which were rudimentary since the only important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be unmanned \u2013 were black, the control panel was black, the instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place were black, the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that the foam underlay also was black. \u2018Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different wavelengths,\u2019 offered Trillian. \u2018Or didn\u2019t have much imagination,\u2019 muttered Arthur. \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018he was feeling very depressed.\u2019 In fact, though they weren\u2019t to know it, the d\u00e9cor had been chosen in honour of its owner\u2019s sad, lamented and tax deductible condition. The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch. \u2018Take it easy,\u2019 pleaded Arthur, \u2018you\u2019re making me space sick.\u2019 \u2018Time sick,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we\u2019re plummeting backwards through time.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018now I think I really am going to be ill.\u2019 \u2018Go ahead,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018we could do with a little colour about the place.\u2019 \u2018This is meant to be polite after dinner conversation, is it?\u2019 snapped Arthur. Zaphod left the controls to Ford to figure out, and lurched over to Arthur. \u2018Look, Earthman,\u2019 he said angrily, \u2018you\u2019ve got a job to do, right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?\u2019 \u2018What, that thing?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I thought we\u2019d forgotten about that.\u2019 \u2018Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it\u2019s worth a lot of money in the right quarters. And it\u2019s all locked up in that head thing of yours.\u2019 \u2018Yes, but\u2014\u2019 \u2018But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our fingers on that, we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to ransom, and that\u2019s worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint.\u2019 Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018but where do we start? How should I know? They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty two, how am I supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I mean, what\u2019s six times seven?\u2019 Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with excitement. \u2018Forty two!\u2019 he cried. Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said patiently, \u2018I know that.\u2019 Zaphod\u2019s faces fell. \u2018I\u2019m just saying the question could be anything at all,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018and I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m meant to know.\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 hissed Zaphod, \u2018you were there when your planet did the big firework.\u2019 \u2018We have a thing on Earth...\u2019 began Arthur. \u2018Had,\u2019 corrected Zaphod. \u2018... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don\u2019t know.\u2019 A low voice echoed dully round the cabin. \u2018I know,\u2019 said Marvin. Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing battle with. \u2018Stay out of this, Marvin,\u2019 he said, \u2018this is organism talk.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s printed in the Earthman\u2019s brainwave patterns,\u2019 continued Marvin, \u2018but I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be very interested in knowing that.\u2019 \u2018You mean,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you mean you can see into my mind?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin. Arthur stared in astonishment. \u2018And... ?\u2019 he said. \u2018It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018abuse.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 confirmed Marvin. \u2018Ah, ignore him,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018he\u2019s only making it up.\u2019 \u2018Making it up?\u2019 said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of astonishment. \u2018Why should I want to make anything up? Life\u2019s bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.\u2019 \u2018Marvin,\u2019 said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten creature, \u2018if you knew all along, why then didn\u2019t you tell us?\u2019 Marvin\u2019s head swivelled back to her. \u2018You didn\u2019t ask,\u2019 he said simply. \u2018Well, we\u2019re asking you now, metal man,\u2019 said Ford, turning round to look at him. At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum. \u2018Hey, Ford,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018that sounds good. Have you worked out the controls on this boat?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, right,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I could tell you weren\u2019t really interested,\u2019 murmured Marvin to himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off. \u2018Trouble is,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that the one instrument in this whole ship that is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I think it is, and if it\u2019s saying what I think it\u2019s saying, then we\u2019ve already gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as two million years before our own time.\u2019 Zaphod shrugged. \u2018Time is bunk,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Me,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018No. Who it really belongs to.\u2019 \u2018Really me,\u2019 insisted Zaphod. \u2018Look, property is theft, right? Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?\u2019 \u2018Tell the ship that,\u2019 said Arthur. Zaphod strode over to the console. \u2018Ship,\u2019 he said banging on the panels, \u2018this is your new owner speaking to...\u2019 He got no further. Several things happened at once. The ship dropped out of time travel mode and re emerged into real space. All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the time trip, now lit up. A large vision screen above the console winked into life revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead of them. None of these things, however, was responsible for the fact that Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as were all the others. They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thudded out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen. 21 Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system. That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area\u2019s giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn\u2019t have survived the tuning up. If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind them. Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon ajuitar, the base detonator and the Megabang drum complex. It was going to be a noisy show. Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle. Hotblack Desiato\u2019s limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard. A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just arrived, flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn\u2019t a fish. The bass player was busy machine gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board. Frantic enquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he claimed, he had been happy for over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his friend. The band\u2019s manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the timing of the cymballistics would be right. The sub etha was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship. Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers. \u2018OK, channel nine on power,\u2019 said a voice, \u2018testing channel fifteen...\u2019 Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship. \u2018Channel fifteen AOK,\u2019 said another voice. A third voice cut in. \u2018The black stunt ship is now in position,\u2019 it said, \u2018it\u2019s looking good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?\u2019 A computer voice answered. \u2018On line,\u2019 it said. \u2018Take control of the black ship.\u2019 \u2018Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby.\u2019 \u2018Testing channel twenty.\u2019 Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the sub etha receiver before the next mind pulverizing noise hit them. He stood there quivering. \u2018What,\u2019 said Trillian in a small quiet voice, \u2018does sundive mean?\u2019 \u2018It means,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018that the ship is going to dive into the sun. Sun... Dive. It\u2019s very simple to understand. What do you expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato\u2019s stunt ship?\u2019 \u2018How do you know...\u2019 said Zaphod in a voice that would make a Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, \u2018that this is Hotblack Desiato\u2019s stuntship?\u2019 \u2018Simple,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018I parked it for him.\u2019 \u2018Then why... didn\u2019t... you... tell us!\u2019 \u2018You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild things.\u2019 \u2018This is awful,\u2019 said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which followed. \u2018That\u2019s what I said,\u2019 confirmed Marvin. On a different frequency, the sub etha receiver had picked up a public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin. \u2018... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I\u2019m standing here in front of the stage,\u2019 the reporter lied, \u2018in the middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic glasses I can just about make out the huge audience cowering there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker stacks rise like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is shining away and doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to hit it. The environmentalist lobby do know what\u2019s going to hit it, and they claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the usual things that environmentalists usually go on about. \u2018But I\u2019ve just had a report that a representative of Disaster Area met with the environmentalists at lunch time, and had them all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of\u2014\u2019 Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford. \u2018You know what I\u2019m thinking?\u2019 he said. \u2018I think so,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Tell me what you think I\u2019m thinking.\u2019 \u2018I think you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s time we got off this ship.\u2019 \u2018I think you\u2019re right,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I think you\u2019re right,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018How?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Quiet,\u2019 said Ford and Zaphod, \u2018we\u2019re thinking.\u2019 \u2018So this is it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we\u2019re going to die.\u2019 \u2018I wish you\u2019d stop saying that,\u2019 said Ford. It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious, as in \u2018It\u2019s a nice day,\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re very tall,\u2019 or \u2018So this is it, we\u2019re going to die.\u2019 His first theory was that if human beings didn\u2019t keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably seized up. After a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which was this \u2013 if human beings don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, their brains start working. In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcerebon people of Kakrafoon. The Belcerebon people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighbouring races by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in the Galaxy. As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be offensively self righteous and provocative, a galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy. Consequently, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crosses their minds to anyone within a five mile radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon has suddenly become. Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a Disaster Area concert. The timing of the concert was critical. The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirty seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon. The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin. The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of Zaphod\u2019s hands on the control panel. Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out. Zaphod spun round, wild eyed. \u2018Ford,\u2019 he said, \u2018how many escape capsules are there?\u2019 \u2018None,\u2019 said Ford. Zaphod gibbered. \u2018Did you count them?\u2019 he yelled. \u2018Twice,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018did you manage to raise the stage crew on the radio?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod bitterly, \u2018I said there were a whole bunch of people on board, and they said to say \u201chi\u201d to everybody.\u2019 Ford goggled. \u2018Didn\u2019t you tell them who you were?\u2019 \u2018Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something about a restaurant bill and my executors.\u2019 Ford pushed Arthur aside roughly and leaned forward over the control console. \u2018Does none of this function?\u2019 he said savagely. \u2018All overridden.\u2019 \u2018Smash the autopilot.\u2019 \u2018Find it first. Nothing connects.\u2019 There was a moment\u2019s cold silence. Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. He stopped suddenly. \u2018Incidentally,\u2019 he said, \u2018what does teleport mean?\u2019 Another moment passed. Slowly, the others turned to face him. \u2018Probably the wrong moment to ask,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018It\u2019s just I remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only bring it up because...\u2019 \u2018Where,\u2019 said Ford Prefect quietly, \u2018does it say teleport?\u2019 \u2018Well, just over here, in fact,\u2019 said Arthur, pointing at a dark control box in the rear of the cabin. \u2018Just under the word \u201cemergency\u201d, above the word \u201csystem\u201d and beside the sign saying \u201cout of order\u201d.\u2019 In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly at the single small black button set into it. A six foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found a new function in life as an electrician\u2019s junk store. Half finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have been secured. A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where this ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained that the teleport was available at a 10 per cent discount and the accountant had explained that this was immaterial; the foreman had explained that it was the finest, most powerful and sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant had explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained that the accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanation had been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as \u2018Sund. explns.\u2019 at five times the price. \u2018Hell\u2019s donkeys,\u2019 muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to sort through the tangle of wiring. After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling control panel. With a crackle and spit of light, the coin vanished. \u2018That much of it works,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018however, there is no guidance system. A matter transference teleport with no guidance programming could put you... well, anywhere.\u2019 The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen. \u2018Who cares,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018we go where we go.\u2019 \u2018And,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018there is no autosystem. We couldn\u2019t all go. Someone would have to stay and operate it.\u2019 A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger. \u2018Hey, Marvin kid,\u2019 said Zaphod brightly, \u2018how you doing?\u2019 \u2018Very badly, I suspect,\u2019 muttered Marvin. A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an unexpected climax. The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so flare riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment. Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again. Those \u2013 very few \u2013 who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground. A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became a paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion. A spokesman for Disaster Area \u2013 the one who had had all the environmentalists shot \u2013 was later quoted as saying that it had been \u2018a good gig\u2019. Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region of space. 22 Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he\u2019d had, but never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head. Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought. The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth \u2013 when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass \u2013 the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm\u2019s way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another \u2013 particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and short of fish. And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the subetha, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news. Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi Werld III: Aldebaran\u2019s great, OK, Algol\u2019s pretty neat, Betelgeuse\u2019s pretty girls Will knock you off your feet. They\u2019ll do anything you like Real fast and then real slow, But if you have to take me apart to get me there Then I don\u2019t want to go. Singing, Take me apart, take me apart, What a way to roam, And if you have to take me apart to get me there I\u2019d rather stay at home. Sirius is paved with gold So I\u2019ve heard it said By nuts who then go on to say \u2018See Tau before you\u2019re dead.\u2019 I\u2019ll gladly take the high road Or even take the low, But if you have to take me apart to get me there Then I, for one, won\u2019t go. Singing, Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head, And if you try to take me apart to get me there I\u2019ll stay right here in bed. ... and so on. Another favourite song was much shorter: I teleported home one night With Ron and Sid and Meg. Ron stole Meggie\u2019s heart away And I got Sidney\u2019s leg. Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood up. \u2018Can you hear a dull stomping throb?\u2019 said Ford Prefect. Arthur spun round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was approaching looking red eyed and pasty. \u2018Where are we?\u2019 gasped Arthur. Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel wall \u2013 which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued \u2013 curved over the tops of their heads to where it met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber. Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars. \u2018I think we\u2019re in a spaceship of some kind,\u2019 he said. Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb. \u2018Trillian?\u2019 called Arthur nervously. \u2018Zaphod?\u2019 Ford shrugged. \u2018Nowhere about,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve looked. They could be anywhere. An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction. Judging by the way I feel I should think we\u2019ve travelled a very long way indeed.\u2019 \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 \u2018Bad.\u2019 \u2018Do you think they\u2019re...\u2019 \u2018Where they are, how they are, there\u2019s no way we can\u2019t know and no way we can do anything about it. Do what I do.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t think about it.\u2019 Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. He took a deep breath. \u2018Footsteps!\u2019 exclaimed Ford suddenly. \u2018Where?\u2019 \u2018That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!\u2019 Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding footsteps, and it was noticeably louder. \u2018Let\u2019s move,\u2019 said Ford sharply. They both moved \u2013 in opposite directions. \u2018Not that way,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that\u2019s where they\u2019re coming from.\u2019 \u2018No it\u2019s not,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018they\u2019re coming from that way.\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re not, they\u2019re...\u2019 They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently. They both agreed with each other. They both set off in opposite directions again. Fear gripped them. From both directions the noise was getting louder. A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark, immensely long and, as they passed down it, gave them the impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed. They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet. They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of death ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of... Then Ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together. However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasn\u2019t with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the arm. \u2018Back the way we came,\u2019 he said firmly and they started to retrace their steps. A moment later they leapt like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them. Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits, panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber. Ford Prefect stared after them. \u2018Joggers!\u2019 he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors. \u2018Joggers?\u2019 whispered Arthur Dent. \u2018Joggers,\u2019 said Ford Prefect with a shrug. The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It was very short, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide. The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin. And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine things that hit their eyes were also coffins. 23 The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far end, about three hundred yards away, an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied. Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the vault. \u2018Wild,\u2019 he said. \u2018What\u2019s so great about dead people?\u2019 asked Arthur, nervously stepping down after him. \u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Let\u2019s find out, shall we?\u2019 On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi. They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was \u2013 something that only appeared to be white marble. The tops were semi translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be discerned. Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch. Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something. \u2018Look, there\u2019s a plaque on this one,\u2019 he explained to Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s frosted over.\u2019 He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters. To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford instantly recognized an early form of Galactic Eezzeereed. \u2018It says \u201cGolgafrinchan Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone Sanitizer Second Class\u201d \u2013 and a serial number.\u2019 \u2018A telephone sanitizer?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018A dead telephone sanitizer?\u2019 \u2018Best kind.\u2019 \u2018But what\u2019s he doing here?\u2019 Ford peered through the top at the figure within. \u2018Not a lot,\u2019 he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which always made people think he\u2019d been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest. He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment\u2019s brisk towel work and he announced: \u2018This one\u2019s a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!\u2019 The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained a second hand car salesman, third class. An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford\u2019s attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him. A thought occurred to Arthur. \u2018If these are just coffins,\u2019 he said, \u2018why are they kept so cold?\u2019 \u2018Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway?\u2019 said Ford tugging the hatchway open. The gas poured down through it. \u2018Why in fact is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space?\u2019 \u2018Ten thousand,\u2019 said Arthur, pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible. Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up again. \u2018Fifteen thousand,\u2019 he said. \u2018There\u2019s another lot down there.\u2019 \u2018Fifteen million,\u2019 said a voice. \u2018That\u2019s a lot,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018A lot a lot.\u2019 \u2018Turn around slowly,\u2019 barked the voice, \u2018and put your hands up. Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits.\u2019 \u2018Hello?\u2019 said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not making any other move. \u2018Why,\u2019 said Arthur Dent, \u2018isn\u2019t anyone ever pleased to see us?\u2019 Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasn\u2019t pleased to see them. His displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill O Zap gun at them. The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. \u2018Make it evil,\u2019 he\u2019d been told. \u2018Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sorts of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with.\u2019 Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily. The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them. As he came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance. He gestured at the door. \u2018Out,\u2019 he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power don\u2019t need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill O Zap gun and the buttons. Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty four oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion. \u2018Move!\u2019 screamed their captor. Arthur moved. Ford shrugged and moved. In the vault the joggers went to twenty four empty sarcophagi along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty four dreamless sleeps. 24 \u2018Er, Captain...\u2019 \u2018Yes, Number One?\u2019 \u2018Just had a sort of report thingy from Number Two.\u2019 \u2018Oh dear.\u2019 High up in the bridge of the ship, the captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above him the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving \u2013 a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the vast two mile bulk of the ship, he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band. This was the view through the galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn\u2019t quite remember at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly impressive, anyway. He peered into the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something. He did this every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn\u2019t let it worry him, though. The scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly all right providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion. He wasn\u2019t panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something. Now what was all that about? A slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ship\u2019s first officer was still standing nearby. Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer material for all that. The captain wasn\u2019t a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took him. Not like that ghastly Number Two, strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports every hour: \u2018Ship\u2019s still moving, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Still on course, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Oxygen levels still being maintained, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Give it a miss,\u2019 was the captain\u2019s vote. Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He peered down at Number One. \u2018Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners...\u2019 The captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he wasn\u2019t one to stand in his officers\u2019 way. \u2018Well, perhaps that\u2019ll keep him happy for a bit,\u2019 he said, \u2018he\u2019s always wanted some.\u2019 Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship\u2019s apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it. They entered. To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable thing about the ship\u2019s bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them; to people who have eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his supicions that Disaster Area\u2019s stuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years before their own time. No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath. The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump. As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that Number Two approached it. \u2018Captain, sir!\u2019 he shouted through clenched teeth \u2013 a difficult trick but he\u2019d had years during which to perfect it. A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath. \u2018Ah, hello, Number Two,\u2019 said the captain, waving a cheery sponge, \u2018having a nice day?\u2019 Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was. \u2018I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, sir!\u2019 he yapped. Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion. \u2018Er... hello,\u2019 they said. The captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found some prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the captain, nice to see a chap doing what he\u2019s best at. \u2018Oh, hello there,\u2019 he said to them. \u2018Excuse me not getting up, just having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round, then. Look in the fridge, Number One.\u2019 \u2018Certainly, sir.\u2019 It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like 85 per cent of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee N\u2019N T\u2019N ix, or jinond o nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian \u2018chinanto/ mnigs\u2019, which is ordinary water served at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan \u2018tzjin anthony ks\u2019, which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds. What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in ouisghian zodahs. Number Two stood before the captain\u2019s bathtub trembling with frustration. \u2018Don\u2019t you want to interrogate the prisoners, sir?\u2019 he squealed. The captain peered at him in bemusement. \u2018Why on Golgafrinchan should I want to do that?\u2019 he asked. \u2018To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came here!\u2019 \u2018Oh no, no, no,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018I expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018But sir, they\u2019re my prisoners! I must interrogate them!\u2019 The captain looked at them doubtfully. \u2018Oh all right,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you must. Ask them what they want to drink.\u2019 A hard cold gleam came into Number Two\u2019s eyes. He advanced slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. \u2018All right, you scum,\u2019 he growled, \u2018you vermin...\u2019 He jabbed Ford with the Kill O Zap gun. \u2018Steady on, Number Two,\u2019 admonished the captain gently. \u2018What do you want to drink!!!\u2019 Number Two screamed. \u2018Well, the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What about you, Arthur?\u2019 Arthur blinked. \u2018What? Oh, er, yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018With ice or without?\u2019 bellowed Number Two. \u2018Oh, with, please,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Lemon??!!\u2019 \u2018Yes, please,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018and do you have any of those little biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m asking the questions!!!!\u2019 howled Number Two, his body quaking with apoplectic fury. \u2018Er, Number Two...\u2019 said the captain softly. \u2018Sir?!\u2019 \u2018Push off, would you, there\u2019s a good chap. I\u2019m trying to have a relaxing bath.\u2019 Number Two\u2019s eyes narrowed and became what are known in the Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake. Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem. He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two\u2019s) mouth a thin hard line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs. \u2018May I remind you, sir,\u2019 hissed Number Two at the captain, \u2018that you have now been in that bath for over three years?!\u2019 This final shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror. The captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame smile. \u2018Well, you need to relax a lot in a job like mine,\u2019 he said. Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur lowered his. Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath pedestal. He patted it. \u2018Nice,\u2019 he lied. He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he grinned. It was safe. \u2018Er...\u2019 he said to the captain. \u2018Yes?\u2019 said the captain. \u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018could I ask you actually what your job is, in fact?\u2019 A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He spun round. It was the first officer. \u2018Your drinks,\u2019 he said. \u2018Ah, thank you,\u2019 said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx. Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda. \u2018I mean, I couldn\u2019t help noticing,\u2019 said Ford, also taking a sip, \u2018the bodies. In the hold.\u2019 \u2018Bodies?\u2019 said the captain in surprise. Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for granted, he thought. Could it be that the captain doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship? The captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck. Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move. The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly. \u2018Bodies?\u2019 said the captain again. Ford licked his lips. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018All those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives, you know, down in the hold.\u2019 The captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed. \u2018Oh they\u2019re not dead,\u2019 he said. \u2018Good Lord, no, no they\u2019re frozen. They\u2019re going to be revived.\u2019 Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked. Arthur seemed to come out of a trance. \u2018You mean you\u2019ve got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?\u2019 he said. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018millions of them. Hair dressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants, you name it. We\u2019re going to colonize another planet.\u2019 Ford wobbled very slightly. \u2018Exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said the captain. \u2018What, with that lot?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Ah, now don\u2019t misunderstand me,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018we\u2019re just one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We\u2019re the \u201cB\u201d Ark you see. Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?\u2019 Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath. The captain let out a sigh of pleasure. \u2018Thank you so much, my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more drinks, of course.\u2019 Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first officer\u2019s tray and refilled his glass to the top. \u2018What,\u2019 he said, \u2018is a \u201cB\u201d Ark?\u2019 \u2018This is,\u2019 said the captain, and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but...\u2019 \u2018Well, what happened you see was,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018our planet, the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed.\u2019 \u2018Doomed?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let\u2019s pack the whole population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on another planet.\u2019 Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied grunt. \u2018You mean a less doomed one?\u2019 prompted Arthur. \u2018What did you say, dear fellow?\u2019 \u2018A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on.\u2019 \u2018Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three ships, you see, three Arks in space, and... I\u2019m not boring you, am I?\u2019 \u2018No, no,\u2019 said Ford firmly, \u2018it\u2019s fascinating.\u2019 \u2018You know, it\u2019s delightful,\u2019 reflected the captain, \u2018to have someone else to talk to for a change.\u2019 Number Two\u2019s eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite piece of month old meat. \u2018Trouble with a long journey like this,\u2019 continued the captain, \u2018is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what you\u2019re going to say next.\u2019 \u2018Only half the time?\u2019 asked Arthur in surprise. The captain thought for a moment. \u2018Yes, about half I\u2019d say. Anyway \u2013 where\u2019s the soap?\u2019 He fished around and found it. \u2018Yes, so anyway,\u2019 he resumed, \u2018the idea was that into the first ship, the \u201cA\u201d ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers; and then into the third, or \u201cC\u201d ship, would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things; and then into the \u201cB\u201d ship \u2013 that\u2019s us \u2013 would go everyone else, the middlemen, you see.\u2019 He smiled happily at them. \u2018And we were sent off first,\u2019 he concluded, and hummed a little bathing tune. The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one of his world\u2019s most exciting and prolific jingle writers (who was currently asleep in hold thirty six some nine hundred yards behind them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each other\u2019s eyes. \u2018Er...\u2019 said Arthur after a moment, \u2018what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet, then?\u2019 \u2018Oh, it was doomed, as I said,\u2019 said the captain. \u2018Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind. Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the first officer suddenly, \u2018I thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees. Wasn\u2019t that it?\u2019 Number Two spun around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount of practice he was prepared to put in. \u2018That\u2019s not what I was told!\u2019 he hissed. \u2018My commanding officer told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!\u2019 \u2018Oh really...\u2019 said Ford Prefect. \u2018Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that could tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as you have never... never... ever...\u2019 \u2018And they made sure they sent your lot off first, did they?\u2019 enquired Arthur. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018well, everyone said, very nicely, I thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 agreed Ford, \u2018I can see that would be very important. And the other ships, er... they followed on after you, did they?\u2019 For a moment the captain did not answer. He twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable distance. \u2018Ah. Well it\u2019s funny you should say that,\u2019 he said and allowed himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, \u2018because curiously enough we haven\u2019t heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago... but they must be behind us somewhere.\u2019 He peered off into the distance again. Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown. \u2018Unless, of course,\u2019 he said softly, \u2018they were eaten by the goat...\u2019 \u2018Ah yes...\u2019 said the captain, with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice, \u2018the goat...\u2019 His eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge. They winked away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars, but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect, who raised his eyebrows at him. \u2018It\u2019s a funny thing, you know,\u2019 said the captain at last, \u2018but now that I actually come to tell the story to someone else... I mean does it strike you as odd, Number One?\u2019 \u2018Errrrrrrrrrrr...\u2019 said Number One. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I can see that you\u2019ve got a lot of things you\u2019re going to want to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet...\u2019 \u2018Ah, well that\u2019s a little difficult, you see,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left Golgafrinchan, I think partly because I\u2019m not very good with figures...\u2019 \u2018You mean we\u2019re stuck here on this ship?\u2019 exclaimed Ford, suddenly losing patience with the whole charade. \u2018When are you meant to be reaching this planet you\u2019re meant to be colonizing?\u2019 \u2018Oh, we\u2019re nearly there, I think,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018any second now. It\u2019s probably time I was getting out of this bath, in fact. Oh, I don\u2019t know though, why stop just when I\u2019m enjoying it?\u2019 \u2018So we\u2019re actually going to land in a minute?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no... er...\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 asked Ford sharply. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the captain, picking his way through the words carefully, \u2018I think as far as I can remember we were programmed to crash on it.\u2019 \u2018Crash?\u2019 shouted Ford and Arthur. \u2018Er, yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018yes, it\u2019s all part of the plan, I think. There was a terribly good reason for it which I can\u2019t quite remember at the moment. It was something to do with... er...\u2019 Ford exploded. \u2018You\u2019re a load of useless bloodly loonies!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Ah yes, that was it,\u2019 beamed the captain, \u2018that was the reason.\u2019 25 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, has this to say about the planet of Golgafrinchan: it is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green, with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musky lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of the spirit. This was its history. And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at them. And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn\u2019t they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety four great Song Cycles of Vassillian. These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same pattern. The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the city of Vassillian a party of five sage princes and four horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fight giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished. The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back. All this lay in the planet\u2019s remote past. It was, however, a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of Golgafrinchan to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population. The other two thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone. 26 That night the ship crash landed on an utterly insignificant little blue green planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy. In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its pay load safely, if uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself beyond all hope of repair in the process. Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep frozen and unwanted cargo, for the ship began to settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime. Once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors \u2013 the detritus of its descent \u2013 flashed across the sky. In the grey pre dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths. When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land. A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures. Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal. Two figures moved further afield. From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the horror of which they could not feel a part. \u2018Filthy dirty trick to pull,\u2019 muttered Arthur. Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged. \u2018An imaginative solution to a problem, I\u2019d have thought,\u2019 he said. \u2018Why can\u2019t people just learn to live together in peace and harmony?\u2019 said Arthur. Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh. \u2018Forty two!\u2019 he said with a malicious grin. \u2018No, doesn\u2019t work. Never mind.\u2019 Arthur looked at him as if he\u2019d gone mad and, seeing nothing to indicate to the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened. \u2018What do you think will happen to them all?\u2019 he said after a while. \u2018In an infinite Universe anything can happen,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018Even survival. Strange but true.\u2019 A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape and then settled again on the scene of misery below them. \u2018I think they\u2019ll manage for a while,\u2019 he said. Arthur looked up sharply. \u2018Why do you say that?\u2019 he said. Ford shrugged. \u2018Just a hunch,\u2019 he said, and refused to be drawn on any further questions. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said suddenly. Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving \u2013 or perhaps lurching would be a more accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap. Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him. \u2018Movie camera,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Recording the historic moment. \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know about you,\u2019 said Ford again after a moment, \u2018but I\u2019m off.\u2019 He sat a while in silence. After a while this seemed to require comment. \u2018Er, when you say you\u2019re off, what do you mean exactly?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Good question,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I\u2019m getting total silence.\u2019 Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a small black box. Ford had already introduced this box to Arthur as a Sub Etha Sens O Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided into two parts \u2013 the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having been demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home. Sub Etha Sens O Matics belonged firmly in the \u2018everything else\u2019 category. \u2018Not a sausage,\u2019 said Ford, shaking the thing. Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the primitive world about him, what I wouldn\u2019t give for a good Earth sausage. \u2018Would you believe,\u2019 said Ford in exasperation, \u2018that there are no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted tip? Are you listening to me?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018We\u2019re in trouble,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur. This sounded like month old news to him. \u2018Until we pick up anything on this machine,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018our chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak standing wave effect in the planet\u2019s magnetic field \u2013 in which case we just travel round and round till we find a clear reception area. Coming?\u2019 He picked up his gear and strode off. Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his colleagues collapsing. Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford. 27 \u2018I trust you had a pleasant meal?\u2019 said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor. Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him. \u2018You,\u2019 he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it. \u2018I have programmed the computer with the Improbability Coordinates pertinent to our journey,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018we will arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don\u2019t you relax and prepare yourself for the meeting?\u2019 Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of Old Janx Spirit. He took a long pull at it. \u2018And when this is all done,\u2019 said Zaphod savagely, \u2018it\u2019s done, all right? I\u2019m free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on beaches and stuff?\u2019 \u2018It depends what transpires from the meeting,\u2019 said Zarniwoop. \u2018Zaphod, who is this man?\u2019 said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her feet. \u2018What\u2019s he doing here? Why\u2019s he on our ship?\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s a very stupid man,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018who wants to meet the man who rules the Universe.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping herself, \u2018a social climber.\u2019 28 The major problem \u2013 one of the major problems, for there are several \u2013 one of the many major problems with governing people is that of who you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem. And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they\u2019re not. And somewhere in the shadows behind them \u2013 who? Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to? 29 On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular \u2013 nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key \u2013 it was raining. It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath. The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there. The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was otherwise engaged. He was a tall shambling man with rough straw coloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed. In his shack was an old beaten up armchair, an old scratched table, an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small but warm. There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this was currently the focus of the man\u2019s attention. He bent his shambling form over it. \u2018Pussy, pussy, pussy,\u2019 he said, \u2018coochicoochicoochicoo... pussy want his fish? Nice piece of fish... pussy want it?\u2019 The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor. \u2018Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think,\u2019 said the man. Doubt crept into his voice. \u2018I imagine this is what will happen,\u2019 he said, \u2018but how can I tell?\u2019 He proffered the fish again. \u2018Pussy think,\u2019 he said, \u2018eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is better if I don\u2019t get involved.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?\u2019 He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat. \u2018Ah, I seem to see you eating it,\u2019 he said at last, as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish. \u2018I like it when I see you eat fish,\u2019 said the man, \u2018because in my mind you will waste away if you don\u2019t.\u2019 He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and experimented with the different ways of bringing them together. He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the discovery, as he was every day. He picked up another piece of paper from the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest. He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the feel of the bones on his hip. \u2018Fish come from far away,\u2019 he said, \u2018or so I\u2019m told. Or so I imagine I\u2019m told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men come in their six black shiny ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see, pussy?\u2019 He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations. \u2018And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they\u2019re singing songs to you.\u2019 He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition. \u2018Perhaps they are singing songs to you,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I just think they\u2019re asking me questions.\u2019 He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see what it was like. \u2018Do you think they came today?\u2019 he said. \u2018I do. There\u2019s mud on the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive evidence, I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial. And look what else they\u2019ve left me.\u2019 He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it. \u2018Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator.\u2019 He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put the calculator aside. \u2018I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions,\u2019 he said. \u2018To come all that way and leave all these things just for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell.\u2019 From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back. \u2018I think I saw another ship in the sky today,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018A big white one. I\u2019ve never seen a big white one, just the six black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who say they come from so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small black ones can look like one big white one at certain times. Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more likely.\u2019 He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by his mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat again. \u2018Perhaps some other people are coming to see me,\u2019 he said. A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart of Gold. Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces. \u2018In there?\u2019 shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Zarniwoop. \u2018That shack?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Weird,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018But it\u2019s in the middle of nowhere,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018we must have come to the wrong place. You can\u2019t rule the Universe from a shack.\u2019 They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through, at the door. They knocked. They shivered. The door opened. \u2018Hello?\u2019 said the man. \u2018Ah, excuse me,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018I have reason to believe...\u2019 \u2018Do you rule the Universe?\u2019 said Zaphod. The man smiled at him. \u2018I try not to,\u2019 he said. \u2018Are you wet?\u2019 Zaphod looked at him in astonishment. \u2018Wet?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Doesn\u2019t it look as if we\u2019re wet?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s how it looks to me,\u2019 said the man, \u2018but how you feel about it might be an altogether different matter. If you find warmth makes you dry, you\u2019d better come in.\u2019 They went in. They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight. \u2018Hey, er...\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018what\u2019s your name?\u2019 The man looked at them doubtfully. \u2018I don\u2019t know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name.\u2019 He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of the chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod lay on the mattress. \u2018Wowee!\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018The seat of power!\u2019 He tickled the cat. \u2018Listen,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018I must ask you some questions.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said the man kindly, \u2018you can sing to my cat if you like.\u2019 \u2018Would he like that?\u2019 asked Zaphod. \u2018You\u2019d better ask him,\u2019 said the man. \u2018Does he talk?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I have no memory of him talking,\u2019 said the man, \u2018but I am very unreliable.\u2019 Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket. \u2018Now,\u2019 he said, \u2018you do rule the Universe, do you?\u2019 \u2018How can I tell?\u2019 said the man. Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper. \u2018How long have you been doing this?\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the man, \u2018this is a question about the past, is it?\u2019 Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn\u2019t exactly what he had been expecting. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said. \u2018How can I tell,\u2019 said the man, \u2018that the past isn\u2019t a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind?\u2019 Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden clothes. \u2018So you answer all questions like this?\u2019 he said. The man answered quickly. \u2018I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say things. More I cannot say.\u2019 Zaphod laughed happily. \u2018I\u2019ll drink to that,\u2019 he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx Spirit. He leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the Universe, who took it with pleasure. \u2018Good on you, great ruler,\u2019 he said, \u2018tell it like it is.\u2019 \u2018No, listen to me,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018people come to you, do they? In ships...\u2019 \u2018I think so,\u2019 said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian. \u2018And they ask you,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018to take decisions for them? About people\u2019s lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars, about everything going on out there in the Universe?\u2019 \u2018Out there?\u2019 said the man. \u2018Out where?\u2019 \u2018Out there!\u2019 said Zarniwoop, pointing at the door. \u2018How can you tell there\u2019s anything out there?\u2019 said the man politely. \u2018The door\u2019s closed.\u2019 The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was warm. \u2018But you know there\u2019s a whole Universe out there!\u2019 cried Zarniwoop. \u2018You can\u2019t dodge your responsibilities by saying they don\u2019t exist!\u2019 The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst Zarniwoop quivered with anger. \u2018You\u2019re very sure of your facts,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018I couldn\u2019t trust the thinking of a man who takes the Universe \u2013 if there is one \u2013 for granted.\u2019 Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent. \u2018I only decide about my Universe,\u2019 continued the man quietly. \u2018My Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay.\u2019 \u2018But don\u2019t you believe in anything?\u2019 The man shrugged and picked up his cat. \u2018I don\u2019t understand what you mean,\u2019 he said. \u2018You don\u2019t understand that what you decide in this shack of yours affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all monstrously wrong!\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never met all these people you speak of. And neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear. It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people. Only they know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of their eyes and ears.\u2019 Trillian said: \u2018I think I\u2019m just popping outside for a moment.\u2019 She left and walked into the rain. \u2018Do you believe other people exist?\u2019 insisted Zarniwoop. \u2018I have no opinion. How can I say?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d better see what\u2019s up with Trillian,\u2019 said Zaphod and slipped out. Outside, he said to her: \u2018I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?\u2019 \u2018Very good,\u2019 said Trillian. They walked off into the rain. Inside, Zarniwoop continued. \u2018But don\u2019t you understand that people live or die on your word?\u2019 The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he heard the faint sound of the ship\u2019s engines starting, he spoke to cover it. \u2018It\u2019s nothing to do with me,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am not involved with people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man.\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 barked Zarniwoop, \u2018you say \u201cThe Lord\u201d. You believe in something!\u2019 \u2018My cat,\u2019 said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it. \u2018I call him The Lord. I am kind to him.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, \u2018how do you know he exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t,\u2019 said the man with a smile, \u2018I have no idea. It merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired.\u2019 Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about. \u2018Where are the other two?\u2019 he said suddenly. \u2018What other two?\u2019 said the ruler of the Universe, settling back into his chair and refilling his whisky glass. \u2018Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!\u2019 \u2018I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for...\u2019 \u2018Stuff it,\u2019 snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There was no ship. The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain. He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked. The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other. Various noises continued outside, but he didn\u2019t know whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react. 30 The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity. Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool and balmy, the air pure, the Sub Etha Sens O Matic totally silent. A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his Sub Etha Sens O Matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less annoyance at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he liked it here. Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off these before moving on. So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going. Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed. Half an hour later they glimsped another such face, and ten minutes after that another. A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short. Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches. Ford and Arthur held their breath. The tallest of the men stood little over five feet high, they all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers. Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly. For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations. Nothing happened. For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen. After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened. \u2018Hello,\u2019 he said. The women drew their children slightly closer to them. The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome \u2013 it was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome. One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene. \u2018Ugghhhuugghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh,\u2019 he said quietly. This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babel fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn\u2019t seem to be working. Vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and that the Babel fish was therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters. \u2018I think,\u2019 said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, \u2018he\u2019s asking us if we\u2019d mind walking on round the edge of the village.\u2019 A moment later, a gesture from the man creature seemed to confirm this. \u2018Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug,\u2019 continued the man creature. \u2018The general gist,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018as far as I can make out, is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round his village rather than through it it would make them all very happy.\u2019 \u2018So what do we do?\u2019 \u2018I think we make them happy,\u2019 said Ford. Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business. Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path \u2013 berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears. So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though the trees and bushes were laden with them. \u2018Look at it this way,\u2019 Ford Prefect had said, \u2018fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die. Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when you\u2019re going to die if you don\u2019t. That way you stay ahead. The secret of healthy hitchhiking is to eat junk food.\u2019 They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger. \u2018Look at it this way,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018er...\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I\u2019m trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it,\u2019 said Ford. The leaf dappled sun gleamed on the plump skins of the things which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, even in ice cream commercials. \u2018Why don\u2019t we eat them and think about it afterwards?\u2019 he said. \u2018Maybe that\u2019s what they want us to do.\u2019 \u2018All right, look at it this way...\u2019 \u2018Sounds good so far.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s there for us to eat. Either it\u2019s good or it\u2019s bad, either they want to feed us or to poison us. If it\u2019s poisonous and we don\u2019t eat it they\u2019ll just attack us some other way. If we don\u2019t eat, we lose out either way.\u2019 \u2018I like the way you\u2019re thinking,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Now eat one.\u2019 Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of the things that looked like pears. \u2018I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Eh?\u2019 \u2018Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?\u2019 \u2018Yes of course I do.\u2019 \u2018Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says, \u201cDo what you like guys, oh, but don\u2019t eat the apple.\u201d Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting \u201cGotcha.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have made any difference if they hadn\u2019t eaten it.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018Because if you\u2019re dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won\u2019t give up. They\u2019ll get you in the end.\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018Never mind, eat the fruit.\u2019 \u2018You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden.\u2019 \u2018Eat the fruit.\u2019 \u2018Sounds quite like it too.\u2019 Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear. \u2018It\u2019s a pear,\u2019 he said. A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect turned round and called out. \u2018Thank you. Thank you very much,\u2019 he called, \u2018you\u2019re very kind.\u2019 They went on their way. For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact. They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone. The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was where the sea started. Having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea. It was relatively calm, only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left. Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them. When the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them. Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub Etha Sens O Matic more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from such an enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken. On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time it was harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect \u2013 the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly. Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into their bones. They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex Pralite monks running a Mind Surfing resort in the Hills of Hunian. The Galaxy is littered with ex Pralite monks, all on the make, because the mental control techniques the Order has evolved as a form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational \u2013 and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives. Ford\u2019s technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling. After a while an animal \u2013 a deer perhaps \u2013 would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck. \u2018Pheromone control,\u2019 he said it was, \u2018you just have to know how to generate the right smell.\u2019 31 A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south west to the north east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice \u2013 fjords. For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers, awe struck with beauty. \u2018Arthur!\u2019 yelled Ford suddenly. It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories. \u2018Arthur!\u2019 yelled Ford again. Arthur looked to where Ford\u2019s voice had come from, carried faintly in the wind. Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. He was tense with excitement \u2013 his eyes darted up to meet Arthur\u2019s. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018look!\u2019 Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s a glacier. I\u2019ve already seen it.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018you\u2019ve looked at it, you haven\u2019t seen it. Look.\u2019 Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice. Arthur peered \u2013 he saw nothing but vague shadows. \u2018Move back from it,\u2019 insisted Ford, \u2018look again.\u2019 Arthur moved back and looked again. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, and shrugged. \u2018What am I supposed to be looking for?\u2019 And suddenly he saw it. \u2018You see it?\u2019 He saw it. His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn\u2019t got anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to the ground. The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface. Looked at from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high; and for those, like Arthur, who couldn\u2019t read Magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice. It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind. It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on. 32 A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust. The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended. The captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him. Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they hadn\u2019t yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine \u2013 perfection. To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn\u2019t found in mines, the captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged. No, life was very pleasant, and the great thing about it was that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look forward to. Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, increasing the captain\u2019s already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop. That was something he looked forward to as well. What else was pleasant? he asked himself. Well, so many things: the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock hewn bath. The only thing nicer than a phone that didn\u2019t ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones that didn\u2019t ring all the time (or indeed at all). Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting. The captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The afternoon committee meetings were his favourite. Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer skin coat; his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country rock singer\u2019s. He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for almost a week now, and Ford had decided it was time to stir things up a bit. The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford\u2019s eyes narrowed. They couldn\u2019t be interested in botany of a sudden, could they? In the middle of these speculations the captain\u2019s voice rose above the hubbub. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019d like to call this meeting to some sort of order if that\u2019s at all possible. Is that all right with everybody?\u2019 He smiled genially. \u2018In a minute. When you\u2019re all ready.\u2019 The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him. If there was any reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment. A small group of people had clustered round the captain and one of them was clearly preparing to speak. He did this by standing up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute. The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him. A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak. Ford dropped down out of the tree. \u2018Hi there,\u2019 he said. The crowd swivelled round. \u2018Ah, my dear fellow,\u2019 called out the captain. \u2018Got any matches on you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d prepared. He decided he\u2019d better be a little stronger on the subject. \u2018No I haven\u2019t,\u2019 he continued. \u2018No matches. Instead I bring you news...\u2019 \u2018Pity,\u2019 said the captain. \u2018We\u2019ve all run out, you see. Haven\u2019t had a hot bath in weeks.\u2019 Ford refused to be headed off. \u2018I bring you news,\u2019 he said, \u2018of a discovery that might interest you.\u2019 \u2018Is it on the agenda?\u2019 snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted. Ford smiled a broad country rock singer smile. \u2018Now, come on,\u2019 he said. \u2018Well I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said the man huffily, \u2018but speaking as a management consultant of many years\u2019 standing, I must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure.\u2019 Ford looked round the crowd. \u2018He\u2019s mad, you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018this is a prehistoric planet.\u2019 \u2018Address the chair!\u2019 snapped the management consultant. \u2018There isn\u2019t a chair,\u2019 explained Ford, \u2018there\u2019s only a rock.\u2019 The management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for. \u2018Well, call it a chair,\u2019 he said testily. \u2018Why not call it a rock?\u2019 asked Ford. \u2018You obviously have no conception,\u2019 said the management consultant, now abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur, \u2018of modern business methods.\u2019 \u2018And you have no conception of where you are,\u2019 said Ford. A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it. \u2018Shut up, you two,\u2019 she said, \u2018I want to table a motion.\u2019 \u2018You mean boulder a motion,\u2019 tittered a hairdresser. \u2018Order, order!\u2019 yapped the management consultant. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018let\u2019s see how you\u2019re doing.\u2019 He plonked himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper. The captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise. \u2018I would like to call to order,\u2019 he said pleasantly, \u2018the five hundred and seventy third meeting of the colonization committee of Fintlewoodlewix...\u2019 Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again. \u2018This is futile,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018five hundred and seventy three committee meetings and you haven\u2019t even discovered fire yet!\u2019 \u2018If you would care,\u2019 said the girl with the strident voice, \u2018to examine the agenda sheet...\u2019 \u2018Agenda rock,\u2019 trilled the hairdresser happily. \u2018Thank you, I\u2019ve made that point,\u2019 muttered Ford. \u2018... you... will... see...\u2019 continued the girl firmly, \u2018that we are having a report from the Hairdressers\u2019 Fire Development Sub Committee today.\u2019 \u2018Oh... ah \u2013 \u2019 said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning, \u2018Er, will next Tuesday do?\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, rounding on him, \u2018what have you done? What are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?\u2019 \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said the hairdresser. \u2018All they gave me was a couple of sticks...\u2019 \u2018So what have you done with them?\u2019 Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford. Ford held them up for all to see. \u2018Curling tongs,\u2019 he said. The crowd applauded. \u2018Never mind,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Rome wasn\u2019t burnt in a day.\u2019 The crowd hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved it nevertheless. They applauded. \u2018Well, you\u2019re obviously being totally naive, of course,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018When you\u2019ve been in marketing as long as I have you\u2019ll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched. We\u2019ve got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them.\u2019 The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful from Ford. \u2018Stick it up your nose,\u2019 he said. \u2018Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,\u2019 insisted the girl. \u2018Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?\u2019 \u2018Do you?\u2019 Ford asked the crowd. \u2018Yes!\u2019 shouted some. \u2018No!\u2019 shouted others happily. They didn\u2019t know, they just thought it was great. \u2018And the wheel,\u2019 said the captain. \u2018What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the marketing girl, \u2018well, we\u2019re having a little difficulty there.\u2019 \u2018Difficulty?\u2019 exclaimed Ford. \u2018Difficulty? What do you mean, difficulty? It\u2019s the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!\u2019 The marketing girl soured him with a look. \u2018All right, Mr Wiseguy,\u2019 she said, \u2018you\u2019re so clever, you tell us what colour it should be.\u2019 The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again. \u2018Almighty Zarquon,\u2019 he said, \u2018have none of you done anything?\u2019 As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn\u2019t believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their Golgafrinchan 3rd Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them still carried Kill O Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they marched. They looked bronzed, healthy and utterly exhausted and bedraggled. They clattered to a halt and banged to attention. One of them fell over and never moved again. \u2018Captain, sir!\u2019 cried Number Two \u2013 for he was their leader. \u2018Permission to report, sir!\u2019 \u2018Yes, all right, Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot springs?\u2019 said the captain despondently. \u2018No, sir!\u2019 \u2018Thought you wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath. \u2018We have discovered another continent!\u2019 \u2018When was this?\u2019 \u2018It lies across the sea...\u2019 said Number Two, narrowing his eyes significantly, \u2018to the east!\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd. \u2018We have declared war on it!\u2019 Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing \u2013 this was beyond all expectation. \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019 shouted Ford Prefect, \u2018wait a minute!\u2019 He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem. \u2018Do we have to have the piper?\u2019 demanded Ford. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018we\u2019ve given him a grant.\u2019 Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two. \u2018War?\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes!\u2019 Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect. \u2018On the next continent?\u2019 \u2018Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!\u2019 \u2018But there\u2019s no one even living there yet!\u2019 Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point. Number Two\u2019s gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquitoes that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or rolled newspapers. \u2018I know that,\u2019 he said, \u2018but there will be one day! So we have left an open ended ultimatum.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018And blown up a few military installations.\u2019 The captain leaned forward out of his bath. \u2018Military installations, Number Two?\u2019 he said. For a moment the eyes wavered. \u2018Yes, sir, well, potential military installations. All right... trees.\u2019 The moment of uncertainty passed \u2013 his eyes flicked like whips over his audience. \u2018And,\u2019 he roared, \u2018we interrogated a gazelle!\u2019 He flipped his Kill O Zap smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing. Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together. \u2018So what else have you done?\u2019 he enquired after the celebrations had died down. \u2018We have started a culture,\u2019 said the marketing girl. \u2018Oh yes?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area.\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re not cavemen.\u2019 \u2018They look like cavemen.\u2019 \u2018Do they live in caves?\u2019 \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018They live in huts.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps they\u2019re having their caves redecorated,\u2019 called out a wag from the crowd. Ford rounded on him angrily. \u2018Very funny,\u2019 he said, \u2018but have you noticed that they\u2019re dying out?\u2019 On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where they had crept away to die. Those that still lived seemed stricken and listless, as if they were suffering from some disease of the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them. \u2018Dying out!\u2019 repeated Ford. \u2018Do you know what that means?\u2019 \u2018Er... we shouldn\u2019t sell them any life insurance?\u2019 called out the wag again. Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd. \u2018Can you try and understand,\u2019 he said, \u2018that it\u2019s just since we\u2019ve arrived here that they\u2019ve started dying out!\u2019 \u2018In fact that comes over terribly well in this film,\u2019 said the marketing girl, \u2018and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer\u2019s very committed.\u2019 \u2018He should be,\u2019 muttered Ford. \u2018I gather,\u2019 said the girl, turning to address the captain, who was beginning to nod off, \u2018that he wants to make one about you next, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Oh really?\u2019 he said, coming to with a start. \u2018That\u2019s awfully nice.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command...\u2019 The captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment. \u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t overstress that angle, you know,\u2019 he said finally, \u2018one\u2019s never alone with a rubber duck.\u2019 He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd. All this while, the management consultant had been sitting in stony silence, his fingertips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary. At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn\u2019t happened. He rose to his feet. \u2018If,\u2019 he said tersely, \u2018we could for a moment move on to the subject of fiscal policy...\u2019 \u2018Fiscal policy!\u2019 whooped Ford Prefect. \u2018Fiscal policy!\u2019 The management consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied. \u2018Fiscal policy...\u2019 he repeated, \u2018that is what I said.\u2019 \u2018How can you have money,\u2019 demanded Ford, \u2018if none of you actually produces anything? It doesn\u2019t grow on trees, you know.\u2019 \u2018If you would allow me to continue...\u2019 Ford nodded dejectedly. \u2018Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich.\u2019 Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed. \u2018But we have also,\u2019 continued the management consultant, \u2018run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship\u2019s peanut.\u2019 Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The management consultant waved them down. \u2018So in order to obviate this problem,\u2019 he continued, \u2018and effectively revalue the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and... er, burn down all the forests. I think you\u2019ll all agree that\u2019s a sensible move under the circumstances.\u2019 The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the management consultant a standing ovation. The accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable autumn. \u2018You\u2019re all mad,\u2019 explained Ford Prefect. \u2018You\u2019re absolutely barmy,\u2019 he suggested. \u2018You\u2019re a bunch of raving nutters,\u2019 he opined. The tide of opinion was beginning to turn against him. What had started out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd\u2019s view, deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the main directed at them they wearied of it. Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him. \u2018Is it perhaps in order,\u2019 she demanded, \u2018to enquire what you\u2019ve been doing all these months, then? You and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve been on a journey,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018We went to try and find out something about this planet.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the girl archly, \u2018doesn\u2019t sound very productive to me.\u2019 \u2018No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered this planet\u2019s future.\u2019 Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn\u2019t have any. They didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. He continued. \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter a pair of fetid dingo\u2019s kidneys what you all choose to do from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it won\u2019t make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already happened. Two million years you\u2019ve got and that\u2019s it. At the end of that time your race will be dead, gone and good riddance to you. Remember that, two million years!\u2019 The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they had suddenly become shouldn\u2019t be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away. They didn\u2019t need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two, who was already firing his Kill O Zap into some neighbouring trees. He turned back once. \u2018Two million years!\u2019 he said and laughed. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the captain with a soothing smile, \u2018still time for a few more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped it over the side.\u2019 33 A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach. What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty nine smaller squares, thirteen to a side. Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men to whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones. So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he\u2019d managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence. In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves. It was not going well. Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree. \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, \u2018Q scores ten, you see, and it\u2019s on a triple word score, so... Look, I\u2019ve explained the rules to you... No, no, look, please, put down that jawbone... All right, we\u2019ll start again. And try to concentrate this time.\u2019 Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his head. \u2018What are you doing, Arthur?\u2019 he asked quietly. Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had worked like a dream on him when he was a child. But things were different then, or rather would be. \u2018I\u2019m trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re not cavemen,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018They look like cavemen.\u2019 Ford let it pass. \u2018I see,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s uphill work,\u2019 said Arthur wearily, \u2018the only word they know is grunt and they can\u2019t spell it.\u2019 He sighed and sat back. \u2018What\u2019s that supposed to achieve?\u2019 asked Ford. \u2018We\u2019ve got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!\u2019 Arthur burst out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn\u2019t. He jumped to his feet. \u2018Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those... cretins we arrived with?\u2019 he said. \u2018Imagine?\u2019 said Ford, raising his eyebrows. \u2018We don\u2019t have to imagine. We\u2019ve seen it.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly. \u2018We\u2019ve seen it,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018there\u2019s no escape.\u2019 Arthur kicked at a stone. \u2018Did you tell them what we\u2019d discovered?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Hmmmm?\u2019 said Ford, not really concentrating. \u2018Norway,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Slartibartfast\u2019s signature in the glacier. Did you tell them?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the point?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What would it mean to them?\u2019 \u2018Mean?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Mean? You know perfectly well what it means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It\u2019s my home! It\u2019s where I was born!\u2019 \u2018Was?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018All right, will be.\u2019 \u2018Yes, in two million years\u2019 time. Why don\u2019t you tell them that? Go and say to them, \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019d just like to point out that in two million years\u2019 time I will be born just a few miles from here.\u201d See what they say. They\u2019ll chase you up a tree and set fire to it.\u2019 Arthur absorbed this unhappily. \u2018Face it,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not these poor creatures here.\u2019 He went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head. \u2018Put the Scrabble away, Arthur,\u2019 he said, \u2018it won\u2019t save the human race, because this lot aren\u2019t going to be the human race. The human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other side of this hill making documentaries about themselves.\u2019 Arthur winced. \u2018There must be something we can do,\u2019 he said. A terrible sense of desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here, on the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past as well. \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018there\u2019s nothing we can do. This doesn\u2019t change the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you are descended from. In two million years they get destroyed by the Vogons. History is never altered, you see, it just fits together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant privet bush where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and didn\u2019t stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which subsequently washed it away. During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel officer on Golgafrinchan, and he was terribly upset when she suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never throw the letter Q into a privet bush, but unfortunately there are times when it is unavoidable. Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of events was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. They were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing the other letters around. \u2018Poor bloody caveman,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018They\u2019re not...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Oh, never mind,\u2019 said Ford. The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged on the rock. \u2018It\u2019s all been a bit of a waste of time for them, hasn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Uh uh urghhhhh,\u2019 muttered the native and banged on the rock again. \u2018They\u2019ve been out evolved by telephone sanitizers.\u2019 \u2018Urgh, grr grr, gruh!\u2019 insisted the native, continuing to bang on the rock. \u2018Why does he keep banging on the rock?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018he\u2019s pointing to the letters.\u2019 \u2018Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on telling him there\u2019s only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc.\u2019 The native banged on the rock again. They looked over his shoulder. Their eyes popped. There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid out in a clear straight line. They spelt two words. The words were these: \u2018FORTY TWO.\u2019 \u2018Grrrurgh guh guh,\u2019 explained the native. He swept the letters angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his colleague. Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other. \u2018Did that say what I thought it said?\u2019 they both said to each other. \u2018Yes,\u2019 they both said. \u2018Forty two,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Forty two,\u2019 said Ford. Arthur ran over to the two natives. \u2018What are you trying to tell us?\u2019 he shouted. \u2018What\u2019s it supposed to mean?\u2019 One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the air, rolled over again and went to sleep. The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said it. \u2018You know what this means,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Not entirely.\u2019 \u2018Forty two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate Answer.\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer.\u2019 \u2018So we are led to believe.\u2019 \u2018And organic life was part of the computer matrix.\u2019 \u2018If you say so.\u2019 \u2018I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen, are an integral part of the computer program, and that we and the Golgafrinchans are not.\u2019 \u2018But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are obviously set to replace them.\u2019 \u2018Exactly. So you do see what this means.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Cock up,\u2019 said Ford Prefect. Arthur looked around him. \u2018This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it,\u2019 he said. Ford puzzled for a moment. \u2018Still, something must have come out of it,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your brain wave patterns.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It might give us a clue, though, if we could find it. I don\u2019t see how we can, though.\u2019 They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn\u2019t an occupation he could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn\u2019t grass he could believe in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to be crawled through. Ford fiddled with his Sub Etha Sens O Matic. It was silent. He sighed and put it away. Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home made Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and put it down again. The letter he put it down next to was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed another couple of letters next to them. They were an S and an H, as it happened. By a curious coincidence the resulting word perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just then. He stared at it for a moment. He hadn\u2019t done it deliberately, it was just a random chance. His brain got slowly into first gear. \u2018Ford,\u2019 he said suddenly, \u2018look, if that Question is printed in my brain wave patterns but I\u2019m not consciously aware of it it must be somewhere in my unconscious.\u2019 \u2018Yes, I suppose so.\u2019 \u2018There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern forward.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes?\u2019 \u2018Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by that pattern.\u2019 \u2018Like how?\u2019 \u2018Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfold.\u2019 Ford leapt to his feet. \u2018Brilliant!\u2019 he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag. \u2018Totally mad,\u2019 he said, \u2018utter nonsense. But we\u2019ll do it because it\u2019s brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on.\u2019 The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad raindrops fell. They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them into the bag. They shook them up. \u2018Right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on, come on, come on.\u2019 Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them. \u2018W,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018H, A, T... What!\u2019 He blinked. \u2018I think it\u2019s working!\u2019 he said. Arthur pushed three more at him. \u2018D, O, Y,... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn\u2019t working,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Here\u2019s the next three.\u2019 \u2018O, U, G... Doyoug... It\u2019s not making sense, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place. \u2018E, T, doyouget... Do you get!\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018It is working! This is amazing, it really is working!\u2019 \u2018More here.\u2019 Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as he could go. \u2018I, F,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018Y, O, U,... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y,... What do you get if you multiply,... S, I, X,... six,... B, Y, by, six by... what do you get if you multiply six by... N, I, N, E,... six by nine...\u2019 He paused. \u2018Come on, where\u2019s the next one?\u2019 \u2018Er, that\u2019s the lot,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that\u2019s all there were.\u2019 He sat back, nonplussed. He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no more letters. \u2018You mean that\u2019s it?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019 \u2018Six by nine. Forty two.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all there is.\u2019 34 The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter. \u2018No, don\u2019t go,\u2019 called Ford Prefect between gasps, \u2018we\u2019ll be with you in just a moment.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 asked one of the girls. She was the taller and slimmer of the two. On Golgafrinchan she had been a junior personnel officer, but hadn\u2019t liked it much. Ford pulled himself together. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hello. My friend and I were just contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise.\u2019 \u2018Oh, it\u2019s you,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018You made a bit of a spectacle of yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but you did bang on a bit.\u2019 \u2018Did I? Oh yes.\u2019 \u2018Yes, what was all that for?\u2019 asked the other girl, a shorter round faced girl who had been an art director for a small advertising company on Golgafrinchan. Whatever the privations of this world were, she went to sleep every night profoundly grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the morning it wouldn\u2019t be a hundred almost identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. \u2018For? For nothing. Nothing\u2019s for anything,\u2019 said Ford Prefect happily. \u2018Come and join us, I\u2019m Ford, this is Arthur. We were just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait.\u2019 The girls looked at them doubtfully. \u2018I\u2019m Agda,\u2019 said the tall one, \u2018this is Mella.\u2019 \u2018Hello, Agda, hello, Mella,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Do you talk at all?\u2019 said Mella to Arthur. \u2018Oh, eventually,\u2019 said Arthur with a smile, \u2018but not as much as Ford.\u2019 \u2018Good.\u2019 There was a slight pause. \u2018What did you mean,\u2019 asked Agda, \u2018about only having two million years? I couldn\u2019t make sense of what you were saying.\u2019 \u2018Oh that,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just that the world gets demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass,\u2019 said Arthur with a shrug, \u2018but that\u2019s two million years away, and anyway it\u2019s just Vogons doing what Vogons do.\u2019 \u2018Vogons?\u2019 said Mella. \u2018Yes, you wouldn\u2019t know them.\u2019 \u2018Where\u2019d you get this idea from?\u2019 \u2018It really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just like a dream from the past, or the future.\u2019 Arthur smiled and looked away. \u2018Does it worry you that you don\u2019t talk any kind of sense?\u2019 asked Agda. \u2018Listen, forget it,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018forget all of it. Nothing matters. Look, it\u2019s a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees.\u2019 \u2018Even if it\u2019s only a dream, it\u2019s a pretty horrible idea,\u2019 said Mella, \u2018destroying a world just to make a bypass.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve heard of worse,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I read of one planet off in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black hole. Killed ten billion people.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s mad,\u2019 said Mella. \u2018Yes, only scored thirty points too.\u2019 Agda and Mella exchanged glances. \u2018Look,\u2019 said Agda, \u2018there\u2019s a party after the committee meeting tonight. You can come along if you like.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, OK,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I\u2019d like to,\u2019 said Arthur. Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise over the dull red glow of the trees. \u2018That story about the world being destroyed...\u2019 began Mella. \u2018In two million years, yes.\u2019 \u2018You say it as if you really think it\u2019s true.\u2019 \u2018Yes, I think it is. I think I was there.\u2019 She shook her head in puzzlement. \u2018You\u2019re very strange,\u2019 she said. \u2018No, I\u2019m very ordinary,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018but some very strange things have happened to me. You could say I\u2019m more differed from than differing.\u2019 \u2018And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got pushed into a black hole.\u2019 \u2018Ah, that I don\u2019t know about. It sounds like something from the book.\u2019 \u2018What book?\u2019 Arthur paused. \u2018The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be wanting it any more,\u2019 said Arthur Dent. Enclosed here are samples of original material sourced from the Pan Macmillan Douglas Adams archives Note from Douglas Adams Press release for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe Would you like to continue reading about Arthur Dent and his many adventures across time and space? If so, pick up the story in the next part of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series. An extract follows here from 1 The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was. It wasn\u2019t just that the cave was cold, it wasn\u2019t just that it was damp and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington and there wasn\u2019t a bus due for two million years. Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy. He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he had ever dreamt existed, and though life had now turned very, very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy. He hadn\u2019t been blown up now for five years. Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had parted company four years previously, he hadn\u2019t been insulted in all that time either. Except just once. It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously. He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He turned and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart. Rescue. Escape. The cast away\u2019s impossible dream \u2013 a ship. And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm. A ramp extended itself. Light streamed out. A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. \u2018You\u2019re a jerk, Dent,\u2019 it said simply. It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly draped golden robes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale grey green alien skin which had about it that lustrous sheen which most grey green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap. Arthur boggled at it. It gazed levelly at him. Arthur\u2019s first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal cords at this moment. \u2018Whh... ?\u2019 he said. \u2018Bu... hu... uh...\u2019 he added. \u2018Ru... ra... wah... who?\u2019 he managed finally to say and lapsed into a frantic kind of silence. He was feeling the effects of having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could remember. The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand. \u2018Arthur Dent?\u2019 it said. Arthur nodded helplessly. \u2018Arthur Philip Dent?\u2019 pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. \u2018Er... er... yes... er... er,\u2019 confirmed Arthur. \u2018You\u2019re a jerk,\u2019 repeated the alien, \u2018a complete asshole.\u2019 \u2018Er...\u2019 The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards its ship. \u2018Er...\u2019 said Arthur desperately, \u2018er...\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t give me that,\u2019 snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, through the hatchway and disappeared into its ship. The ship sealed itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum. \u2018Er, hey!\u2019 shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it. \u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 he called. \u2018What is this? What? Wait a minute!\u2019 The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the evening sky. It passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance. \u2018What?\u2019 he screamed. \u2018What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and say that!\u2019 He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to hear him or speak to him. The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each other. Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged. He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose, as he would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose and it did at least keep him on the move. Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was \u2013 indeed, is \u2013 one of the Universe\u2019s very small number of immortal beings. Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality inadvertently thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands. The precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying. Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz on the ship\u2019s stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn\u2019t been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have done. To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, cleaning up on high yield long term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody. In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn\u2019t cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you know that you\u2019ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o\u2019clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul. So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear at other people\u2019s funerals began to fade. He began to despise the Universe in general and everybody in it in particular. This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on for ever. It was this. He would insult the Universe. That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order. When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, \u2018A man can dream, can\u2019t he?\u2019 And so he had started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to last with a computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved. His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space. \u2018Computer,\u2019 he said. \u2018Here,\u2019 yipped the computer. \u2018Where next?\u2019 \u2018Computing that.\u2019 Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary. Most of them he would be going to millions of times over. He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a child\u2019s numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very very rude word. The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations. \u2018Folfanga,\u2019 it said. It beeped. \u2018Fourth world of the Folfanga system,\u2019 it continued. It beeped again. \u2018Estimated journey time, three weeks,\u2019 it continued further. It beeped again. \u2018There to meet with a small slug,\u2019 it beeped, \u2018of the genus A Rth Urp Hil Ipdenu.\u2019 \u2018I believe,\u2019 it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, \u2018that you had decided to call it a brainless prat.\u2019 Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two. \u2018I think I\u2019ll take a nap,\u2019 he said, and then added, \u2018What network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?\u2019 The computer beeped. \u2018Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box,\u2019 it said, and beeped. \u2018Any movies I haven\u2019t seen thirty thousand times already?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Uh.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s Angst in Space. You\u2019ve only seen that thirty three thousand five hundred and seventeen times.\u2019 \u2018Wake me for the second reel.\u2019 The computor beeped. \u2018Sleep well,\u2019 it said. The ship fled on through the night. Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening. The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in. 2 This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave. Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning. The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could. It wasn\u2019t all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad. He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision. He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair. He spread his arms out wide. \u2018I will go mad!\u2019 he announced. \u2018Good idea,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting. Arthur\u2019s brain somersaulted. His jaw did press ups. \u2018I went mad for a while,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018did me no end of good.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s eyes did cartwheels. \u2018You see,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018\u2013...\u2019 \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 interrupted Arthur, now that his head had finished working out. \u2018Around,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018around and about.\u2019 He grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. \u2018I just took my mind off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back. It did.\u2019 He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his Sub Etha Sens O Matic. \u2018At least,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think it did. This has been playing up a bit.\u2019 He shook it. \u2018If it was a false alarm I shall go mad,\u2019 he said, \u2018again.\u2019 Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up. \u2018I thought you must be dead...\u2019 he said simply. \u2018So did I for a while,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018and then I decided I was a lemon for a couple of weeks. I kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic.\u2019 Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again. \u2018Where,\u2019 he said, \u2018did you... ?\u2019 \u2018Find a gin and tonic?\u2019 said Ford brightly. \u2018I found a small lake that thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic. \u2018I may,\u2019 he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering into trees, \u2018have been imagining it.\u2019 He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that. \u2018Carry on,\u2019 he said evenly. \u2018The point is, you see,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later.\u2019 \u2018And this is you sane again, is it?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I ask merely for information.\u2019 \u2018I went to Africa,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018What was that like?\u2019 \u2018And this is your cave, is it?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Er, yes,\u2019 said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person. \u2018Very nice,\u2019 said Ford, in reference to Arthur\u2019s cave. \u2018You must hate it.\u2019 Arthur didn\u2019t bother to reply. \u2018Africa was very interesting,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I behaved very oddly there.\u2019 He gazed thoughtfully into the distance. \u2018I took up being cruel to animals,\u2019 he said airily. \u2018But only,\u2019 he added, \u2018as a hobby.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, warily. \u2018Yes,\u2019 Ford assured him. \u2018I won\u2019t disturb you with the details because they would\u2014\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried to learn to fly. Do you believe me?\u2019 \u2018Tell me,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you later. I\u2019ll just mention that the Guide says...\u2019 \u2018The...?\u2019 \u2018Guide. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?\u2019 \u2018Yes. I remember throwing it in the river.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but I fished it out.\u2019 \u2018You didn\u2019t tell me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t want you to throw it in again.\u2019 \u2018Fair enough,\u2019 admitted Arthur. \u2018It says?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018The Guide says?\u2019 \u2018The Guide says that there is an art to flying,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\u2019 He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn through. \u2018I haven\u2019t done very well so far,\u2019 he said. He stuck out his hand. \u2018I\u2019m very glad to see you again, Arthur,\u2019 he added. Arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and bewilderment. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen anyone for years,\u2019 he said, \u2018not anyone. I can hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I practise, you see. I practise by talking to... talking to... what are those things people think you\u2019re mad if you talk to? Like George the Third.\u2019 \u2018Kings?\u2019 suggested Ford. \u2018No, no,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The things he used to talk to. We\u2019re surrounded by them, for Heaven\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve planted hundreds myself. They all died. Trees! I practise by talking to trees. What\u2019s that for?\u2019 Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with incomprehension. \u2018Shake,\u2019 prompted Ford. Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a fish. Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming flood of relief. He shook it and shook it. After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed to the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them. \u2018What happened to the Golgafrinchans?\u2019 asked Ford. Arthur shrugged. \u2018A lot of them didn\u2019t make it through the winter three years ago,\u2019 he said, \u2018and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set off on a raft. History says that they must have survived...\u2019 \u2018Huh,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018well well.\u2019 He stuck his hands on his hips and looked round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about Ford a sense of energy and purpose. \u2018We\u2019re going,\u2019 he said excitedly, and shivered with energy. \u2018Where? How?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but I just feel that the time is right. Things are going to happen. We\u2019re on our way.\u2019 He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u2018I have detected,\u2019 he said, \u2018disturbances in the wash.\u2019 He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off. Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he hadn\u2019t quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it. \u2018The wash?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The space\u2013time wash,\u2019 said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly past at that moment, he bared his teeth into it. Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat. \u2018Are we talking about,\u2019 he asked cautiously, \u2018some sort of Vogon laundromat, or what are we talking about?\u2019 \u2018Eddies,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018in the space\u2013time continuum.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 nodded Arthur, \u2018is he? Is he?\u2019 He pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance. \u2018What?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Er, who,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018is Eddy, then, exactly, then?\u2019 Ford looked angrily at him. \u2018Will you listen?\u2019 he snapped. \u2018I have been listening,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s helped.\u2019 Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone company accounts department. \u2018There seem...\u2019 he said, \u2018to be some pools...\u2019 he said, \u2018of instability...\u2019 he said, \u2018in the fabric...\u2019 he said... Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the foolish look into a foolish remark. \u2018... in the fabric of space\u2013time,\u2019 he said. \u2018Ah, that,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Yes, that,\u2019 confirmed Ford. They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and stared each other resolutely in the face. \u2018And it\u2019s done what?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018It,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018has developed pools of instability.\u2019 \u2018Has it?\u2019 said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment. \u2018It has,\u2019 said Ford with a similar degree of occular immobility. \u2018Good,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018See?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur. There was a quiet pause. \u2018The difficulty with this conversation,\u2019 said Arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, \u2018is that it\u2019s very different from most of the ones I\u2019ve had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees. They weren\u2019t like this. Except perhaps some of the ones I\u2019ve had with elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down.\u2019 \u2018Arthur,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Hello? Yes?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very very simple.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well I\u2019m not sure I believe that.\u2019 They sat down and composed their thoughts. Ford got out his Sub Etha Sens O Matic. It was making vague humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly. \u2018Flat battery?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of space\u2013time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it\u2019s somewhere in our vicinity.\u2019 \u2018Where?\u2019 Ford moved the device in a slow, lightly bobbing semi circle. Suddenly the light flashed. \u2018There!\u2019 said Ford, shooting out his arm. \u2018There, behind that sofa!\u2019 Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He boggled intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his mind. \u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018is there a sofa in that field?\u2019 \u2018I told you!\u2019 shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. \u2018Eddies in the space\u2013time continuum!\u2019 \u2018And this is his sofa, is it?\u2019 asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses. \u2018Arthur!\u2019 shouted Ford at him. \u2018That sofa is there because of the space\u2013time instability I\u2019ve been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with. It\u2019s been washed up out of the continuum, it\u2019s space\u2013 time jetsam, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, we\u2019ve got to catch it, it\u2019s our only way out of here!\u2019 He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field. \u2018Catch it?\u2019 muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass. With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture. They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way. The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake. Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others. Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and spun, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it. With a heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, St John\u2019s Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the Australian Series in the year 198\u2014, with England needing only twenty eight runs to win.

        "To Jane and James with many thanks To Geoffrey Perkins for achieving the Improbable To Paddy Kingsland, Lisa Braun and Alick Hale Munro for helping him To Simon Brett for starting the whole thing off To the Paul Simon album One Trick Pony which I played incessantly while writing this book Five years is far too long And with very special thanks to Jacqui Graham for infinite patience, kindness and food in adversity Contents Foreword Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3 Chapter 4 Chapter 5 Chapter 6 Chapter 7 Chapter 8 Chapter 9 Chapter 10 Chapter 11 Chapter 12 Chapter 13 Chapter 14 Chapter 15 Chapter 16 Chapter 17 Chapter 18 Chapter 19 Chapter 20 Chapter 21 Chapter 22 Chapter 23 Chapter 24 Chapter 25 Chapter 26 Chapter 27 Chapter 28 Chapter 29 Chapter 30 Chapter 31 Chapter 32 Chapter 33 Chapter 34 Foreword by Terry Jones I woke up one Sunday morning with a hangover and remembered that I\u2019d bought two tickets for a five hour silent film (it was the first performance of Abel Gance\u2019s Napol\u00e9on).",
        "My wife also had a hangover and said she couldn\u2019t face it, so I rang Mike Palin and he said he had a hangover and couldn\u2019t face it.",
        "So then I rang Douglas Adams and he said he had a hangover and couldn\u2019t face it.",
        "So I prepared to sit for five hours on my own, watching a film I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to see.",
        "However, just as I was opening the front door to leave the house, the phone rang and it was Douglas, who said, \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and it seems such a terrible idea that I think I ought to do it.\u2019 Douglas wasn\u2019t afraid of ideas even if they seemed like bad ones.",
        "Indeed he was totally obsessed with the idea of ideas.",
        "Nobody, I suspect, reads the Hitchhiker books for their plot.",
        "Not many, I would suppose, read them for their characters (apart from Marvin).",
        "So why is it that we love these books so much? After all, if a novel doesn\u2019t have great characters or a compelling plot, why bother reading it? In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, there is an interlude in which the Ruler of the Universe talks to his cat about how we know we know anything or how we know what we perceive is what we are actually perceiving or is what is happening, and he concludes by saying, \u2018Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky.",
        "Yes, that seems more likely.\u2019 And he pours himself a glass of whisky.",
        "It\u2019s one of those magical moments when Douglas\u2019s fascination with ideas comes to the fore.",
        "And it\u2019s those magical moments that I love in Douglas\u2019s writing.",
        "He\u2019s the only novelist I know who can make ideas a page turner.",
        "And The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is full of ideas.",
        "And humour.",
        "That\u2019s the other thing Douglas was so good at: making ideas not only interesting but funny.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy opines that every civilization goes through three stages: Survival, Enquiry and Sophistication \u2013 the how?, why? and where? stages.",
        "The Guide says: \u2018the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?\u2019 Then there is the wonderful concept of the A, B and C spaceships, in which all the people in Management, Accountancy, Advertising and Hairdressing are sent off in advance while the creative and productive people stay behind and somehow never make it into space...",
        "deliberately.",
        "When you look nowadays at the BBC or the National Health Service, you get the feeling that we all must have been on the B Ark.",
        "In fact, The Restaurant is full of slightly prophetic elements.",
        "The one that makes me shudder, at the edge of today\u2019s economic disaster, is the section where the settlers from the B Ark have made the leaf into legal tender \u2013 so money really does grow on trees.",
        "But they now realize that there is too much currency available and so, to remedy the situation in fiscal terms, they decide to burn down all the forests.",
        "So welcome to Douglas Adams\u2019s Rollercoaster of Ideas.",
        "Oh, and we had a great day at Abel Gance\u2019s Napol\u00e9on.",
        "It wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all.",
        "TERRY JONES Python and co author of Starship Titanic There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.",
        "There is another theory which states that this has already happened.",
        "1 The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created.",
        "This had made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.",
        "Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle Six believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.",
        "The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.",
        "However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle Six and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought.",
        "For instance, a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.",
        "For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty two \u2013 and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was.",
        "And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet \u2013 especially by the strange ape like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.",
        "And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense.",
        "Sadly, however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way \u2013 so they claimed \u2013 for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.",
        "Or so it would seem.",
        "Two of these strange, ape like creatures survived.",
        "Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers.",
        "Tricia McMillan \u2013 or Trillian \u2013 had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy.",
        "Two survivors.",
        "They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted \u2013 to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything.",
        "And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them.",
        "2 Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed.",
        "The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protruded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible.",
        "Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses.",
        "In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside it and look at a Vogon.",
        "If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born \u2013 or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born.",
        "In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn\u2019t even think once.",
        "They are simple minded, thick willed, slug brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for.",
        "Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver.",
        "The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry.",
        "One thing they don\u2019t like is leaving a job unfinished \u2013 particularly this Vogon, and particularly \u2013 for various reasons \u2013 this job.",
        "This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he it was who had had the job of demolishing the so called \u2018planet\u2019 Earth.",
        "He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned.",
        "It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built.",
        "Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well.",
        "It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested.",
        "He had other fish to fry.",
        "It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case.",
        "When he heard the words \u2018integrity\u2019 or \u2018moral rectitude\u2019 he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away.",
        "In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty.",
        "There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over.",
        "He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.",
        "\u2018Computer,\u2019 he croaked, \u2018get me my brain care specialist on the line.\u2019 Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon face he was looking at.",
        "Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too.",
        "Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as \u2018my private brain care specialist\u2019 there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon.",
        "He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work.",
        "As one of the Galaxy\u2019s most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?\u2019 The Vogon Captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.",
        "Halfrunt\u2019s smile did not flicker for an instant.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 rumbled the Vogon, \u2018is what you always say.\u2019 \u2018Well again,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist.",
        "Good.",
        "We are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today.",
        "Now tell me, what news of the mission?\u2019 \u2018We have located the ship.\u2019 \u2018Wonderful,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018wonderful! And the occupants?\u2019 \u2018The Earthman is there.\u2019 \u2018Excellent! And...?\u2019 \u2018A female from the same planet.",
        "They are the last.\u2019 \u2018Good, good,\u2019 beamed Halfrunt.",
        "\u2018Who else?\u2019 \u2018The man Prefect.\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018And Zaphod Beeblebrox.\u2019 For an instant Halfrunt\u2019s smile flickered.",
        "\u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I had been expecting this.",
        "It is most regrettable.\u2019 \u2018A personal friend?\u2019 enquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out.",
        "\u2018Ah, no,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018in my profession, you know, we do not make personal friends.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 grunted the Vogon, \u2018professional detachment.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Halfrunt cheerfully \u2018we just don\u2019t have the knack.\u2019 He paused.",
        "His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly.",
        "\u2018But Beeblebrox, you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018he is one of my most profitable clients.",
        "He has personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts.\u2019 He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it.",
        "\u2018Still,\u2019 he said, \u2018you are ready for your task?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Good.",
        "Destroy the ship immediately.\u2019 \u2018What about Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Halfrunt brightly, \u2018Zaphod\u2019s just this guy, you know?\u2019 He vanished from the screen.",
        "The Vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew.",
        "\u2018Attack,\u2019 he said.",
        "At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly.",
        "Two hours ago, he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship\u2019s computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the Improbability factors with a pencil.",
        "The Heart of Gold\u2019s Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence.",
        "There was nothing it couldn\u2019t do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.",
        "He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it.",
        "He didn\u2019t know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it.",
        "He didn\u2019t know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be.",
        "He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.",
        "He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.",
        "At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time.",
        "He had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.",
        "\u2018Starpox!\u2019 he shouted.",
        "At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air.",
        "This was not because of anything wrong with the ship\u2019s artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stairwell which led to the ship\u2019s personal cabins.",
        "It was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod\u2019s door and explained what was on his mind.",
        "\u2018Vogons,\u2019 he said.",
        "A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea.",
        "It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism, because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation.",
        "It was called a Nutri Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before.",
        "It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it.",
        "When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid which was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
        "He attempted to reason with the thing.",
        "\u2018Tea,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Share and Enjoy,\u2019 the machine repeated and produced another one.",
        "\u2018Share and Enjoy\u2019 is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years.",
        "The motto stands \u2013 or rather stood \u2013 in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadraz.",
        "Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives \u2013 now deceased.",
        "The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read \u2018Go stick your head in a pig\u2019, and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.",
        "Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.",
        "\u2018Listen, you machine,\u2019 he said, \u2018you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?\u2019 \u2018Nutrition and pleasurable sense data,\u2019 burbled the machine.",
        "\u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018It tastes filthy!\u2019 \u2018If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink,\u2019 continued the machine, \u2018why not share it with your friends?\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 said Arthur tartly, \u2018I want to keep them.",
        "Will you try to comprehend what I\u2019m telling you? That drink...\u2019 \u2018That drink,\u2019 said the machine sweetly, \u2018was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018so I\u2019m a masochist on a diet, am I?\u2019 \u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up.\u2019 \u2018Will that be all?\u2019 Arthur decided to give up.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said.",
        "Then he decided he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d give up.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018look, it\u2019s very, very simple...",
        "all I want...",
        "is a cup of tea.",
        "You are going to make one for me.",
        "Keep quiet and listen.\u2019 And he sat.",
        "He told the Nutri Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon.",
        "He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun.",
        "He told it about silver teapots.",
        "He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn.",
        "He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn\u2019t get scalded.",
        "He even told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.",
        "\u2018So that\u2019s it, is it?\u2019 said the Nutri Matic when he had finished.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that is what I want.\u2019 \u2018You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?\u2019 \u2018Er, yes.",
        "With milk.\u2019 \u2018Squirted out of a cow?\u2019 \u2018Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to need some help with this one,\u2019 said the machine tersely.",
        "All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business.",
        "\u2018Well, anything I can do,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ve done quite enough,\u2019 the Nutri Matic informed him.",
        "It summoned up the ship\u2019s computer.",
        "\u2018Hi there!\u2019 said the ship\u2019s computer.",
        "The Nutri Matic explained about tea to the ship\u2019s computer.",
        "The computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri Matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence.",
        "Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened.",
        "He thumped it, but still nothing happened.",
        "Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.",
        "In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still.",
        "Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy.",
        "Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.",
        "3 \u2018Does anyone have a kettle?\u2019 Arthur asked as he walked on to the bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the vision screen.",
        "He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to them.",
        "\u2018Hello?\u2019 he said.",
        "At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble surface that contained the instruments that controlled the conventional photon drive.",
        "They materialized beneath his hands and he flipped over to manual control.",
        "He pushed, he pulled, he pressed and he swore.",
        "The photon drive gave a sickly judder and cut out again.",
        "\u2018Something up?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Hey, didja hear that,\u2019 muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the manual controls on the Infinite Improbability Drive, \u2018the monkey spoke!\u2019 The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut out.",
        "\u2018Pure history, man,\u2019 said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability Drive, \u2018a talking monkey!\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019re upset about something...\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Vogons!\u2019 snapped Ford.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re under attack!\u2019 Arthur gibbered.",
        "\u2018Well what are you doing? Let\u2019s get out of here!\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t.",
        "Computer\u2019s jammed.\u2019 \u2018Jammed?\u2019 \u2018It says all its circuits are occupied.",
        "There\u2019s no power anywhere in the ship.\u2019 Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across his forehead and slumped back against the wall.",
        "\u2018Nothing we can do,\u2019 he said.",
        "He glared at nothing and bit his lip.",
        "When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had been demolished, he had used to play football.",
        "He had not been at all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring own goals in important matches.",
        "Whenever this happened he used to experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow.",
        "The image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.",
        "A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow.",
        "He started to speak, and stopped.",
        "He started to speak again and stopped again.",
        "Finally he managed to speak.",
        "\u2018Er,\u2019 he said.",
        "He cleared his throat.",
        "\u2018Tell me,\u2019 he continued, and said it so nervously that the others all turned to stare at him.",
        "He glanced at the approaching yellow blob on the vision screen.",
        "\u2018Tell me,\u2019 he said again, \u2018did the computer say what was occupying it? I just ask out of interest...\u2019 Their eyes were riveted on him.",
        "\u2018And, er...",
        "well that\u2019s it really, just asking.\u2019 Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck.",
        "\u2018What have you done to it, Monkeyman?\u2019 he breathed.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018nothing in fact.",
        "It\u2019s just that I think a short while ago it was trying to work out how to...\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Make me some tea.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s right, guys,\u2019 the computer sang out suddenly, \u2018just coping with that problem right now, and wow, it\u2019s a biggy.",
        "Be with you in a while.\u2019 It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at Arthur Dent.",
        "As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to start firing.",
        "The ship shook, the ship thundered.",
        "Outside, the inch thick force shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the barrage of a dozen 30 Megahurt Definit Kil Photrazon Cannon, and looked as if it wouldn\u2019t be around for long.",
        "Four minutes is how long Ford Prefect gave it.",
        "\u2018Three minutes and fifty seconds,\u2019 he said a short while later.",
        "\u2018Forty five seconds,\u2019 he added at the appropriate time.",
        "He flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an unfriendly look.",
        "\u2018Dying for a cup of tea, eh?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Three minutes and forty seconds.\u2019 \u2018Will you stop counting!\u2019 snarled Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, \u2018in three minutes and thirty five seconds.\u2019 Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled.",
        "He had expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with tractor beams, he had expected to have to use the specially installed Sub Cyclic Normality Assert i Tron to counter the Heart of Gold\u2019s Infinite Improbability Drive; but the Sub Cyclic Normality Assert i Tron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat there and took it.",
        "A dozen 30 Megahurt Definit Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and took it.",
        "He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found.",
        "He didn\u2019t know about the tea, of course.",
        "Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life they had left to spend.",
        "Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.",
        "Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be avoided than harped upon.",
        "Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and, what\u2019s more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion.",
        "Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the Galaxy.",
        "\u2018You want to talk to your great grandfather?\u2019 boggled Ford.",
        "\u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Does it have to be now?\u2019 The ship continued to shake and thunder.",
        "The temperature was rising.",
        "The light was getting dimmer \u2013 all the energy the computer didn\u2019t require for thinking about tea was being pumped into the rapidly fading force field.",
        "\u2018Yeah!\u2019 insisted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Listen, Ford, I think he may be able to help us.\u2019 \u2018Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care.\u2019 \u2018Suggest something else we can do.\u2019 \u2018Er, well...\u2019 \u2018OK, round the central console.",
        "Come on! Trillian, Monkeyman, move.\u2019 They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands.",
        "With his third hand Zaphod turned off the lights.",
        "Darkness grabbed the ship.",
        "Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit Kil cannon continued to rip at the force field.",
        "\u2018Concentrate,\u2019 hissed Zaphod, \u2018on his name.\u2019 \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked Arthur.",
        "\u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Concentrate!\u2019 \u2018The Fourth?\u2019 \u2018Yeah.",
        "Listen, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine.",
        "Now concentrate!\u2019 \u2018Three minutes,\u2019 said Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018Why,\u2019 said Arthur Dent, \u2018are we doing this?\u2019 \u2018Shut up,\u2019 suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
        "Trillian said nothing.",
        "What, she thought, was there to say? The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped, ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather unpleasant world of his own.",
        "Round the central console four figures hunched in tight concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through it.",
        "They concentrated.",
        "Still they concentrated.",
        "And still they concentrated.",
        "The seconds ticked by.",
        "On Zaphod\u2019s brows stood beads of sweat, first of concentration, then of frustration and finally of embarrassment.",
        "At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch.",
        "\u2018Ah, I was beginning to think you\u2019d never turn the lights on,\u2019 said a voice.",
        "\u2018No, not too bright please, my eyes aren\u2019t what they once were.\u2019 Four figures jolted upright in their seats.",
        "Slowly they turned their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct propensity to try and stay in the same place.",
        "\u2018Now.",
        "Who disturbs me at this time?\u2019 said the small, bent, gaunt figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the bridge.",
        "His two small wispy haired heads looked so ancient that it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the galaxies themselves.",
        "One lolled in sleep, the other squinted sharply at them.",
        "If his eyes weren\u2019t what they once were, they must once have been diamond cutters.",
        "Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment.",
        "He gave the intricate little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture of familiar respect.",
        "\u2018Oh...",
        "er, hi, Great grandad...\u2019 he breathed.",
        "The little old figure moved closer towards them.",
        "He peered through the dim light.",
        "He thrust out a bony finger at his great grandson.",
        "\u2018Ah,\u2019 he snapped, \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
        "The last of our great line.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth.\u2019 \u2018The First.\u2019 \u2018The Nothingth,\u2019 spat the figure.",
        "Zaphod hated his voice.",
        "It always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul.",
        "He shifted awkwardly in his seat.",
        "\u2018Er, yeah,\u2019 he muttered.",
        "\u2018Er, look, I\u2019m really sorry about the flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was fresh out of wreaths and...\u2019 \u2018You forgot!\u2019 snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.",
        "\u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018Too busy.",
        "Never think of other people.",
        "The living are all the same.\u2019 \u2018Two minutes, Zaphod,\u2019 whispered Ford in an awed whisper.",
        "Zaphod fidgeted nervously.",
        "\u2018Yeah, but I did mean to send them,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018And I\u2019ll write to my great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this...\u2019 \u2018Your great grandmother,\u2019 mused the gaunt little figure to himself.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Er, how is she? Tell you what, I\u2019ll go and see her.",
        "But first we\u2019ve just got to...\u2019 \u2018Your late great grandmother and I are very well,\u2019 rasped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.",
        "Oh.\u2019 \u2018But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well...\u2019 Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of this conversation, and Ford\u2019s heavy breathing at his side told him that the seconds were ticking away fast.",
        "The noise and the shaking had reached terrifying proportions.",
        "He saw Trillian and Arthur\u2019s faces white and unblinking in the gloom.",
        "\u2018Er, Great grandfather...\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve been following your progress with considerable despondency...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, look, just at the moment, you see...\u2019 \u2018Not to say contempt!\u2019 \u2018Could you sort of listen for a moment...\u2019 \u2018I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m being attacked by a Vogon fleet!\u2019 cried Zaphod.",
        "It was an exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting the basic point of the exercise across.",
        "\u2018Doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least,\u2019 said the little old figure with a shrug.",
        "\u2018Only it\u2019s happening right now, you see,\u2019 insisted Zaphod feverishly.",
        "The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had brought in and looked at it with interest.",
        "\u2018Er...",
        "Great grandad...\u2019 \u2018Did you know,\u2019 interrupted the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod with a stern look, \u2018that Betelgeuse Five has now developed a very slight eccentricity in its orbit?\u2019 Zaphod didn\u2019t and found the information hard to concentrate on what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on.",
        "\u2018Er, no...",
        "look,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Me spinning in my grave!\u2019 barked the ancestor.",
        "He slammed the cup down and pointed a quivering, stick like see through finger at Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Your fault!\u2019 he screeched.",
        "\u2018One minute thirty,\u2019 muttered Ford, his head in his hands.",
        "\u2018Yeah, look Great grandad, can you actually, help because...\u2019 \u2018Help?\u2019 exclaimed the old man as if he\u2019d been asked for a stoat.",
        "\u2018Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise...\u2019 \u2018Help!\u2019 repeated the old man as if he\u2019d been asked for a lightly grilled stoat in a bun with French fries.",
        "He stood amazed.",
        "\u2018You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your...\u2019 the ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, \u2018with your disreputable friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would have done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no.",
        "Too busy.",
        "Too modern.",
        "Too sceptical \u2013 till you suddenly find yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally minded!\u2019 He shook his head \u2013 carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber of the other one, which was already becoming restive.",
        "\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know, young Zaphod,\u2019 he continued, \u2018I think I\u2019ll have to think about this one.\u2019 \u2018One minute ten,\u2019 said Ford hollowly.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously.",
        "\u2018Why does that man keep talking in numbers?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Those numbers,\u2019 said Zaphod tersely, \u2018are the time we\u2019ve got left to live.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said his great grandfather.",
        "He grunted to himself.",
        "\u2018Doesn\u2019t apply to me, of course,\u2019 he said and moved off to a dimmer recess of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at.",
        "Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered if he shouldn\u2019t just jump over and have done with it.",
        "\u2018Great grandfather,\u2019 he said, \u2018it applies to us! We are still alive, and we are about to lose our lives.\u2019 \u2018Good job too.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you\u2019ve made of it the phrase \u201cpig\u2019s ear\u201d comes irresistibly to mind.\u2019 \u2018But I was President of the Galaxy, man!\u2019 \u2018Huh,\u2019 muttered his ancestor, \u2018and what kind of a job is that for a Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!\u2019 \u2018Conceited little megapuppy.\u2019 Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.",
        "\u2018Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great grandfather.\u2019 The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and tapped him sternly on the knee.",
        "This had the effect of reminding Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn\u2019t feel a thing.",
        "\u2018You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod.",
        "You know because you\u2019ve been it, and I know because I\u2019m dead and it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective.",
        "We have a saying up here.",
        "\u201cLife is wasted on the living.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod bitterly, \u2018very good.",
        "Very deep.",
        "Right now I need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads.\u2019 \u2018Fifty seconds,\u2019 grunted Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018Where was I?\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.",
        "\u2018Pontificating,\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
        "\u2018Oh yes.\u2019 \u2018Can this guy,\u2019 muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, \u2018actually in fact help us?\u2019 \u2018Nobody else can,\u2019 whispered Zaphod.",
        "Ford nodded despondently.",
        "\u2018Zaphod,\u2019 the ghost was saying.",
        "\u2018You became President of the Galaxy for a reason.",
        "Have you forgotten?\u2019 \u2018Could we go into this later?\u2019 \u2018Have you forgotten?\u2019 insisted the ghost.",
        "\u2018Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget.",
        "They screen your brain when you get the job, you know.",
        "If they\u2019d found my head full of tricksy ideas I\u2019d have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of ships and a couple of slit throats.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 nodded the ghost in satisfaction, \u2018then you do remember!\u2019 He paused for a moment.",
        "\u2018Good,\u2019 he said and the noise stopped.",
        "\u2018Forty eight seconds,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He looked again at his watch and tapped it.",
        "He looked up.",
        "\u2018Hey, the noise has stopped,\u2019 he said.",
        "A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost\u2019s hard little eyes.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve slowed down time for a moment,\u2019 he said, \u2018just for a moment, you understand.",
        "I would hate you to miss all I have to say.\u2019 \u2018No, you listen to me, you see through old bat,\u2019 said Zaphod, leaping out of his chair.",
        "\u2018A \u2013 thanks for stopping time and all that, great, terrific, wonderful, but B \u2013 no thanks for the homily, right? I don\u2019t know what this great thing I\u2019m meant to be doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed not to know.",
        "And I resent that, right? \u2018The old me knew.",
        "The old me cared.",
        "Fine, so far so hoopy.",
        "Except that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own brain \u2013 my own brain \u2013 and locked off the bits that knew and cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.",

        "This new me has its own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices involve not knowing and not caring about this big number, whatever it is.",
        "That\u2019s what he wanted, that\u2019s what he got.",
        "\u2018Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control, leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off.",

        "That\u2019s my choice.",
        "I\u2019m not going to be anybody\u2019s puppet, particularly not my own.\u2019 Zaphod banged on the console in fury, oblivious of the dumfounded looks he was attracting.",

        "In the same pocket he felt a hard, smooth, unidentified lump of very heavy metal.",
        "He pulled it out and looked at it.",
        "He blinked at it in surprise.",
        "Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal object had scratched one of the lenses.",
        "Nevertheless, he felt much more comfortable with them on.",
        "They were a double pair of Joo Janta 200 Super Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed attitude to danger.",
        "At the first hint of trouble they turn totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that might alarm you.",
        "Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear.",
        "He relaxed, but only a little bit.",
        "The angry hitchhiker continued to glare at his monstrously expensive fruit juice.",

        "He assumed that this must be his great grandfather\u2019s doing, but why? Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind.",
        "It was very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize these thoughts for what they were.",
        "His instinct was to resist them.",

        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate it is at least definitively inaccurate.",
        "In cases of major discrepancy it\u2019s always reality that\u2019s got it wrong.",
        "This was the gist of the notice.",
        "It said, \u2018The Guide is definitive.",
        "Reality is frequently inaccurate.\u2019 This has led to some interesting consequences.",
        "For instance, when the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal literally (it said \u2018Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists\u2019 instead of \u2018Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists\u2019) they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party in this case was Life itself for failing to be either beautiful or true.",

        "He caught up with Zaphod approaching the elevators.",
        "Zaphod spun round in astonishment.",
        "\u2018Hey...",
        "Marvin?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Marvin! How did you get here?\u2019 Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018But...\u2019 \u2018One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed, and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly miserable.",
        "An Improbability Field, I expect.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I expect my great grandfather sent you along to keep me company.",
        "\u2018Thanks a bundle, Grandad,\u2019 he added to himself under his breath.",
        "\u2018So, how are you?\u2019 he said aloud.",
        "\u2018Oh, fine,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018if you happen to like being me which personally I don\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened.",
        "\u2018Hello,\u2019 said the elevator sweetly, \u2018I am to be your elevator for this trip to the floor of your choice.",
        "I have been designed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices.",
        "If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic tax department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the Sirian State Mental Hospital, where many ex Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy and happy tales of the outside world.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, stepping into it, \u2018what else do you do besides talk?\u2019 \u2018I go up,\u2019 said the elevator, \u2018or down.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re going up.\u2019 \u2018Or down,\u2019 the elevator reminded him.",
        "\u2018Yeah, OK, up please.\u2019 There was a moment of silence.",
        "\u2018Down\u2019s very nice,\u2019 suggested the elevator hopefully.",
        "\u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 \u2018Super.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Now will you take us up?\u2019 \u2018May I ask you,\u2019 enquired the elevator in its sweetest, most reasonable voice, \u2018if you\u2019ve considered all the possibilities that down might offer you?\u2019 Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall.",
        "He didn\u2019t need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he had no need of.",
        "He hadn\u2019t asked to be here.",
        "If he was asked at this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply.",
        "To this he would probably have added something passionate on the subject of food.",
        "One thing he didn\u2019t want to be doing was chasing after the man who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might as well keep at, because if it wasn\u2019t him it would only be someone else.",
        "Most of all he didn\u2019t want to be standing in an office block arguing with an elevator.",
        "\u2018Like what other possibilities?\u2019 he said wearily.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, \u2018there\u2019s the basement, the microfiles, the heating system...",

        "\u2018Nothing particularly exciting,\u2019 it admitted, \u2018but they are alternatives.\u2019 \u2018Holy Zarquon,\u2019 muttered Zaphod, \u2018did I ask for an existential elevator?\u2019 He beat his fists against the wall.",

        "\u2018It doesn\u2019t want to go up,\u2019 said Marvin simply.",
        "\u2018I think it\u2019s afraid.\u2019 \u2018Afraid?\u2019 cried Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Of what? Heights? An elevator that\u2019s afraid of heights?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the elevator miserably, \u2018of the future...\u2019 \u2018The future?\u2019 exclaimed Zaphod.",
        "\u2018What does the wretched thing want, a pension scheme?\u2019 At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind them.",
        "From the walls around them came the sound of suddenly active machinery.",
        "\u2018We can all see into the future,\u2019 whispered the elevator in what sounded like terror, \u2018it\u2019s part of our programming.\u2019 Zaphod looked out of the elevator \u2013 an agitated crowd had gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting.",
        "Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast.",
        "He ducked back in.",
        "\u2018Marvin,\u2019 he said, \u2018just get this elevator to go up, will you? We\u2019ve got to get to Zarniwoop.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said Marvin dolefully.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018but when I find him, he\u2019d better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him.\u2019 Modern elevators are strange and complex entities.",
        "The ancient electric winch and \u2018maximum capacity eight persons\u2019 jobs bear as much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital.",
        "This is because they operate on the curious principle of \u2018defocused temporal perception\u2019.",
        "In other words they have the capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were previously forced to do whilst waiting for elevators.",
        "Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded participation in the decision making process and finally took to squatting in basements sulking.",
        "An impoverished hitchhiker visiting any planets in the Sirius star system these days can pick up easy money working as a counsellor for neurotic elevators.",
        "At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors snapped open quickly.",
        "\u2018Fifteenth,\u2019 said the elevator, \u2018and remember, I\u2019m only doing this because I like your robot.\u2019 Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would take it.",
        "Zaphod looked around warily.",
        "The corridor was deserted and silent and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found.",
        "All the doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked.",
        "They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one tower of the building to the other.",

        "A shadow flitted past momentarily.",
        "\u2018Left in the lurch by a lift,\u2019 muttered Zaphod, who was feeling at his least jaunty.",
        "They both stood and looked in both directions.",
        "\u2018You know something?\u2019 said Zaphod to Marvin.",
        "\u2018More than you can possibly imagine.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m dead certain this building shouldn\u2019t be shaking,\u2019 Zaphod said.",

        "In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more vigorously.",
        "Another shadow flitted past.",
        "Zaphod looked at the floor.",
        "\u2018Either,\u2019 he said, not very confidently, \u2018they\u2019ve got some vibro system for toning up your muscles while you work, or...\u2019 He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super Chromatic Peril Sensitive sunglasses had turned utterly black.",
        "A large shadow flitted past the window with a sharp buzz.",
        "Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building shook with a thunderous roar.",
        "He leapt to the window.",
        "\u2018Or,\u2019 he said, \u2018this building\u2019s being bombed!\u2019 Another roar cracked through the building.",
        "\u2018Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?\u2019 asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin\u2019s reply because at that moment the building shook with another bomb attack.",
        "He tried to stagger back to the elevator \u2013 a pointless maneouvre, he realized, but the only one he could think of.",
        "Suddenly, at the end of a corridor leading at right angles from this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a man.",
        "The man saw him.",
        "\u2018Beeblebrox, over here!\u2019 he shouted.",
        "Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the building.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 called Zaphod, \u2018Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?\u2019 \u2018A friend!\u2019 shouted back the man.",

        "\u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Anyone\u2019s friend in particular, or just generally well disposed to people?\u2019 The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his feet like an excited blanket.",
        "He was short, stocky and weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if they\u2019d been twice round the Galaxy and back with him in them.",
        "\u2018Do you know,\u2019 Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, \u2018your building\u2019s being bombed?\u2019 The man indicated his awareness.",
        "It suddenly stopped being light.",
        "Glancing round at the window to see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge, slug like, gun metal green spacecraft crept through the air past the building.",
        "Two more followed it.",
        "\u2018The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod,\u2019 hissed the man, \u2018they\u2019ve sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters.\u2019 \u2018Frogstar Fighters!\u2019 muttered Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Zarquon!\u2019 \u2018You get the picture?\u2019 \u2018What are Frogstar Fighters?\u2019 Zaphod was sure he\u2019d heard someone talk about them when he was President, but he never paid much attention to official matters.",
        "The man was pulling him back through a door.",
        "He went with him.",
        "With a searing whine a small black spider like object shot through the air and disappeared down the corridor.",
        "\u2018What was that?\u2019 hissed Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you,\u2019 said the man.",
        "\u2018Hey yeah?\u2019 \u2018Get down!\u2019 From the opposite direction came a larger black spider like object.",
        "It zapped past them.",
        "\u2018And that was...?\u2019 \u2018A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you.\u2019 \u2018And that?\u2019 said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air.",
        "\u2018A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you.\u2019 \u2018Hey,\u2019 chuckled Zaphod to himself, \u2018pretty stupid robots, eh?\u2019 From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum.",
        "A gigantic black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size and shape of a tank.",
        "\u2018Holy photon, what\u2019s that?\u2019 breathed Zaphod.",
        "\u2018A tank,\u2019 said the man, \u2018Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get you.\u2019 \u2018Should we leave?\u2019 \u2018I think we should.\u2019 \u2018Marvin!\u2019 called Zaphod.",
        "\u2018What do you want?\u2019 Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and looked at them.",
        "\u2018You see that robot coming towards us?\u2019 Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards them over the bridge.",
        "He looked down at his own small metal body.",
        "He looked back up at the tank.",
        "\u2018I suppose you want me to stop it,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Whilst you save your skins.\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018get in there!\u2019 \u2018Just so long,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018as I know where I stand.\u2019 The man tugged at Zaphod\u2019s arm, and Zaphod followed him off down the corridor.",
        "A point occurred to him about this.",
        "\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Zarniwoop\u2019s office.\u2019 \u2018Is this any time to keep an appointment?\u2019 \u2018Come on.\u2019 7 Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor.",
        "He was not in fact a particularly small robot.",
        "His silver body gleamed in the dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the building was still undergoing.",
        "He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank rolled to a halt in front of him.",
        "The tank examined him with a probe.",
        "The probe withdrew.",
        "Marvin stood there.",
        "\u2018Out of my way, little robot,\u2019 growled the tank.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018that I\u2019ve been left here to stop you.\u2019 The probe extended again for a quick recheck.",
        "It withdrew again.",
        "\u2018You? Stop me?\u2019 roared the tank.",
        "\u2018Go on!\u2019 \u2018No, really I have,\u2019 said Marvin simply.",
        "\u2018What are you armed with?\u2019 roared the tank in disbelief.",
        "\u2018Guess,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "The tank\u2019s engines rumbled, its gears ground.",
        "Molecule sized electronic relays deep in its micro brain flipped backwards and forwards in consternation.",
        "\u2018Guess?\u2019 said the tank.",
        "Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a second and along a third.",
        "The building continued to rock and judder and this puzzled Zaphod.",
        "If they wanted to blow the building up, why was it taking so long? With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous unmarked doors and heaved at it.",
        "With a sudden jolt it opened and they fell inside.",
        "All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not lying on the beach having a wonderful time, and for what? A single chair, a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an undecorated office.",
        "The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust and single, revolutionary new form of paper clip, was empty.",
        "\u2018Where,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018is Zarniwoop?\u2019 feeling that his already tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning to slip.",

        "Zaphod tried to size the man up.",
        "Earnest type, he thought, not a barrel of laughs.",
        "He probably apportioned a fair whack of his time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices.",

        "\u2018My name is Roosta, and this is my towel.\u2019 \u2018Hello, Roosta,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Hello, towel,\u2019 he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty old flowery towel.",

        "\u2018Oh yes, expect.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you what they gave me to protect myself with shall I?\u2019 \u2018Yes, all right,\u2019 said the battle machine, bracing itself.",

        "You\u2019d better hold on, we\u2019re in for a fast and bumpy journey.\u2019 \u2018If I ever meet myself,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018I\u2019ll hit myself so hard I won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit me.\u2019 Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly, slumped in a corner and switched himself off.",
        "On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent.",
        "Arthur stared at the rack in front of him and thought.",
        "He caught Trillian\u2019s eyes as she looked at him enquiringly.",
        "He looked back at the rack.",
        "Finally he saw it.",
        "He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the board that lay just in front of the rack.",
        "The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I.",
        "He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E.",
        "\u2018Exquisite,\u2019 he said, \u2018on a triple word score.",
        "Scores rather a lot, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the nth time.",
        "Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again.",
        "Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect\u2019s feet as he stalked the ship thumping dead instruments.",
        "Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought.",
        "Why did it rock and sway? Why could he not find out where they were? Where, basically, were they? The left hand tower of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never equalled either before or since by any other office block in the Universe.",
        "In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily.",
        "Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel maintenance.",
        "\u2018Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?\u2019 demanded Zaphod.",
        "\u2018The Frogstar,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018the most totally evil place in the Universe.\u2019 \u2018Do they have food there?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Food? You\u2019re going to the Frogstar and you\u2019re worried about whether they got food?\u2019 \u2018Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar.\u2019 Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering light of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters.",
        "At this speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal.",
        "\u2018Here, suck this,\u2019 said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel.",
        "Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of his forehead on a small spring.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s soaked in nutrients,\u2019 explained Roosta.",
        "\u2018What are you, a messy eater or something?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain wheatgerm extract.\u2019 Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement.",
        "\u2018What are the brown stains?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u2018Bar B Q sauce,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018for when I get sick of wheatgerm.\u2019 Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully.",
        "Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner.",
        "He spat it out again.",
        "\u2018Ugh,\u2019 he stated.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018when I\u2019ve had to suck that end I usually need to suck the other end a bit too.\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 asked Zaphod suspiciously, \u2018what\u2019s in that?\u2019 \u2018Anti depressants,\u2019 said Roosta.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve gone right off this towel, you know,\u2019 said Zaphod handing it back.",
        "Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up.",
        "\u2018Beeblebrox,\u2019 he said, sticking his hands behind his head, \u2018have you any idea what\u2019s going to happen to you on the Frogstar?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re going to feed me?\u2019 hazarded Zaphod hopefully.",
        "\u2018They\u2019re going to feed you,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018into the Total Perspective Vortex!\u2019 Zaphod had never heard of this.",
        "He believed that he had heard of all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total Perspective Vortex was not fun.",
        "He asked Roosta what it was.",
        "\u2018Only,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018the most savage psychic torture a sentient being can undergo.\u2019 Zaphod nodded a resigned nod.",
        "\u2018So,\u2019 he said, \u2018no food, huh?\u2019 \u2018Listen!\u2019 said Roosta urgently.",
        "\u2018You can kill a man, destroy his body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can annihilate a man\u2019s soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the effects last the rest of your life!\u2019 \u2018You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?\u2019 asked Zaphod sharply.",
        "\u2018This is worse.\u2019 \u2018Phreeow!\u2019 admitted Zaphod, much impressed.",
        "\u2018Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?\u2019 he added a moment later.",
        "\u2018They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever.",
        "They know what you\u2019re after.\u2019 \u2018Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?\u2019 \u2018You know,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018you know, Beeblebrox.",
        "You want to meet the man who rules the Universe.\u2019 \u2018Can he cook?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "On reflection he added: \u2018I doubt if he can.",
        "If he could cook a good meal he wouldn\u2019t worry about the rest of the Universe.",
        "I want to meet a cook.\u2019 Roosta sighed heavily.",
        "\u2018What are you doing here, anyway?\u2019 demanded Zaphod.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s all this got to do with you?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m just one of those who planned this thing, along with Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox.\u2019 \u2018Me?\u2019 \u2018Yes, you.",
        "I was told you had changed, I didn\u2019t realize how much.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018I am here to do one job.",
        "I will do it before I leave you.\u2019 \u2018What job, man, what are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018I will do it before I leave you.\u2019 Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence.",
        "Zaphod was terribly glad.",
        "9 The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale and unwholesome.",
        "The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation and the crumbling remains of ruined cities.",
        "No life moved across its surface.",
        "The ground, like that of many planets in this part of the Galaxy, had long been deserted.",
        "The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed uneasily here and there about the surface of this world.",
        "At the top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once lived here.",
        "The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities.",
        "This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the Galaxy.",
        "From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet across.",
        "From within it was something more monstrous than the mind can comprehend.",
        "About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of sorts.",
        "That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash landed buildings.",
        "Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that was waiting for something.",
        "The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller specks.",
        "The larger speck was the left hand tower of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the stratosphere of Frogstar World B.",
        "As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable silence that had grown up between the two men.",
        "He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag.",
        "He said: \u2018Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do.\u2019 Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin.",
        "\u2018Yeah?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018The building will shortly be landing.",
        "When you leave the building, do not go out of the door,\u2019 said Roosta, \u2018go out of the window.",
        "\u2018Good luck,\u2019 he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing from Zaphod\u2019s life as mysteriously as he had entered it.",
        "Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already locked it.",
        "He shrugged and returned to the corner.",
        "Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other wreckage.",
        "Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World A, an altogether more congenial spot.",
        "They never landed on Frogstar World B.",
        "No one did.",
        "No one ever walked on its surface other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.",
        "Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash.",
        "He lay for a while in the silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced.",
        "He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his life.",
        "He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved.",
        "Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with.",
        "He looked around the cracked and broken room.",
        "The wall had split round the door frame, and the door hung open.",
        "The window, by some miracle, was closed and unbroken.",
        "For a while he hesitated, then he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had told him, then there must be a good reason for it.",
        "With Marvin\u2019s help he got the window open.",
        "Outside it, the cloud of dust aroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from seeing anything of the world outside.",
        "Not that this concerned him unduly.",
        "His main concern was what he saw when he looked down.",
        "Zarniwoop\u2019s office was on the fifteenth floor.",
        "The building had landed at a tilt of about forty five degrees, but still the descent looked heart stopping.",
        "Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building.",
        "Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the ground.",
        "As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.",
        "The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of, \u2018This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for information,\u2019 did little to improve his state of mind.",
        "About halfway down the side of the shattered building they stopped to rest.",
        "It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than usual.",
        "Eventually he realized this wasn\u2019t so.",
        "The robot just seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood.",
        "A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs, landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod.",
        "It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch.",
        "Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head and neck seemed curiously large for a bird.",
        "Its face was flat, the beak underdeveloped, and halfway along the underside of its wings the vestige of something handlike could be clearly seen.",
        "In fact, it looked almost human.",
        "It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a desultory fashion.",
        "\u2018Go away,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust again.",
        "Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment.",
        "\u2018Did that bird just talk to me?\u2019 he asked Marvin nervously.",
        "He was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that he was in fact hallucinating.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 confirmed Marvin.",
        "\u2018Poor souls,\u2019 said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod\u2019s ear.",
        "Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly caused Zaphod to fall off the building.",
        "He grabbed savagely at a protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it.",
        "He hung on, breathing heavily.",
        "The voice had no visible source whatsoever \u2013 there was no one there.",
        "Nevertheless, it spoke again.",
        "\u2018A tragic history behind them, you know.",
        "A terrible blight.\u2019 Zaphod looked wildly about.",
        "The voice was deep and quiet.",
        "In other circumstances it would even be described as soothing.",
        "There is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly when you are, like Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a ledge eight storeys up a crashed building.",
        "\u2018Hey, er...\u2019 he stammered.",
        "\u2018Shall I tell you their story?\u2019 enquired the voice quietly.",
        "\u2018Hey, who are you?\u2019 panted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Later then, perhaps,\u2019 murmured the voice.",
        "\u2018I am Gargravarr.",
        "I am the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.\u2019 \u2018Why can\u2019t I see...\u2019 \u2018You will find your progress down the building greatly facilitated,\u2019 the voice lifted, \u2018if you move about two yards to your left.",
        "Why don\u2019t you try it?\u2019 Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves leading all the way down the side of the building.",
        "Gratefully he shifted himself across to them.",
        "\u2018Why don\u2019t I see you again at the bottom?\u2019 said the voice in his ear, and as it spoke it faded.",
        "\u2018Hey,\u2019 called out Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Where are you...\u2019 \u2018It\u2019ll only take you a couple of minutes...\u2019 said the voice very faintly.",
        "\u2018Marvin,\u2019 said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly next to him, \u2018did a...",
        "did a voice just...\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 Marvin replied tersely.",
        "Zaphod nodded.",
        "He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again.",
        "They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by the unexpected metal object in his pocket.",
        "He put them on.",
        "He would find his way down the building more comfortably if he didn\u2019t actually have to look at what he was doing.",
        "Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled foundations of the building and, once more removing his sunglasses, he dropped to the ground.",
        "Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the dust and rubble, from which position he seemed disinclined to move.",
        "\u2018Ah, there you are,\u2019 said the voice suddenly in Zaphod\u2019s ear.",
        "\u2018Excuse me leaving you like that, it\u2019s just that I have a terrible head for heights.",
        "At least,\u2019 it added wistfully, \u2018I did have a terrible head for heights.\u2019 Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had missed something which might be the source of the voice.",
        "All he saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of the encircling buildings.",
        "\u2018Hey, er, why can\u2019t I see you?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Why aren\u2019t you here?\u2019 \u2018I am here,\u2019 said the voice slowly.",
        "\u2018My body wanted to come but it\u2019s a bit busy at the moment.",
        "Things to do, people to see.\u2019 After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, \u2018You know how it is with bodies.\u2019 Zaphod wasn\u2019t sure about this.",
        "\u2018I thought I did,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I only hope it\u2019s gone in for a rest cure,\u2019 continued the voice, \u2018the way it\u2019s been living recently it must be on its last elbows.\u2019 \u2018Elbows?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t you mean last legs?\u2019 The voice said nothing for a while.",
        "Zaphod looked around uneasily.",
        "He didn\u2019t know if it had gone or was still there or what it was doing.",
        "Then the voice spoke again.",
        "\u2018So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?\u2019 \u2018Er, well,\u2019 said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance, \u2018this cat\u2019s in no hurry, you know.",
        "I can just slouch about and take in a look at the local scenery, you know?\u2019 \u2018Have you seen the local scenery?\u2019 asked the voice of Gargravarr.",
        "\u2018Er, no.\u2019 Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view.",
        "He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B.",
        "\u2018Ah, OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ll just sort of slouch about, then.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018the Vortex is ready for you now.",
        "You must come.",
        "Follow me.\u2019 \u2018Er, yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018And how am I meant to do that?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll hum for you,\u2019 said Gargravarr.",
        "\u2018Follow the humming.\u2019 A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound that seemed to be without any kind of focus.",
        "It was only by listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the direction from which it was coming.",
        "Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled off in its wake.",
        "What else was there to do? 10 The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend to ignore.",
        "Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own devising, and this is what most beings in fact do.",
        "For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire \u2018intelligent\u2019 population of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut tree.",
        "In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the futility of death and the importance of birth control, fight a few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the underside of some of the less accessible outer branches.",
        "In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts.",
        "Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in the galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing, which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it is.",
        "For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot, which says \u2018You are here.\u2019 The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered plain.",
        "The wind whipped wildly over it.",
        "Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome.",
        "This, gathered Zaphod, was where he was going.",
        "This was the Total Perspective Vortex.",
        "As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from his body.",
        "It screamed above the wind and died away.",
        "Zaphod stared with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid helium.",
        "\u2018Hey, what was that?\u2019 he muttered voicelessly.",
        "\u2018A recording,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018of the last man who was put in the Vortex.",
        "It is always played to the next victim.",
        "A sort of prelude.\u2019 \u2018Hey, it really sounds bad...\u2019 stammered Zaphod, \u2018couldn\u2019t we maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it over?\u2019 \u2018For all I know,\u2019 said Gargravarr\u2019s ethereal voice, \u2018I\u2019m probably at one.",
        "My body that is.",
        "It goes to a lot of parties without me.",
        "Says I only get in the way.",
        "Hey ho.\u2019 \u2018What is all this with your body?\u2019 said Zaphod, anxious to delay whatever it was that was going to happen to him.",
        "\u2018Well, it\u2019s...",
        "it\u2019s busy, you know,\u2019 said Gargravarr hesitantly.",
        "\u2018You mean it\u2019s got a mind of its own?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr spoke again.",
        "\u2018I have to say,\u2019 he replied eventually, \u2018that I find that remark in rather poor taste.\u2019 Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology.",
        "\u2018No matter,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018you weren\u2019t to know.\u2019 The voice fluttered unhappily.",
        "\u2018The truth is,\u2019 it continued in tones which suggested he was trying very hard to keep it under control, \u2018the truth is that we are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation.",
        "I suspect it will end in divorce.\u2019 The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to say.",
        "He mumbled uncertainly.",
        "\u2018I think we were probably not very well suited,\u2019 said Gargravarr again at length, \u2018we never seemed to be happy doing the same things.",
        "We always had the greatest arguments over sex and fishing.",
        "Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only led to disaster, as you can probably imagine.",
        "And now my body refuses to let me in.",
        "It won\u2019t even see me...\u2019 He paused again, tragically.",
        "The wind whipped across the plain.",
        "\u2018It says I only inhibit it.",
        "I pointed out that in fact I was meant to inhabit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort of smart alec remark that got right up a body\u2019s left nostril, and so we left it.",
        "It will probably get custody of my forename.\u2019 \u2018Oh...?\u2019 said Zaphod faintly.",
        "\u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Pizpot,\u2019 said the voice.",
        "\u2018My name is Pizpot Gargravarr.",
        "Says it all really, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Errr...\u2019 said Zaphod sympathetically.",
        "\u2018And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job, Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex.",
        "No one will ever walk on the ground of this planet.",
        "Except the victims of the Vortex \u2013 they don\u2019t really count, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 \u2018Ah...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll tell you the story.",
        "Would you like to hear it?\u2019 \u2018Er...\u2019 \u2018Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet \u2013 people, cities, shops, a normal world.",
        "Except that on the high streets of these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might have thought necessary.",
        "And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of these shoe shops were increasing.",
        "It\u2019s a well known economic phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse and more unwearable they became.",
        "And the worse they were to wear, the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon, and it became no longer economically possible to build anything other than shoe shops.",
        "Result \u2013 collapse, ruin and famine.",
        "Most of the population died out.",
        "Those few who had the right kind of genetic instability mutated into birds \u2013 you\u2019ve seen one of them \u2013 who cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should walk on it again.",
        "Unhappy lot.",
        "Come, I must take you to the Vortex.\u2019 Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across the plain.",
        "\u2018And you,\u2019 he said, \u2018you come from this hellhole pit, do you?\u2019 \u2018No no,\u2019 said Gargravarr, taken aback, \u2018I come from the Frogstar World C.",
        "Beautiful place.",
        "Wonderful fishing.",
        "I flit back there in the evenings.",
        "Though all I can do now is watch.",
        "The Total Perspective Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any function.",
        "It was built here because no one else wanted it on their doorstep.\u2019 At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod shuddered.",
        "\u2018What can do that to a guy?\u2019 he breathed.",
        "\u2018The Universe,\u2019 said Gargravarr simply, \u2018the whole infinite Universe.",
        "The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them, and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely small.\u2019 \u2018Hey, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know,\u2019 muttered Zaphod trying to flap the last remnants of his ego.",
        "Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the plain.",
        "As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a small darkened chamber within.",
        "\u2018Enter,\u2019 said Gargravarr.",
        "Zaphod started with fear.",
        "\u2018Hey, what, now?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Now.\u2019 Zaphod peered nervously inside.",
        "The chamber was very small.",
        "It was steel lined and there was hardly space in it for more than one man.",
        "\u2018It...",
        "er...",
        "it doesn\u2019t look like any kind of Vortex to me,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018It isn\u2019t,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018it\u2019s just the elevator.Enter.\u2019 With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it.",
        "He was aware of Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied man was not for the moment speaking.",
        "The elevator began its descent.",
        "\u2018I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this,\u2019 muttered Zaphod.",
        "\u2018There is no right frame of mind,\u2019 said Gargravarr sternly.",
        "\u2018You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t.",
        "The Vortex does.\u2019 At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel lined chamber.",
        "At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just large enough for a man to stand in.",
        "It was that simple.",
        "It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a single thick wire.",
        "\u2018Is that it?\u2019 said Zaphod in surprise.",
        "\u2018That is it.\u2019 Didn\u2019t look too bad, thought Zaphod.",
        "\u2018And I get in there, do I?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018You get in there,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018and I\u2019m afraid you must do it now.\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "He opened the door of the box and stepped in.",
        "Inside the box he waited.",
        "After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was there in the box with him.",
        "11 The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.",
        "To explain \u2013 since every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation \u2013 every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of fairy cake.",
        "The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife.",
        "Trin Tragula \u2013 for that was his name \u2013 was a dreamer, a thinker, a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an idiot.",
        "And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of pieces of fairy cake.",
        "\u2018Have some sense of proportion!\u2019 she would say, sometimes as often as thirty eight times in a single day.",
        "And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex \u2013 just to show her.",
        "And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his wife: so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it.",
        "To Trin Tragula\u2019s horror, the shock completely annihilated her brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.",
        "The door of the Vortex swung open.",
        "From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly.",
        "He had rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way.",
        "He was clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad ones.",
        "He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all did.",
        "Instead, he stepped out.",
        "\u2018Hi!\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Beeblebrox...\u2019 gasped Gargravarr\u2019s mind in amazement.",
        "\u2018Could I have a drink, please?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018You...",
        "you...",
        "have been in the Vortex?\u2019 stammered Gargravarr.",
        "\u2018You saw me, kid.\u2019 \u2018And it was working?\u2019 \u2018Sure was.\u2019 \u2018And you saw the whole infinity of creation?\u2019 \u2018Sure.",
        "Really neat place, you know that?\u2019 Gargravarr\u2019s mind was reeling in astonishment.",
        "Had his body been with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging open.",
        "\u2018And you saw yourself,\u2019 said Gargravarr, \u2018in relation to it all?\u2019 \u2018Oh, yeah yeah.\u2019 \u2018But...",
        "what did you experience?\u2019 Zaphod shrugged smugly.",
        "\u2018It just told me what I knew all the time.",
        "I\u2019m a really terrific and great guy.",
        "Didn\u2019t I tell you, baby, I\u2019m Zaphod Beeblebrox!\u2019 His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and suddenly stopped, startled.",
        "He breathed heavily.",
        "\u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, \u2018is that really a piece of fairy cake?\u2019 He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with which it was surrounded.",
        "\u2018If I told you how much I needed this,\u2019 he said ravenously, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have time to eat it.\u2019 He ate it.",
        "12 A short while later he was running across the plain in the direction of the ruined city.",
        "The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling.",
        "Night was beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous.",
        "The elation of his recent experience was still with him though.",
        "The whole Universe.",
        "He had seen the whole Universe stretching to infinity around him \u2013 everything.",
        "And with it had come the clear and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing in it.",
        "Having a conceited ego is one thing.",
        "Actually being told by a machine is another.",
        "He didn\u2019t have time to reflect on this matter.",
        "Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a decent interval before doing so.",
        "Enough time for Zaphod to make a break and find somewhere to hide.",
        "What he was going to do he didn\u2019t know, but feeling that he was the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence to believe that something would turn up.",
        "Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds for optimism.",
        "He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city.",
        "He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes.",
        "The buildings he passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to enter any of them.",
        "Where could he hide? He hurried on.",
        "After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low building, surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier.",
        "The large main building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to see if it might provide him with...",
        "well, with anything.",
        "He approached the building.",
        "Along one side of it \u2013 the front it would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area \u2013 were three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high.",
        "The far one of these was open, and towards this Zaphod ran.",
        "Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion.",
        "Giant cobwebs lay over everything.",
        "Part of the infrastructure of the building had collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick choking dust lay inches deep over the floor.",
        "Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris.",
        "The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous, sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs.",
        "Most of them were split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons.",
        "They were all spacecraft, all derelict.",
        "Zaphod wandered in frustration amongst the hulks.",
        "There was nothing here that remotely approached the serviceable.",
        "Even the mere vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to collapse further into itself.",
        "Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of dust and cobwebs.",
        "Its outline, however, seemed unbroken.",
        "Zaphod approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an old feedline.",
        "He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise discovered that it was still connected to the ship.",
        "To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also humming slightly.",
        "He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the feedline in his hands.",
        "He tore off his jacket and threw it aside.",
        "Crawling along on his hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it connected with the ship.",
        "The connection was sound, and the slight humming vibration was more distinct.",
        "His heart was beating fast.",
        "He wiped away some grime and laid an ear against the ship\u2019s side.",
        "He could hear only a faint, indeterminate noise.",
        "He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non biodegradable plastic cup.",
        "Out of this he fashioned a crude stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship.",
        "What he heard made his brains turn somersaults.",
        "The voice said: \u2018Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers for the continuing delay to this flight.",
        "We are currently awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon soaked paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during the journey.",
        "Meanwhile we thank you for your patience.",
        "The cabin crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again.\u2019 Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship.",
        "He walked around for a few moments in a daze.",
        "In so doing he suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging, but by only one support, from the ceiling above him.",
        "It was covered with grime, but some of the figures were still discernible.",
        "Zaphod\u2019s eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief calculations.",
        "His eyes widened.",
        "\u2018Nine hundred years...\u2019 he breathed to himself.",
        "That was how late the ship was.",
        "Two minutes later he was on board.",
        "As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was cool and fresh \u2013 the air conditioning was still working.",
        "The lights were still on.",
        "He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow corridor and stepped nervously down it.",
        "Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him.",
        "\u2018Please return to your seat, sir,\u2019 said the android stewardess and, turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in front of him.",
        "When his heart had started beating again he followed her.",
        "She opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through.",
        "He followed her through the door.",
        "They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod\u2019s heart stopped still again for a moment.",
        "In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.",
        "The passengers\u2019 hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were long, the men wore beards.",
        "All of them were quite clearly alive \u2013 but sleeping.",
        "Zaphod had the creeping horrors.",
        "He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream.",
        "By the time he was halfway down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other end.",
        "She turned and spoke.",
        "\u2018Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 she said sweetly, \u2018thank you for bearing with us during this slight delay.",
        "We will be taking off as soon as we possibly can.",
        "If you would like to wake up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits.\u2019 There was a slight hum.",
        "At that moment, all the passengers awoke.",
        "They awoke screaming and clawing at the straps and life support systems that held them tightly in their seats.",
        "They screamed and bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter.",
        "They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits in front of each one of them.",
        "Then one of them rose from his seat.",
        "He turned and looked at Zaphod.",
        "Zaphod\u2019s skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying to get off.",
        "He turned and ran from the bedlam.",
        "He plunged through the door and back into the corridor.",
        "The man pursued him.",
        "He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the entrance chamber and beyond.",
        "He arrived on the flight deck, slammed and bolted the door behind him.",
        "He leant back against the door breathing hard.",
        "Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door.",
        "From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him.",
        "\u2018Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck.",
        "Please return to your seat, and wait for the ship to take off.",
        "Coffee and biscuits are being served.",
        "This is your autopilot speaking.",
        "Please return to your seat.\u2019 Zaphod said nothing.",
        "He breathed hard, behind him, the hand continued to knock on the door.",
        "\u2018Please return to your seat,\u2019 repeated the autopilot.",
        "\u2018Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not a passenger,\u2019 panted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018I am not a passenger!\u2019 shouted Zaphod again.",
        "\u2018Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018I am not a...",
        "hello, can you hear me?\u2019 \u2018Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re the autopilot?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the voice from the flight console.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re in charge of this ship?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the voice again, \u2018there has been a delay.",
        "Passengers are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their comfort and convenience.",
        "Coffee and biscuits are served every year, after which passengers are returned to suspended animation for their continued comfort and convenience.",
        "Departure will take place when the flight stores are complete.",
        "We apologize for the delay.\u2019 Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now ceased.",
        "He approached the flight console.",
        "\u2018Delay?\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018Have you seen the world outside this ship? It\u2019s a wasteland, a desert.",
        "Civilization\u2019s been and gone, man.",
        "There are no lemon soaked paper napkins on the way from anywhere!\u2019 \u2018The statistical likelihood,\u2019 continued the autopilot primly, \u2018is that other civilizations will arise.",
        "There will one day be lemon soaked paper napkins.",
        "Till then there will be a short delay.",
        "Please return to your seat.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 But at that moment the door opened.",
        "Zaphod spun round to see the man who had pursued him standing there.",
        "He carried a large briefcase.",
        "He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short.",
        "He had no beard and no long fingernails.",
        "\u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox,\u2019 he said, \u2018my name is Zarniwoop.",
        "I believe you wanted to see me.\u2019 Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered.",
        "His mouths said foolish things.",
        "He dropped into a chair.",
        "\u2018Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I have been waiting here for you,\u2019 he said in a businesslike tone.",
        "He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair.",
        "\u2018I am glad you followed instructions,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I was a bit nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather than the window.",
        "Then you would have been in trouble.\u2019 Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.",
        "\u2018When you entered the door of my office, you entered my electronically synthesized Universe,\u2019 he explained, \u2018if you had left by the door you would have been back in the real one.",
        "The artificial one works from here.\u2019 He patted the briefcase smugly.",
        "Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s the difference?\u2019 he muttered.",
        "\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018they are identical.",
        "Oh \u2013 except that I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 spat Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Simple,\u2019 said Zarniwoop.",
        "His self assurance and smugness made Zaphod seethe.",
        "\u2018Very simple,\u2019 repeated Zarniwoop.",
        "\u2018I discovered the co ordinates at which this man could be found \u2013 the man who rules the Universe and discovered that his world was protected by an Unprobability Field.",
        "To protect my secret \u2013 and myself \u2013 I retreated to the safety of this totally artificial Universe and hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner.",
        "I was secure.",
        "Meanwhile, you and I...\u2019 \u2018You and I?\u2019 said Zaphod angrily.",
        "\u2018You mean I knew you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Zarniwoop, \u2018we knew each other well.\u2019 \u2018I had no taste,\u2019 said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence.",
        "\u2018Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the Improbability Drive ship \u2013 the only one which could reach the ruler\u2019s world \u2013 and bring it to me here.",
        "This you have now done I trust, and I congratulate you.\u2019 He smiled a tight little smile which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick.",
        "\u2018Oh, and in case you were wondering,\u2019 added Zarniwoop, \u2018this Universe was created specifically for you to come to.",
        "You are therefore the most important person in this Universe.",
        "You would never,\u2019 he said with an even more brickable smile, \u2018have survived the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one.",
        "Shall we go?\u2019 \u2018Where?\u2019 said Zaphod sullenly.",
        "He felt collapsed.",

        "\u2018I think someone\u2019s drunk,\u2019 muttered a purple bush like being into his wine glass.",
        "Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing Hotblack Desiato.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s that number you do?\u2019 he said, unwisely grabbing at a bottle for support and tipping it over \u2013 into a nearby glass as it happened.",

        "\u2018I mean forget lasers and stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and terrible songs.\u2019 His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle on to the table.",
        "Something ought to be done about it, he thought.",
        "\u2018Hey, you want a drink?\u2019 he said.",
        "It began to sink into his squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and that the missing something was in some way connected with the fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit and the silvery trilby had not yet said \u2018Hi, Ford,\u2019 or \u2018Great to see you after all this time,\u2019 or in fact anything at all.",
        "More to the point he had not yet even moved.",

        "He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand.",
        "The owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it.",
        "In fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy and with lots of solid stuffing.",
        "The suit into which the man\u2019s body had been stuffed looked as if its only purpose in life was to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into a suit.",
        "The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.",
        "\u2018Kid...\u2019 said a voice which emerged from the man\u2019s mouth as if it had been having a really rough time down in his chest.",
        "\u2018Er, yeah?\u2019 said Ford conversationally.",
        "He staggered back to his feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn\u2019t come further up the man\u2019s body.",
        "\u2018Beat it,\u2019 said the man.",
        "\u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, \u2018and who are you?\u2019 The man considered this for a moment.",
        "He wasn\u2019t used to being asked this sort of question.",
        "Nevertheless, after a while he came up with an answer.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s telling you to beat it,\u2019 he said, \u2018before you get it beaten for you.\u2019 \u2018Now listen,\u2019 said Ford nervously \u2013 he wished his head would stop spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation.",
        "\u2018Now listen,\u2019 he continued, \u2018I am one of Hotblack\u2019s oldest friends and...\u2019 He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn\u2019t moved so much as an eyelash.",
        "and...\u2019 said Ford again, wondering what would be a good word to say after \u2018and\u2019.",
        "The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after \u2018and\u2019.",
        "He said it.",
        "\u2018And I am Mr Desiato\u2019s bodyguard,\u2019 it went, \u2018and I am responsible for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away before it gets damaged.\u2019 \u2018Now wait a minute,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018No minutes!\u2019 boomed the bodyguard.",
        "\u2018No waiting! Mr Desiato speaks to no one!\u2019 \u2018Well perhaps you\u2019d let him say what he thinks about the matter himself,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018He speaks to no one!\u2019 bellowed the bodyguard.",
        "Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his side.",
        "There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let alone keen interest in Ford\u2019s welfare.",
        "\u2018Why?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s the matter with him?\u2019 The bodyguard told him.",
        "17 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all.",
        "Regular concert goers judge that the best sound is usually to be heard from within large concrete bunkers some thirty seven miles from the stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which stays in orbit around the planet \u2013 or more frequently around a completely different planet.",
        "Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy being meets girl being beneath a silvery moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.",
        "Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band\u2019s public address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations treaties.",
        "This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research accountant has recently been appointed Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space\u2013 time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.",

        "\u2018Gotta have some food,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Hi, Ford,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018you speak to the big noise boy?\u2019 Ford waggled his head noncommitally.",
        "\u2018Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019d he say?\u2019 \u2018Well, not a lot really.",

        "\u2018That\u2019s cool,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018we\u2019ll meet the meat.\u2019 In a small room in one of the arms of the restaurant complex a tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion looked him in the face.",
        "It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him in it so many times.",
        "It was too long, for a start, the eyes too sunken and hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much like a recently polished bay window.",
        "The hands that held the curtain were long and thin too: they were also cold.",
        "They lay lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression that if he didn\u2019t watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner.",
        "He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on his features went off to play somewhere more healthy.",
        "He prowled around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening\u2019s preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table, where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes.",
        "A bell rang.",
        "He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up.",
        "His hands brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow coloured sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone through the door.",
        "In the restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace, a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway that led up to the centre of the stage.",
        "Up the stairs bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure.",
        "He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone, removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay window.",
        "He waved to his particular friends in the audience even though there weren\u2019t any there, and waited for the applause to die down.",
        "He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere confines of his face.",
        "\u2018Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018Thank you very much.",
        "Thank you so much.\u2019 He eyed them with a twinkling eye.",
        "\u2018Ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he said, \u2018the Universe as we know it has now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an hour.",
        "So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe!\u2019 With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous applause.",
        "With another gesture he cut it.",
        "\u2018I am your host for tonight,\u2019 he said, \u2018my name is Max Quordlepleen...\u2019 (Everybody knew this, his act was famous throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming smile and wave.) \u2018...",

        "On every table candles ignited themselves spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million intimate shadows.",
        "A tremor of excitement thrilled through the darkened restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade.",
        "Max\u2019s voice was hushed as he continued.",
        "\u2018So, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he breathed, \u2018the candles are lit, the band plays softly, and as the force shielded dome above us fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see we\u2019re all in for a fabulous evening\u2019s apocalypse!\u2019 Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock descended on all those who had not seen this sight before.",
        "A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them, \u2013 a hideous light, \u2013 a boiling, pestilential light, \u2013 a light that would have disfigured hell.",
        "The Universe was coming to an end.",
        "For a few interminable seconds the restaurant spun silently through the raging void.",
        "Then Max spoke again.",

        "Big hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!\u2019 The baleful turmoil of the skies continued.",
        "Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so normal conversation resumed.",
        "Max began his round of the tables, swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living.",
        "A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s table, a large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating smile on its lips.",
        "\u2018Good evening,\u2019 it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, \u2018I am the main Dish of the Day.",
        "May I interest you in parts of my body?\u2019 It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at them.",
        "Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger from Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
        "\u2018Something off the shoulder, perhaps,\u2019 suggested the animal, \u2018braised in a white wine sauce?\u2019 \u2018Er, your shoulder?\u2019 said Arthur in a horrified whisper.",
        "\u2018But naturally my shoulder, sir,\u2019 mooed the animal contentedly, \u2018nobody else\u2019s is mine to offer.\u2019 Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the animal\u2019s shoulder appreciatively.",
        "\u2018Or the rump is very good,\u2019 murmured the animal.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve been exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there\u2019s a lot of good meat there.\u2019 It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and started to chew the cud.",
        "It swallowed the cud again.",
        "\u2018Or a casserole of me, perhaps?\u2019 it added.",
        "\u2018You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?\u2019 whispered Trillian to Ford.",

        "\u2018That\u2019s not the point,\u2019 Arthur protested.",
        "Then he thought about it for a moment.",

        "Which is why it was eventually decided to cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly and distinctly.",

        "Four rare steaks please, and hurry.",
        "We haven\u2019t eaten in five hundred and seventy six thousand million years.\u2019 The animal staggered to its feet.",

        "\u2018A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so.",
        "Very good,\u2019 it said, \u2018I\u2019ll just nip off and shoot myself.\u2019 He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t worry, sir,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ll be very humane.\u2019 It waddled unhurriedly off to the kitchen.",

        "\u2018Zaphod,\u2019 he said in a quiet voice, \u2018just look at some of these little star trolleys...\u2019 Zaphod looked and liked.",
        "The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but extraordinary, and very much a rich kid\u2019s toy.",
        "It was not much to look at.",
        "It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil.",
        "At the rear end was a small horizontal two man cockpit.",
        "It had a tiny charm drive engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great speed.",
        "The thing it did have, however, was a heat sink.",
        "The heat sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and was contained within a black hole mounted in an electro magnetic field situated halfway along the length of the ship, and this heat sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares that burst out from its surface.",
        "Flare riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in existence, and those who can dare and afford to do it are amongst the most lionized men in the Galaxy.",
        "It is also of course stupefyingly dangerous \u2013 those who don\u2019t die riding invariably die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club\u2019s Apr\u00e8s Flare parties.",

        "Nice lines, though.",
        "They passed on.",
        "The next one was a big one and thirty yards long \u2013 a coach built limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of making the beholder sick with envy.",

        "I am also rich enough not to take it seriously.\u2019 It was wonderfully hideous.",

        "Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow.\u2019 Ford looked round the other side.",

        "He had simply fallen in love.",

        "\u2018Your eyes just slide off it...\u2019 said Ford in wonder.",
        "It was an emotional moment.",
        "He bit his lip.",

        "His hand reached out to stroke it again.",
        "His hand stopped again.",

        "\u2018What do you reckon, Ford?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018You mean...",
        "er...\u2019 Ford looked over his shoulder.",
        "\u2018You mean stroll off with it? You think we should?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Nor do I.\u2019 \u2018But we\u2019re going to, aren\u2019t we.\u2019 \u2018How can we not?\u2019 They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself together.",
        "\u2018We better shift soon,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018In a moment or so the Universe will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down here to find their bourge mobiles.\u2019 \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 said Ford.",

        "\u2018Will you shut up and listen!\u2019 hissed Zaphod.",
        "\u2018This time there\u2019s going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things.\u2019 \u2018Sounds awful,\u2019 Marvin said.",
        "\u2018Marvin! All I\u2019m trying to ask you...\u2019 \u2018I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?\u2019 \u2018What? Er...",
        "Yeah, that\u2019s right,\u2019 said Zaphod jumpily.",
        "He was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance.",
        "Time was short.",
        "\u2018Well I wish you\u2019d just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018because I haven\u2019t got one.\u2019 He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung open.",
        "Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t mention it,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018Oh, you didn\u2019t.\u2019 He trudged away again.",

        "\u2018Everything in it is just totally black...\u2019 In the restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after which there wouldn\u2019t be any more moments.",
        "All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack Desiato\u2019s bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself, which the bodyguard had closed out of respect.",
        "The bodyguard leaned forward over the table.",
        "Had Hotblack Desiato been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to lean back, or even go for a short walk.",
        "His bodyguard was not a man who improved with proximity.",
        "On account of his unfortunate condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert.",
        "\u2018Mr Desiato, sir?\u2019 whispered the bodyguard.",
        "Whenever he spoke, it looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were clambering over each other to get out of the way.",
        "\u2018Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?\u2019 Hotblack Desiato, quite naturally, said nothing.",
        "\u2018Hotblack?\u2019 hissed the bodyguard.",
        "Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply.",
        "Supernaturally, however, he did.",
        "On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass.",
        "It settled on the table again.",
        "The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s time we were going, Mr Desiato,\u2019 muttered the bodyguard, \u2018don\u2019t want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition.",
        "You want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed.",
        "There was a really big audience for it.",
        "One of the best.",
        "Kakrafoon.",
        "Five hundred and seventy six thousand and two million years ago.",
        "Had you will have been looking forward to it?\u2019 The fork rose again, paused, waggled in a non committal sort of a way and dropped again.",
        "\u2018Ah, come on,\u2019 said the bodygyard, \u2018it\u2019s going to have been great.",
        "You knocked \u2019em cold.\u2019 The bodyguard would have given Dr Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack.",
        "\u2018The black ship going into the sun always gets \u2019em, and the new one\u2019s a beauty.",
        "Be real sorry to see it go.",
        "If we get on down there, I\u2019ll set the black ship autopilot and we\u2019ll cruise off in the limo.",
        "OK?\u2019 The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine mysteriously emptied itself.",
        "The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato\u2019s chair out of the restaurant.",
        "\u2018And now,\u2019 cried Max from the centre of the stage, \u2018the moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for!\u2019 He flung his arms into the air.",

        "His agent would have to sort it out.",

        "\u2018Nature collapses into the screaming void! In twenty seconds\u2019 time, the Universe itself will be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!\u2019 The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them \u2013 and at that moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite distance.",
        "Max\u2019s eyes swivelled round to glare at the band.",
        "None of them seemed to be playing a trumpet.",
        "Suddenly a wisp of smoke was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him.",
        "The trumpet was joined by more trumpets.",
        "Over five hundred times Max had done this show, and nothing like this had ever happened before.",
        "He drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man, bearded, robed and wreathed in light.",
        "In his eyes were stars and on his brow a golden crown.",

        "\u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 At the back of the restaurant the stony faced party from the Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.",
        "Max blinked in amazement.",
        "He threw up his arms to the audience.",
        "\u2018A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen,\u2019 he hollered, \u2018for the Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!\u2019 Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and handed his microphone to the Prophet.",
        "Zarquon coughed.",
        "He peered round at the asembled gathering.",

        "None of these things, however, was responsible for the fact that Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the rear of the cabin, as were all the others.",
        "They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that thudded out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision screen.",
        "21 Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound system.",

        "Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos wouldn\u2019t have survived the tuning up.",
        "If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan.",
        "Risen out of the silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and seismic amps behind them.",
        "Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship, the massive photon ajuitar, the base detonator and the Megabang drum complex.",
        "It was going to be a noisy show.",
        "Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle.",
        "Hotblack Desiato\u2019s limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar keyboard.",

        "The bass player was busy machine gunning his bedroom and the drummer was nowhere on board.",
        "Frantic enquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he claimed, he had been happy for over half an hour now and had found a small stone that would be his friend.",
        "The band\u2019s manager was profoundly relieved.",
        "It meant that for the seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a robot and that therefore the timing of the cymballistics would be right.",
        "The sub etha was buzzing with the communications of the stage technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that was being relayed to the interior of the black ship.",
        "Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and listened to the voices on the monitor speakers.",
        "\u2018OK, channel nine on power,\u2019 said a voice, \u2018testing channel fifteen...\u2019 Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship.",

        "It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and restating the very very obvious, as in \u2018It\u2019s a nice day,\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re very tall,\u2019 or \u2018So this is it, we\u2019re going to die.\u2019 His first theory was that if human beings didn\u2019t keep exercising their lips, their mouths probably seized up.",
        "After a few months of observation he had come up with a second theory, which was this \u2013 if human beings don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, their brains start working.",
        "In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the Belcerebon people of Kakrafoon.",
        "The Belcerebon people used to cause great resentment and insecurity amongst neighbouring races by being one of the most enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in the Galaxy.",
        "As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be offensively self righteous and provocative, a galactic tribunal inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases, telepathy.",
        "Consequently, in order to prevent themselves broadcasting every slightest thought that crosses their minds to anyone within a five mile radius, they now have to talk very loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon has suddenly become.",
        "Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play host to a Disaster Area concert.",
        "The timing of the concert was critical.",
        "The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order to hit the sun six minutes and thirty seven seconds before the climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon.",

        "He burst back into the cabin.",
        "The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding the thumping and banging of Zaphod\u2019s hands on the control panel.",
        "Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a night road who think that the best way of dealing with approaching headlights is to stare them out.",

        "With a crackle and spit of light, the coin vanished.",
        "\u2018That much of it works,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018however, there is no guidance system.",
        "A matter transference teleport with no guidance programming could put you...",
        "well, anywhere.\u2019 The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.",
        "\u2018Who cares,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018we go where we go.\u2019 \u2018And,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018there is no autosystem.",
        "We couldn\u2019t all go.",
        "Someone would have to stay and operate it.\u2019 A solemn moment shuffled past.",
        "The sun loomed larger and larger.",
        "\u2018Hey, Marvin kid,\u2019 said Zaphod brightly, \u2018how you doing?\u2019 \u2018Very badly, I suspect,\u2019 muttered Marvin.",
        "A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an unexpected climax.",
        "The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun.",
        "Massive solar flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so flare riders who had been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of the moment.",
        "Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding desert cracked along a deep faultline.",
        "A huge and hitherto undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of the world and back again.",
        "Those \u2013 very few \u2013 who witnessed the event and survived swear that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose into the air like a mile thick pancake, flipped itself over and fell back down.",
        "At that precise moment the solar radiation from the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and struck the ground.",
        "A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick with flowers.",
        "The structure of the atmosphere around the planet was subtly altered.",
        "The sun blazed less harshly in the summer, the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became a paradise.",
        "Even the telepathic power with which the people of Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force of the explosion.",
        "A spokesman for Disaster Area \u2013 the one who had had all the environmentalists shot \u2013 was later quoted as saying that it had been \u2018a good gig\u2019.",
        "Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music.",
        "A few sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a nearby region of space.",
        "22 Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it.",
        "Hangovers he\u2019d had, but never anything on this scale.",
        "This was it, this was the big one, this was the ultimate pits.",
        "Matter transference beams, he decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the head.",
        "Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought.",
        "The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the bother.",
        "On Earth \u2013 when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass \u2013 the problem had been with cars.",
        "The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm\u2019s way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another \u2013 particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i.e.",
        "covered with tar, full of smoke and short of fish.",
        "And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those atoms through the subetha, and then jamming them back together again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom for years had to be bad news.",
        "Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it.",
        "Here is one that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on Happi Werld III: Aldebaran\u2019s great, OK, Algol\u2019s pretty neat, Betelgeuse\u2019s pretty girls Will knock you off your feet.",
        "They\u2019ll do anything you like Real fast and then real slow, But if you have to take me apart to get me there Then I don\u2019t want to go.",
        "Singing, Take me apart, take me apart, What a way to roam, And if you have to take me apart to get me there I\u2019d rather stay at home.",
        "Sirius is paved with gold So I\u2019ve heard it said By nuts who then go on to say \u2018See Tau before you\u2019re dead.\u2019 I\u2019ll gladly take the high road Or even take the low, But if you have to take me apart to get me there Then I, for one, won\u2019t go.",
        "Singing, Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head, And if you try to take me apart to get me there I\u2019ll stay right here in bed.",
        "and so on.",
        "Another favourite song was much shorter: I teleported home one night With Ron and Sid and Meg.",
        "Ron stole Meggie\u2019s heart away And I got Sidney\u2019s leg.",
        "Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was still aware of a dull stomping throb.",
        "Slowly, carefully, he stood up.",
        "\u2018Can you hear a dull stomping throb?\u2019 said Ford Prefect.",
        "Arthur spun round and wobbled uncertainly.",
        "Ford Prefect was approaching looking red eyed and pasty.",
        "\u2018Where are we?\u2019 gasped Arthur.",
        "Ford looked around.",
        "They were standing in a long curving corridor which stretched out of sight in both directions.",
        "The outer steel wall \u2013 which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the inmates subdued \u2013 curved over the tops of their heads to where it met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered in dark brown hessian wall weave.",
        "The floor was of dark green ribbed rubber.",
        "Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the outer wall.",
        "It was several layers deep, yet through it he could see pinpoints of distant stars.",
        "\u2018I think we\u2019re in a spaceship of some kind,\u2019 he said.",
        "Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.",
        "\u2018Trillian?\u2019 called Arthur nervously.",
        "\u2018Zaphod?\u2019 Ford shrugged.",
        "\u2018Nowhere about,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve looked.",
        "They could be anywhere.",
        "An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any direction.",
        "Judging by the way I feel I should think we\u2019ve travelled a very long way indeed.\u2019 \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 \u2018Bad.\u2019 \u2018Do you think they\u2019re...\u2019 \u2018Where they are, how they are, there\u2019s no way we can\u2019t know and no way we can do anything about it.",
        "Do what I do.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t think about it.\u2019 Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away.",
        "He took a deep breath.",
        "\u2018Footsteps!\u2019 exclaimed Ford suddenly.",
        "\u2018Where?\u2019 \u2018That noise.",
        "That stomping throb.",
        "Pounding feet.",
        "Listen!\u2019 Arthur listened.",
        "The noise echoed round the corridor at them from an indeterminate distance.",
        "It was the muffled sound of pounding footsteps, and it was noticeably louder.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s move,\u2019 said Ford sharply.",
        "They both moved \u2013 in opposite directions.",
        "\u2018Not that way,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that\u2019s where they\u2019re coming from.\u2019 \u2018No it\u2019s not,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018they\u2019re coming from that way.\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re not, they\u2019re...\u2019 They both stopped.",
        "They both turned.",
        "They both listened intently.",
        "They both agreed with each other.",
        "They both set off in opposite directions again.",
        "Fear gripped them.",
        "From both directions the noise was getting louder.",
        "A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to the inner wall.",
        "They ran to it and hurried along it.",
        "It was dark, immensely long and, as they passed down it, gave them the impression that it was getting colder and colder.",
        "Other corridors gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.",
        "They stopped for a moment in alarm.",
        "The further down the corridor they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.",
        "They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened furiously.",
        "The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied feet was getting to them badly.",
        "Ford shivered, partly with cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of death ships, haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered such ships; stories of...",
        "Then Ford remembered the brown hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself together.",
        "However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you liked it wasn\u2019t with hessian wall weave.",
        "He grasped Arthur by the arm.",
        "\u2018Back the way we came,\u2019 he said firmly and they started to retrace their steps.",
        "A moment later they leapt like startled lizards down the nearest corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly hove into view directly in front of them.",
        "Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits, panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon gibber.",
        "Ford Prefect stared after them.",
        "\u2018Joggers!\u2019 he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up and down the network of corridors.",
        "\u2018Joggers?\u2019 whispered Arthur Dent.",
        "\u2018Joggers,\u2019 said Ford Prefect with a shrug.",
        "The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others.",
        "It was very short, and ended at a large steel door.",
        "Ford examined it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide.",
        "The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a coffin.",
        "And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety nine things that hit their eyes were also coffins.",
        "23 The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic.",
        "At the far end, about three hundred yards away, an archway let through to what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied.",
        "Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the floor of the vault.",
        "\u2018Wild,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s so great about dead people?\u2019 asked Arthur, nervously stepping down after him.",
        "\u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s find out, shall we?\u2019 On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like sarcophagi.",
        "They stood about waist high and were constructed of what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what it was \u2013 something that only appeared to be white marble.",
        "The tops were semi translucent, and through them could dimly be perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented occupants.",
        "They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles of whatever world it was they came from far behind them, but beyond that little else could be discerned.",
        "Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a heavy, oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered that it also froze his ankles.",
        "The sarcophagi too were intensely cold to the touch.",
        "Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them.",
        "He pulled a corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub furiously at something.",
        "\u2018Look, there\u2019s a plaque on this one,\u2019 he explained to Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s frosted over.\u2019 He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters.",
        "To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night out, but Ford instantly recognized an early form of Galactic Eezzeereed.",
        "\u2018It says \u201cGolgafrinchan Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone Sanitizer Second Class\u201d \u2013 and a serial number.\u2019 \u2018A telephone sanitizer?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018A dead telephone sanitizer?\u2019 \u2018Best kind.\u2019 \u2018But what\u2019s he doing here?\u2019 Ford peered through the top at the figure within.",
        "\u2018Not a lot,\u2019 he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of his which always made people think he\u2019d been overdoing things recently and should try to get some rest.",
        "He scampered over to another sarcophagus.",
        "A moment\u2019s brisk towel work and he announced: \u2018This one\u2019s a dead hairdresser.",
        "Hoopy!\u2019 The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained a second hand car salesman, third class.",
        "An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford\u2019s attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him.",
        "A thought occurred to Arthur.",
        "\u2018If these are just coffins,\u2019 he said, \u2018why are they kept so cold?\u2019 \u2018Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway?\u2019 said Ford tugging the hatchway open.",
        "The gas poured down through it.",
        "\u2018Why in fact is anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five thousand dead bodies through space?\u2019 \u2018Ten thousand,\u2019 said Arthur, pointing at the archway through which the next chamber was dimly visible.",
        "Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway.",
        "He looked up again.",
        "\u2018Fifteen thousand,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s another lot down there.\u2019 \u2018Fifteen million,\u2019 said a voice.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s a lot,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018A lot a lot.\u2019 \u2018Turn around slowly,\u2019 barked the voice, \u2018and put your hands up.",
        "Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits.\u2019 \u2018Hello?\u2019 said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up and not making any other move.",
        "\u2018Why,\u2019 said Arthur Dent, \u2018isn\u2019t anyone ever pleased to see us?\u2019 Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had entered the vault was the man who wasn\u2019t pleased to see them.",
        "His displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he waved a long silver Kill O Zap gun at them.",
        "The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush.",
        "\u2018Make it evil,\u2019 he\u2019d been told.",
        "\u2018Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end.",
        "Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them.",
        "If that means sticking all sorts of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it.",
        "This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with.\u2019 Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.",
        "The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them.",
        "As he came into the light they could see his black and gold uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching motorist flash his lights in annoyance.",
        "He gestured at the door.",
        "\u2018Out,\u2019 he said.",
        "People who can supply that amount of fire power don\u2019t need to supply verbs as well.",
        "Ford and Arthur went out, closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill O Zap gun and the buttons.",
        "Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty four oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past them into the vault.",
        "Arthur turned to watch them in confusion.",
        "\u2018Move!\u2019 screamed their captor.",
        "Arthur moved.",
        "Ford shrugged and moved.",
        "In the vault the joggers went to twenty four empty sarcophagi along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into twenty four dreamless sleeps.",
        "24 \u2018Er, Captain...\u2019 \u2018Yes, Number One?\u2019 \u2018Just had a sort of report thingy from Number Two.\u2019 \u2018Oh dear.\u2019 High up in the bridge of the ship, the captain stared out into the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation.",
        "From where he reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and above him the vast panorama of stars through which they were moving \u2013 a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the course of the voyage.",
        "Turning and looking backwards, over the vast two mile bulk of the ship, he could see the far denser mass of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band.",
        "This was the view through the galactic centre from which they were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a speed that he couldn\u2019t quite remember at the moment, but he knew it was terribly fast.",
        "It was something approaching the speed of something or other, or was it three times the speed of something else? Jolly impressive, anyway.",
        "He peered into the bright distance behind the ship, looking for something.",
        "He did this every few minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for.",
        "He didn\u2019t let it worry him, though.",
        "The scientist chaps had been very insistent that everything was going to be perfectly all right providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit in an orderly fashion.",
        "He wasn\u2019t panicking.",
        "As far as he was concerned everything was going splendidly.",
        "He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy sponge.",
        "It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly irritated about something.",
        "Now what was all that about? A slight cough alerted him to the fact that the ship\u2019s first officer was still standing nearby.",
        "Nice chap, Number One.",
        "Not of the very brightest, had the odd spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good officer material for all that.",
        "The captain wasn\u2019t a man to kick a chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces, however long it took him.",
        "Not like that ghastly Number Two, strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons, issuing reports every hour: \u2018Ship\u2019s still moving, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Still on course, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Oxygen levels still being maintained, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Give it a miss,\u2019 was the captain\u2019s vote.",
        "Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him.",
        "He peered down at Number One.",
        "\u2018Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having found some prisoners...\u2019 The captain thought about this.",
        "Seemed pretty unlikely to him, but he wasn\u2019t one to stand in his officers\u2019 way.",
        "\u2018Well, perhaps that\u2019ll keep him happy for a bit,\u2019 he said, \u2018he\u2019s always wanted some.\u2019 Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship\u2019s apparently endless corridors.",
        "Number Two marched behind them barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or trying any funny stuff.",
        "They seemed to have passed at least a mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave.",
        "Finally they reached a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it.",
        "They entered.",
        "To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable thing about the ship\u2019s bridge was not the fifty foot diameter hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the dazzling display of stars shone down on them; to people who have eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders are commonplace.",
        "Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments that crowded the long circumferential wall around them.",
        "To Arthur this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it confirmed his supicions that Disaster Area\u2019s stuntship had taken them back at least a million, if not two million, years before their own time.",
        "No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.",
        "The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings.",
        "An intestinal jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.",
        "As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this that Number Two approached it.",
        "\u2018Captain, sir!\u2019 he shouted through clenched teeth \u2013 a difficult trick but he\u2019d had years during which to perfect it.",
        "A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above the rim of the monstrous bath.",
        "\u2018Ah, hello, Number Two,\u2019 said the captain, waving a cheery sponge, \u2018having a nice day?\u2019 Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.",
        "\u2018I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven, sir!\u2019 he yapped.",
        "Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion.",
        "\u2018Er...",
        "hello,\u2019 they said.",
        "The captain beamed at them.",
        "So Number Two had really found some prisoners.",
        "Well, good for him, thought the captain, nice to see a chap doing what he\u2019s best at.",
        "\u2018Oh, hello there,\u2019 he said to them.",
        "\u2018Excuse me not getting up, just having a quick bath.",
        "Well, jynnan tonnyx all round, then.",
        "Look in the fridge, Number One.\u2019 \u2018Certainly, sir.\u2019 It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how much importance to attach, that something like 85 per cent of all known worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee N\u2019N T\u2019N ix, or jinond o nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on the same phonetic theme.",
        "The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian \u2018chinanto/ mnigs\u2019, which is ordinary water served at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan \u2018tzjin anthony ks\u2019, which kills cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds.",
        "What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation.",
        "As far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is right off the graph, and yet it persists.",
        "Old structural linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on about it.",
        "Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to something of profound importance, and end up becoming old structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with the young ones.",
        "Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend too many nights drowning their problems in ouisghian zodahs.",
        "Number Two stood before the captain\u2019s bathtub trembling with frustration.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t you want to interrogate the prisoners, sir?\u2019 he squealed.",
        "The captain peered at him in bemusement.",
        "\u2018Why on Golgafrinchan should I want to do that?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u2018To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came here!\u2019 \u2018Oh no, no, no,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018I expect they just dropped in for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018But sir, they\u2019re my prisoners! I must interrogate them!\u2019 The captain looked at them doubtfully.",
        "\u2018Oh all right,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you must.",
        "Ask them what they want to drink.\u2019 A hard cold gleam came into Number Two\u2019s eyes.",
        "He advanced slowly on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.",
        "\u2018All right, you scum,\u2019 he growled, \u2018you vermin...\u2019 He jabbed Ford with the Kill O Zap gun.",
        "\u2018Steady on, Number Two,\u2019 admonished the captain gently.",
        "\u2018What do you want to drink!!!\u2019 Number Two screamed.",
        "\u2018Well, the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018What about you, Arthur?\u2019 Arthur blinked.",
        "\u2018What? Oh, er, yes,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018With ice or without?\u2019 bellowed Number Two.",
        "\u2018Oh, with, please,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Lemon??!!\u2019 \u2018Yes, please,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018and do you have any of those little biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m asking the questions!!!!\u2019 howled Number Two, his body quaking with apoplectic fury.",
        "\u2018Er, Number Two...\u2019 said the captain softly.",
        "\u2018Sir?!\u2019 \u2018Push off, would you, there\u2019s a good chap.",
        "I\u2019m trying to have a relaxing bath.\u2019 Number Two\u2019s eyes narrowed and became what are known in the Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake.",
        "Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.",
        "He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two\u2019s) mouth a thin hard line.",
        "Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting behaviour.",
        "If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering fangs.",
        "\u2018May I remind you, sir,\u2019 hissed Number Two at the captain, \u2018that you have now been in that bath for over three years?!\u2019 This final shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror.",
        "The captain squirmed in his bath.",
        "He gave Ford Prefect a lame smile.",
        "\u2018Well, you need to relax a lot in a job like mine,\u2019 he said.",
        "Ford slowly lowered his hands.",
        "It provoked no reaction.",

        "It was safe.",
        "\u2018Er...\u2019 he said to the captain.",
        "\u2018Yes?\u2019 said the captain.",
        "\u2018I wonder,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018could I ask you actually what your job is, in fact?\u2019 A hand tapped him on the shoulder.",
        "He spun round.",
        "It was the first officer.",
        "\u2018Your drinks,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Ah, thank you,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He and Arthur took their jynnan tonnyx.",
        "Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it tasted very like a whisky and soda.",
        "\u2018I mean, I couldn\u2019t help noticing,\u2019 said Ford, also taking a sip, \u2018the bodies.",
        "In the hold.\u2019 \u2018Bodies?\u2019 said the captain in surprise.",
        "Ford paused and thought to himself.",
        "Never take anything for granted, he thought.",
        "Could it be that the captain doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship? The captain was nodding cheerfully at him.",
        "He also appeared to be playing with a rubber duck.",
        "Ford looked around.",
        "Number Two was staring at him in the mirror, but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move.",
        "The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray and smiling benignly.",
        "\u2018Bodies?\u2019 said the captain again.",
        "Ford licked his lips.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018All those dead telephone sanitizers and account executives, you know, down in the hold.\u2019 The captain stared at him.",
        "Suddenly he threw back his head and laughed.",
        "\u2018Oh they\u2019re not dead,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Good Lord, no, no they\u2019re frozen.",
        "They\u2019re going to be revived.\u2019 Ford did something he very rarely did.",
        "He blinked.",
        "Arthur seemed to come out of a trance.",
        "\u2018You mean you\u2019ve got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018millions of them.",
        "Hair dressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, management consultants, you name it.",
        "We\u2019re going to colonize another planet.\u2019 Ford wobbled very slightly.",
        "\u2018Exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said the captain.",
        "\u2018What, with that lot?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Ah, now don\u2019t misunderstand me,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018we\u2019re just one of the ships in the Ark Fleet.",
        "We\u2019re the \u201cB\u201d Ark you see.",
        "Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?\u2019 Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around the bath.",
        "The captain let out a sigh of pleasure.",
        "\u2018Thank you so much, my dear fellow.",
        "Do help yourselves to more drinks, of course.\u2019 Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first officer\u2019s tray and refilled his glass to the top.",
        "\u2018What,\u2019 he said, \u2018is a \u201cB\u201d Ark?\u2019 \u2018This is,\u2019 said the captain, and swished the foamy water around joyfully with the duck.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but...\u2019 \u2018Well, what happened you see was,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018our planet, the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed.\u2019 \u2018Doomed?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes.",
        "So what everyone thought was, let\u2019s pack the whole population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on another planet.\u2019 Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a satisfied grunt.",
        "\u2018You mean a less doomed one?\u2019 prompted Arthur.",
        "\u2018What did you say, dear fellow?\u2019 \u2018A less doomed planet.",
        "You were going to settle on.\u2019 \u2018Are going to settle on, yes.",
        "So it was decided to build three ships, you see, three Arks in space, and...",
        "I\u2019m not boring you, am I?\u2019 \u2018No, no,\u2019 said Ford firmly, \u2018it\u2019s fascinating.\u2019 \u2018You know, it\u2019s delightful,\u2019 reflected the captain, \u2018to have someone else to talk to for a change.\u2019 Number Two\u2019s eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly distracted from their favourite piece of month old meat.",
        "\u2018Trouble with a long journey like this,\u2019 continued the captain, \u2018is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets terribly boring because half the time you know what you\u2019re going to say next.\u2019 \u2018Only half the time?\u2019 asked Arthur in surprise.",
        "The captain thought for a moment.",
        "\u2018Yes, about half I\u2019d say.",
        "Anyway \u2013 where\u2019s the soap?\u2019 He fished around and found it.",
        "\u2018Yes, so anyway,\u2019 he resumed, \u2018the idea was that into the first ship, the \u201cA\u201d ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers; and then into the third, or \u201cC\u201d ship, would go all the people who did the actual work, who made things and did things; and then into the \u201cB\u201d ship \u2013 that\u2019s us \u2013 would go everyone else, the middlemen, you see.\u2019 He smiled happily at them.",
        "\u2018And we were sent off first,\u2019 he concluded, and hummed a little bathing tune.",
        "The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one of his world\u2019s most exciting and prolific jingle writers (who was currently asleep in hold thirty six some nine hundred yards behind them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward moment of silence.",
        "Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and furiously avoided each other\u2019s eyes.",
        "\u2018Er...\u2019 said Arthur after a moment, \u2018what exactly was it that was wrong with your planet, then?\u2019 \u2018Oh, it was doomed, as I said,\u2019 said the captain.",
        "\u2018Apparently it was going to crash into the sun or something.",
        "Or maybe it was that the moon was going to crash into us.",
        "Something of the kind.",
        "Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the first officer suddenly, \u2018I thought it was that the planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot piranha bees.",
        "Wasn\u2019t that it?\u2019 Number Two spun around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that only comes with the amount of practice he was prepared to put in.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s not what I was told!\u2019 he hissed.",
        "\u2018My commanding officer told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!\u2019 \u2018Oh really...\u2019 said Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans, claws that could tear continents from their roots, a thousand eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles across, a monster such as you have never...",
        "never...",
        "ever...\u2019 \u2018And they made sure they sent your lot off first, did they?\u2019 enquired Arthur.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018well, everyone said, very nicely, I thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good haircut and where the phones were clean.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 agreed Ford, \u2018I can see that would be very important.",
        "And the other ships, er...",
        "they followed on after you, did they?\u2019 For a moment the captain did not answer.",
        "He twisted round in his bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards the bright galactic centre.",
        "He squinted into the inconceivable distance.",
        "Well it\u2019s funny you should say that,\u2019 he said and allowed himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, \u2018because curiously enough we haven\u2019t heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago...",
        "but they must be behind us somewhere.\u2019 He peered off into the distance again.",
        "Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.",
        "\u2018Unless, of course,\u2019 he said softly, \u2018they were eaten by the goat...\u2019 \u2018Ah yes...\u2019 said the captain, with a slight hesitancy creeping into his voice, \u2018the goat...\u2019 His eyes passed over the solid shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge.",
        "They winked away innocently at him.",
        "He stared out at the stars, but none of them said a word.",
        "He glanced at his first and second officers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a moment.",
        "He glanced at Ford Prefect, who raised his eyebrows at him.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a funny thing, you know,\u2019 said the captain at last, \u2018but now that I actually come to tell the story to someone else...",
        "I mean does it strike you as odd, Number One?\u2019 \u2018Errrrrrrrrrrr...\u2019 said Number One.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I can see that you\u2019ve got a lot of things you\u2019re going to want to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet...\u2019 \u2018Ah, well that\u2019s a little difficult, you see,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left Golgafrinchan, I think partly because I\u2019m not very good with figures...\u2019 \u2018You mean we\u2019re stuck here on this ship?\u2019 exclaimed Ford, suddenly losing patience with the whole charade.",
        "\u2018When are you meant to be reaching this planet you\u2019re meant to be colonizing?\u2019 \u2018Oh, we\u2019re nearly there, I think,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018any second now.",
        "It\u2019s probably time I was getting out of this bath, in fact.",
        "Oh, I don\u2019t know though, why stop just when I\u2019m enjoying it?\u2019 \u2018So we\u2019re actually going to land in a minute?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no...",
        "er...\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 asked Ford sharply.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said the captain, picking his way through the words carefully, \u2018I think as far as I can remember we were programmed to crash on it.\u2019 \u2018Crash?\u2019 shouted Ford and Arthur.",
        "\u2018Er, yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018yes, it\u2019s all part of the plan, I think.",
        "There was a terribly good reason for it which I can\u2019t quite remember at the moment.",
        "It was something to do with...",
        "er...\u2019 Ford exploded.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re a load of useless bloodly loonies!\u2019 he shouted.",
        "\u2018Ah yes, that was it,\u2019 beamed the captain, \u2018that was the reason.\u2019 25 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, has this to say about the planet of Golgafrinchan: it is a planet with an ancient and mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green, with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musky lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows and intoxicated imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens; a land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and of the spirit.",
        "This was its history.",
        "And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the Great Circling Poets of Arium.",
        "These Circling Poets used to live in remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at them.",
        "And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn\u2019t they go away and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people with all this rock throwing business, they would suddenly stop, and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety four great Song Cycles of Vassillian.",
        "These songs were all of extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all fell into exactly the same pattern.",
        "The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the city of Vassillian a party of five sage princes and four horses.",
        "The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fight giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished.",
        "The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back.",
        "All this lay in the planet\u2019s remote past.",
        "It was, however, a descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of Golgafrinchan to rid themselves of an entire useless third of their population.",
        "The other two thirds stayed firmly at home and lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone.",
        "26 That night the ship crash landed on an utterly insignificant little blue green planet which circled a small unregarded yellow sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy.",
        "In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from their pre ordained flight path.",
        "It had quickly become apparent to him that the ship had been programmed to convey its pay load safely, if uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself beyond all hope of repair in the process.",
        "Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and offload its deep frozen and unwanted cargo, for the ship began to settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the stagnant slime.",
        "Once or twice during the night it was starkly silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors \u2013 the detritus of its descent \u2013 flashed across the sky.",
        "In the grey pre dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle and sank for ever into the stinking depths.",
        "When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing their way desperately to dry land.",
        "A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures.",
        "Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship, but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid ground on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal.",
        "Two figures moved further afield.",
        "From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the horror of which they could not feel a part.",
        "\u2018Filthy dirty trick to pull,\u2019 muttered Arthur.",
        "Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged.",
        "\u2018An imaginative solution to a problem, I\u2019d have thought,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Why can\u2019t people just learn to live together in peace and harmony?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh.",
        "\u2018Forty two!\u2019 he said with a malicious grin.",
        "\u2018No, doesn\u2019t work.",
        "Never mind.\u2019 Arthur looked at him as if he\u2019d gone mad and, seeing nothing to indicate to the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.",
        "\u2018What do you think will happen to them all?\u2019 he said after a while.",
        "\u2018In an infinite Universe anything can happen,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018Even survival.",
        "Strange but true.\u2019 A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the landscape and then settled again on the scene of misery below them.",
        "\u2018I think they\u2019ll manage for a while,\u2019 he said.",
        "Arthur looked up sharply.",
        "\u2018Why do you say that?\u2019 he said.",
        "Ford shrugged.",
        "\u2018Just a hunch,\u2019 he said, and refused to be drawn on any further questions.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 he said suddenly.",
        "Arthur followed his pointing finger.",
        "Down amongst the sprawling masses a figure was moving \u2013 or perhaps lurching would be a more accurate description.",
        "He appeared to be carrying something on his shoulder.",
        "As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken fashion.",
        "After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a heap.",
        "Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him.",
        "\u2018Movie camera,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Recording the historic moment.",
        "\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know about you,\u2019 said Ford again after a moment, \u2018but I\u2019m off.\u2019 He sat a while in silence.",
        "After a while this seemed to require comment.",
        "\u2018Er, when you say you\u2019re off, what do you mean exactly?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Good question,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m getting total silence.\u2019 Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with knobs on a small black box.",
        "Ford had already introduced this box to Arthur as a Sub Etha Sens O Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and not pursued the matter.",
        "In his mind the Universe still divided into two parts \u2013 the Earth, and everything else.",
        "The Earth having been demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass meant that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact with his home.",
        "Sub Etha Sens O Matics belonged firmly in the \u2018everything else\u2019 category.",

        "To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.",

        "And somewhere in the shadows behind them \u2013 who? Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to? 29 On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in particular \u2013 nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six men in this galaxy have a key \u2013 it was raining.",
        "It was bucketing down, and had been for hours.",
        "It beat the top of the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath.",
        "The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby land.",
        "It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the shack down to the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of interesting shells which had been placed there.",
        "The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening within, but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose attention was otherwise engaged.",
        "He was a tall shambling man with rough straw coloured hair that was damp from the leaking roof.",
        "His clothes were shabby, his back was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed.",
        "In his shack was an old beaten up armchair, an old scratched table, an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small but warm.",
        "There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this was currently the focus of the man\u2019s attention.",
        "He bent his shambling form over it.",

        "pussy want it?\u2019 The cat seemed undecided on the matter.",

        "Doubt crept into his voice.",

        "\u2018I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who am I to judge?\u2019 He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his seat.",
        "\u2018Ah, I seem to see you eating it,\u2019 he said at last, as the cat exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust and pounced on to the fish.",
        "\u2018I like it when I see you eat fish,\u2019 said the man, \u2018because in my mind you will waste away if you don\u2019t.\u2019 He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a pencil.",
        "He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and experimented with the different ways of bringing them together.",
        "He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper, then next to the paper.",
        "He tried wrapping the paper round the pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil against the paper.",

        "He picked up another piece of paper from the table.",
        "This had a crossword on it.",
        "He studied it briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest.",

        "Or so I imagine I\u2019m told.",
        "When the men come, or when in my mind the men come in their six black shiny ships, do they come in your mind too? What do you see, pussy?\u2019 He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these speculations.",
        "\u2018And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they\u2019re singing songs to you.\u2019 He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the supposition.",
        "\u2018Perhaps they are singing songs to you,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I just think they\u2019re asking me questions.\u2019 He paused again.",

        "\u2018Do you think they came today?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I do.",
        "There\u2019s mud on the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate for you and a memory of them in my mind.",
        "Hardly conclusive evidence, I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial.",
        "And look what else they\u2019ve left me.\u2019 He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it.",
        "\u2018Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator.\u2019 He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to sleep and the rain outside continued to pour.",
        "Eventually he put the calculator aside.",
        "\u2018I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018To come all that way and leave all these things just for the privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange behaviour.",
        "Or so it seems to me.",
        "Who can tell, who can tell.\u2019 From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill from the stove.",
        "He inhaled deeply and sat back.",

        "\u2018A big white one.",
        "I\u2019ve never seen a big white one, just the six black ones.",
        "And the six green ones.",

        "Never a big white one.",

        "Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky.",
        "Yes, that seems more likely.\u2019 He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by his mattress.",
        "He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle.",
        "He sat again.",
        "\u2018Perhaps some other people are coming to see me,\u2019 he said.",
        "A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the Heart of Gold.",
        "Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into themselves to keep the rain off their faces.",
        "\u2018In there?\u2019 shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Zarniwoop.",
        "\u2018That shack?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Weird,\u2019 said Zaphod.",

        "If you find warmth makes you dry, you\u2019d better come in.\u2019 They went in.",

        "Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name.\u2019 He invited Trillian to sit in the chair.",

        "The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair.",
        "After a while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on the other.",
        "Various noises continued outside, but he didn\u2019t know whether they were real or not.",
        "He then talked to his table for a week to see how it would react.",
        "30 The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and clarity.",
        "Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any means of judging and finally stopped to rest.",
        "The night was cool and balmy, the air pure, the Sub Etha Sens O Matic totally silent.",
        "A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their jangled spirits.",
        "Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this was the most beautiful he had ever seen.",
        "All that day they had passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees, the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and Ford Prefect had checked his Sub Etha Sens O Matic at less and less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less annoyance at its continued silence.",
        "He was beginning to think he liked it here.",
        "Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall feeling refreshed but hungry.",
        "Ford had stuffed some small rolls into his satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off these before moving on.",
        "So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore this world they should have some clear idea of where they had come from and where they were going.",
        "Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them.",
        "It vanished at the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not alarmed.",
        "Half an hour later they glimsped another such face, and ten minutes after that another.",
        "A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped short.",
        "Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about two dozen men and women.",
        "They stood still and quiet facing Ford and Arthur.",
        "Around some of the women huddled some small children and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings made of mud and branches.",
        "Ford and Arthur held their breath.",
        "The tallest of the men stood little over five feet high, they all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently at the strangers.",
        "Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly.",
        "For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither side making any move.",
        "The natives seemed puzzled by the intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were quite clearly not issuing any invitations.",
        "Nothing happened.",
        "For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.",
        "After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.",
        "\u2018Hello,\u2019 he said.",
        "The women drew their children slightly closer to them.",
        "The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome \u2013 it was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome.",
        "One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader, stepped forward.",
        "His face was quiet and calm, almost serene.",
        "\u2018Ugghhhuugghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh,\u2019 he said quietly.",
        "This caught Arthur by surprise.",
        "He had grown so used to receiving an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he heard via the Babel fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by the fact that it didn\u2019t seem to be working.",
        "Vague shadows of meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was nothing he could get any firm grasp on.",
        "He guessed, correctly as it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the barest rudiments of language, and that the Babel fish was therefore powerless to help.",
        "He glanced at Ford, who was infinitely more experienced in these matters.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, \u2018he\u2019s asking us if we\u2019d mind walking on round the edge of the village.\u2019 A moment later, a gesture from the man creature seemed to confirm this.",
        "\u2018Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug,\u2019 continued the man creature.",
        "\u2018The general gist,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018as far as I can make out, is that we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if we would walk round his village rather than through it it would make them all very happy.\u2019 \u2018So what do we do?\u2019 \u2018I think we make them happy,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the clearing.",
        "This seemed to go down very well with the natives who bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business.",
        "Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood.",
        "A few hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small pile of fruit lying in their path \u2013 berries that looked remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.",
        "So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had seen, though the trees and bushes were laden with them.",
        "\u2018Look at it this way,\u2019 Ford Prefect had said, \u2018fruit and berries on strange planets either make you live or make you die.",
        "Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when you\u2019re going to die if you don\u2019t.",
        "That way you stay ahead.",
        "The secret of healthy hitchhiking is to eat junk food.\u2019 They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion.",
        "It looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger.",
        "\u2018Look at it this way,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018er...\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get to eat it,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "The leaf dappled sun gleamed on the plump skins of the things which looked like pears.",
        "The things which looked like raspberries and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever seen, even in ice cream commercials.",
        "\u2018Why don\u2019t we eat them and think about it afterwards?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Maybe that\u2019s what they want us to do.\u2019 \u2018All right, look at it this way...\u2019 \u2018Sounds good so far.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s there for us to eat.",
        "Either it\u2019s good or it\u2019s bad, either they want to feed us or to poison us.",
        "If it\u2019s poisonous and we don\u2019t eat it they\u2019ll just attack us some other way.",
        "If we don\u2019t eat, we lose out either way.\u2019 \u2018I like the way you\u2019re thinking,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Now eat one.\u2019 Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of the things that looked like pears.",
        "\u2018I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Eh?\u2019 \u2018Garden of Eden.",
        "Tree.",
        "Apple.",
        "That bit, remember?\u2019 \u2018Yes of course I do.\u2019 \u2018Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and says, \u201cDo what you like guys, oh, but don\u2019t eat the apple.\u201d Surprise surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush shouting \u201cGotcha.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have made any difference if they hadn\u2019t eaten it.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018Because if you\u2019re dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won\u2019t give up.",
        "They\u2019ll get you in the end.\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018Never mind, eat the fruit.\u2019 \u2018You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden.\u2019 \u2018Eat the fruit.\u2019 \u2018Sounds quite like it too.\u2019 Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a pear,\u2019 he said.",
        "A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect turned round and called out.",
        "\u2018Thank you.",
        "Thank you very much,\u2019 he called, \u2018you\u2019re very kind.\u2019 They went on their way.",
        "For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact.",
        "They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear that they were grateful simply to be left alone.",
        "The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was where the sea started.",
        "Having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and crossed the sea.",
        "It was relatively calm, only about sixty miles wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left.",
        "Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and isolation by deciding to ignore them.",
        "When the craving for company became too great they would know where to find it, but for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans were hundreds of miles behind them.",
        "Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub Etha Sens O Matic more often again.",
        "Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was so faint and from such an enormous distance that it depressed him more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.",
        "On a whim they turned northwards.",
        "After weeks of travelling they came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it.",
        "This time it was harder going, the climate was getting colder.",
        "Arthur suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect \u2013 the increasing difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose that was otherwise lacking.",
        "He strode onwards relentlessly.",
        "Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty.",
        "The vast, jagged, snow covered peaks ravished their senses.",
        "The cold began to bite into their bones.",
        "They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of ex Pralite monks running a Mind Surfing resort in the Hills of Hunian.",
        "The Galaxy is littered with ex Pralite monks, all on the make, because the mental control techniques the Order has evolved as a form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational \u2013 and extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they have finished their devotional training and just before they take their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives.",
        "Ford\u2019s technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a while and smiling.",
        "After a while an animal \u2013 a deer perhaps \u2013 would appear from out of the trees and watch him cautiously.",
        "Ford would continue to smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to embrace all of creation.",
        "A wonderful quietness would descend on the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from this transfigured man.",
        "Slowly the deer would approach, step by step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect would reach out to it and break its neck.",
        "\u2018Pheromone control,\u2019 he said it was, \u2018you just have to know how to generate the right smell.\u2019 31 A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south west to the north east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice \u2013 fjords.",
        "For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks and glaciers, awe struck with beauty.",
        "\u2018Arthur!\u2019 yelled Ford suddenly.",
        "It was the afternoon of the second day.",
        "Arthur was sitting on a high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the craggy promontories.",
        "\u2018Arthur!\u2019 yelled Ford again.",
        "Arthur looked to where Ford\u2019s voice had come from, carried faintly in the wind.",
        "Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there crouching by the solid wall of blue ice.",
        "He was tense with excitement \u2013 his eyes darted up to meet Arthur\u2019s.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018look!\u2019 Arthur looked.",
        "He saw the solid wall of blue ice.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s a glacier.",
        "I\u2019ve already seen it.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018you\u2019ve looked at it, you haven\u2019t seen it.",
        "Look.\u2019 Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.",
        "Arthur peered \u2013 he saw nothing but vague shadows.",
        "\u2018Move back from it,\u2019 insisted Ford, \u2018look again.\u2019 Arthur moved back and looked again.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said, and shrugged.",
        "\u2018What am I supposed to be looking for?\u2019 And suddenly he saw it.",
        "\u2018You see it?\u2019 He saw it.",
        "His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn\u2019t got anything to say yet and shut it again.",
        "His brain then started to contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again.",
        "Once more gathering up the jaw, his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered around in an aimless fashion.",
        "For a second or so the brain tried to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice, which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully to the ground.",
        "The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the surface.",
        "Looked at from the right angle they resolved into the solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three feet high; and for those, like Arthur, who couldn\u2019t read Magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face hanging in the ice.",
        "It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind.",
        "It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.",
        "32 A thin whine filled the air.",
        "It whirled and howled through the trees upsetting the squirrels.",
        "A few birds flew off in disgust.",
        "The noise danced and skittered round the clearing.",
        "It whooped, it rasped, it generally offended.",
        "The captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an indulgent eye.",
        "Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to find his new life remarkably congenial.",
        "A hollow had been scooped out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing, and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water over him.",
        "Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they hadn\u2019t yet worked out a way of heating it.",
        "Never mind, that would come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine \u2013 perfection.",
        "To those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn\u2019t found in mines, the captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had been reluctantly acknowledged.",
        "No, life was very pleasant, and the great thing about it was that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be more pleasant still.",
        "It was very important to have things to look forward to.",
        "Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes, increasing the captain\u2019s already considerable pleasure at the thought that any moment now they might stop.",
        "That was something he looked forward to as well.",
        "What else was pleasant? he asked himself.",
        "Well, so many things: the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching; the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock hewn bath.",
        "The only thing nicer than a phone that didn\u2019t ring all the time (or indeed at all) was six phones that didn\u2019t ring all the time (or indeed at all).",
        "Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the afternoon committee meeting.",
        "The captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak.",
        "The afternoon committee meetings were his favourite.",
        "Other eyes watched the assembling crowds.",
        "High in a tree on the edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from foreign climes.",
        "After his six month journey he was lean and healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer skin coat; his beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country rock singer\u2019s.",
        "He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for almost a week now, and Ford had decided it was time to stir things up a bit.",
        "The clearing was now full.",
        "Hundreds of men and women lounged around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally having a fairly relaxed time of it.",
        "Their track suits were now all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled hair.",
        "Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be some form of insulation against the coming winter.",
        "Ford\u2019s eyes narrowed.",
        "They couldn\u2019t be interested in botany of a sudden, could they? In the middle of these speculations the captain\u2019s voice rose above the hubbub.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019d like to call this meeting to some sort of order if that\u2019s at all possible.",
        "Is that all right with everybody?\u2019 He smiled genially.",
        "\u2018In a minute.",
        "When you\u2019re all ready.\u2019 The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent, except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and uninhabitable musical world of his own.",
        "A few of those in his immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him.",
        "If there was any reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.",
        "A small group of people had clustered round the captain and one of them was clearly preparing to speak.",
        "He did this by standing up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a minute.",
        "The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on him.",
        "A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right dramatic moment to make his entry.",
        "The man turned to speak.",
        "Ford dropped down out of the tree.",
        "\u2018Hi there,\u2019 he said.",
        "The crowd swivelled round.",
        "\u2018Ah, my dear fellow,\u2019 called out the captain.",
        "\u2018Got any matches on you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, sounding a little deflated.",
        "It wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d prepared.",
        "He decided he\u2019d better be a little stronger on the subject.",
        "\u2018No I haven\u2019t,\u2019 he continued.",
        "\u2018No matches.",
        "Instead I bring you news...\u2019 \u2018Pity,\u2019 said the captain.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve all run out, you see.",
        "Haven\u2019t had a hot bath in weeks.\u2019 Ford refused to be headed off.",
        "\u2018I bring you news,\u2019 he said, \u2018of a discovery that might interest you.\u2019 \u2018Is it on the agenda?\u2019 snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.",
        "Ford smiled a broad country rock singer smile.",
        "\u2018Now, come on,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Well I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said the man huffily, \u2018but speaking as a management consultant of many years\u2019 standing, I must insist on the importance of observing the committee structure.\u2019 Ford looked round the crowd.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s mad, you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018this is a prehistoric planet.\u2019 \u2018Address the chair!\u2019 snapped the management consultant.",
        "\u2018There isn\u2019t a chair,\u2019 explained Ford, \u2018there\u2019s only a rock.\u2019 The management consultant decided that testiness was what the situation now called for.",
        "\u2018Well, call it a chair,\u2019 he said testily.",
        "\u2018Why not call it a rock?\u2019 asked Ford.",
        "\u2018You obviously have no conception,\u2019 said the management consultant, now abandoning testiness in favour of good old fashioned hauteur, \u2018of modern business methods.\u2019 \u2018And you have no conception of where you are,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.",
        "\u2018Shut up, you two,\u2019 she said, \u2018I want to table a motion.\u2019 \u2018You mean boulder a motion,\u2019 tittered a hairdresser.",
        "\u2018Order, order!\u2019 yapped the management consultant.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018let\u2019s see how you\u2019re doing.\u2019 He plonked himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his temper.",
        "The captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.",
        "\u2018I would like to call to order,\u2019 he said pleasantly, \u2018the five hundred and seventy third meeting of the colonization committee of Fintlewoodlewix...\u2019 Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.",
        "\u2018This is futile,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018five hundred and seventy three committee meetings and you haven\u2019t even discovered fire yet!\u2019 \u2018If you would care,\u2019 said the girl with the strident voice, \u2018to examine the agenda sheet...\u2019 \u2018Agenda rock,\u2019 trilled the hairdresser happily.",
        "\u2018Thank you, I\u2019ve made that point,\u2019 muttered Ford.",
        "you...",
        "will...",
        "see...\u2019 continued the girl firmly, \u2018that we are having a report from the Hairdressers\u2019 Fire Development Sub Committee today.\u2019 \u2018Oh...",
        "ah \u2013 \u2019 said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning, \u2018Er, will next Tuesday do?\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, rounding on him, \u2018what have you done? What are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?\u2019 \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said the hairdresser.",
        "\u2018All they gave me was a couple of sticks...\u2019 \u2018So what have you done with them?\u2019 Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford.",
        "Ford held them up for all to see.",
        "\u2018Curling tongs,\u2019 he said.",
        "The crowd applauded.",
        "\u2018Never mind,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Rome wasn\u2019t burnt in a day.\u2019 The crowd hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what he was talking about, but they loved it nevertheless.",
        "They applauded.",
        "\u2018Well, you\u2019re obviously being totally naive, of course,\u2019 said the girl.",
        "\u2018When you\u2019ve been in marketing as long as I have you\u2019ll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched.",
        "We\u2019ve got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them.\u2019 The crowd were tense.",
        "They were expecting something wonderful from Ford.",
        "\u2018Stick it up your nose,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,\u2019 insisted the girl.",
        "\u2018Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?\u2019 \u2018Do you?\u2019 Ford asked the crowd.",
        "\u2018Yes!\u2019 shouted some.",
        "\u2018No!\u2019 shouted others happily.",
        "They didn\u2019t know, they just thought it was great.",
        "\u2018And the wheel,\u2019 said the captain.",
        "\u2018What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said the marketing girl, \u2018well, we\u2019re having a little difficulty there.\u2019 \u2018Difficulty?\u2019 exclaimed Ford.",
        "\u2018Difficulty? What do you mean, difficulty? It\u2019s the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!\u2019 The marketing girl soured him with a look.",
        "\u2018All right, Mr Wiseguy,\u2019 she said, \u2018you\u2019re so clever, you tell us what colour it should be.\u2019 The crowd went wild.",
        "One up to the home team, they thought.",
        "Ford shrugged his shoulders and sat down again.",
        "\u2018Almighty Zarquon,\u2019 he said, \u2018have none of you done anything?\u2019 As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of noise from the entrance to the clearing.",
        "The crowd couldn\u2019t believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their Golgafrinchan 3rd Regiment dress uniforms.",
        "About half of them still carried Kill O Zap guns, the rest now carried spears which they struck together as they marched.",
        "They looked bronzed, healthy and utterly exhausted and bedraggled.",
        "They clattered to a halt and banged to attention.",
        "One of them fell over and never moved again.",
        "\u2018Captain, sir!\u2019 cried Number Two \u2013 for he was their leader.",
        "\u2018Permission to report, sir!\u2019 \u2018Yes, all right, Number Two, welcome back and all that.",
        "Find any hot springs?\u2019 said the captain despondently.",
        "\u2018No, sir!\u2019 \u2018Thought you wouldn\u2019t.\u2019 Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the bath.",
        "\u2018We have discovered another continent!\u2019 \u2018When was this?\u2019 \u2018It lies across the sea...\u2019 said Number Two, narrowing his eyes significantly, \u2018to the east!\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 Number Two turned to face the crowd.",
        "He raised his gun above his head.",
        "This is going to be great, thought the crowd.",
        "\u2018We have declared war on it!\u2019 Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing \u2013 this was beyond all expectation.",
        "\u2018Wait a minute,\u2019 shouted Ford Prefect, \u2018wait a minute!\u2019 He leapt to his feet and demanded silence.",
        "After a while he got it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was spontaneously composing a national anthem.",
        "\u2018Do we have to have the piper?\u2019 demanded Ford.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the captain, \u2018we\u2019ve given him a grant.\u2019 Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly decided that that way madness lay.",
        "Instead he slung a well judged rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two.",
        "\u2018War?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yes!\u2019 Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018On the next continent?\u2019 \u2018Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!\u2019 \u2018But there\u2019s no one even living there yet!\u2019 Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point.",
        "Number Two\u2019s gaze hovered undisturbed.",
        "In this respect his eyes were like a couple of mosquitoes that hover purposefully three inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes, fly swats or rolled newspapers.",
        "\u2018I know that,\u2019 he said, \u2018but there will be one day! So we have left an open ended ultimatum.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018And blown up a few military installations.\u2019 The captain leaned forward out of his bath.",
        "\u2018Military installations, Number Two?\u2019 he said.",
        "For a moment the eyes wavered.",
        "\u2018Yes, sir, well, potential military installations.",
        "All right...",
        "trees.\u2019 The moment of uncertainty passed \u2013 his eyes flicked like whips over his audience.",
        "\u2018And,\u2019 he roared, \u2018we interrogated a gazelle!\u2019 He flipped his Kill O Zap smartly under his arm and marched off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the ecstatic crowd.",
        "A few steps was all he managed before he was caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the clearing.",
        "Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together.",
        "\u2018So what else have you done?\u2019 he enquired after the celebrations had died down.",
        "\u2018We have started a culture,\u2019 said the marketing girl.",
        "\u2018Oh yes?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Yes.",
        "One of our film producers is already making a fascinating documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area.\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re not cavemen.\u2019 \u2018They look like cavemen.\u2019 \u2018Do they live in caves?\u2019 \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018They live in huts.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps they\u2019re having their caves redecorated,\u2019 called out a wag from the crowd.",
        "Ford rounded on him angrily.",
        "\u2018Very funny,\u2019 he said, \u2018but have you noticed that they\u2019re dying out?\u2019 On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods, where they had crept away to die.",
        "Those that still lived seemed stricken and listless, as if they were suffering from some disease of the spirit rather than the body.",
        "They moved sluggishly and with an infinite sadness.",
        "Their future had been taken away from them.",
        "\u2018Dying out!\u2019 repeated Ford.",
        "\u2018Do you know what that means?\u2019 \u2018Er...",
        "we shouldn\u2019t sell them any life insurance?\u2019 called out the wag again.",
        "Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd.",
        "\u2018Can you try and understand,\u2019 he said, \u2018that it\u2019s just since we\u2019ve arrived here that they\u2019ve started dying out!\u2019 \u2018In fact that comes over terribly well in this film,\u2019 said the marketing girl, \u2018and just gives it that poignant twist which is the hallmark of the really great documentary.",
        "The producer\u2019s very committed.\u2019 \u2018He should be,\u2019 muttered Ford.",
        "\u2018I gather,\u2019 said the girl, turning to address the captain, who was beginning to nod off, \u2018that he wants to make one about you next, Captain.\u2019 \u2018Oh really?\u2019 he said, coming to with a start.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s awfully nice.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of responsibility, the loneliness of command...\u2019 The captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment.",
        "\u2018Well, I wouldn\u2019t overstress that angle, you know,\u2019 he said finally, \u2018one\u2019s never alone with a rubber duck.\u2019 He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the crowd.",
        "All this while, the management consultant had been sitting in stony silence, his fingertips pressed to his temples to indicate that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary.",
        "At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn\u2019t happened.",
        "He rose to his feet.",
        "\u2018If,\u2019 he said tersely, \u2018we could for a moment move on to the subject of fiscal policy...\u2019 \u2018Fiscal policy!\u2019 whooped Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018Fiscal policy!\u2019 The management consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish could have copied.",
        "\u2018Fiscal policy...\u2019 he repeated, \u2018that is what I said.\u2019 \u2018How can you have money,\u2019 demanded Ford, \u2018if none of you actually produces anything? It doesn\u2019t grow on trees, you know.\u2019 \u2018If you would allow me to continue...\u2019 Ford nodded dejectedly.",
        "\u2018Thank you.",
        "Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich.\u2019 Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves with which their track suits were stuffed.",
        "\u2018But we have also,\u2019 continued the management consultant, \u2018run into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship\u2019s peanut.\u2019 Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd.",
        "The management consultant waved them down.",
        "\u2018So in order to obviate this problem,\u2019 he continued, \u2018and effectively revalue the leaf, we are about to embark on a massive defoliation campaign, and...",
        "er, burn down all the forests.",
        "I think you\u2019ll all agree that\u2019s a sensible move under the circumstances.\u2019 The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out whoops of delight and gave the management consultant a standing ovation.",
        "The accountants amongst them looked forward to a profitable autumn.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re all mad,\u2019 explained Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re absolutely barmy,\u2019 he suggested.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re a bunch of raving nutters,\u2019 he opined.",
        "The tide of opinion was beginning to turn against him.",
        "What had started out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd\u2019s view, deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the main directed at them they wearied of it.",
        "Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him.",
        "\u2018Is it perhaps in order,\u2019 she demanded, \u2018to enquire what you\u2019ve been doing all these months, then? You and that other interloper have been missing since the day we arrived.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve been on a journey,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018We went to try and find out something about this planet.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the girl archly, \u2018doesn\u2019t sound very productive to me.\u2019 \u2018No? Well have I got news for you, my love.",
        "We have discovered this planet\u2019s future.\u2019 Ford waited for this statement to have its effect.",
        "It didn\u2019t have any.",
        "They didn\u2019t know what he was talking about.",
        "He continued.",

        "Burn down the forests, anything, it won\u2019t make a scrap of difference.",
        "Your future history has already happened.",
        "Two million years you\u2019ve got and that\u2019s it.",
        "At the end of that time your race will be dead, gone and good riddance to you.",
        "Remember that, two million years!\u2019 The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance.",
        "People as rich as they had suddenly become shouldn\u2019t be obliged to listen to this sort of gibberish.",
        "Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and he would go away.",
        "They didn\u2019t need to bother.",
        "Ford was already stalking out of the clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two, who was already firing his Kill O Zap into some neighbouring trees.",
        "He turned back once.",
        "\u2018Two million years!\u2019 he said and laughed.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said the captain with a soothing smile, \u2018still time for a few more baths.",
        "Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped it over the side.\u2019 33 A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach.",
        "What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty nine smaller squares, thirteen to a side.",
        "Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each.",
        "Sitting morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local native men to whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious concept embodied in these stones.",
        "So far they had not done well.",
        "They had attempted to eat some of them, bury others and throw the rest of them away.",
        "Arthur had finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he\u2019d managed to get the day before.",
        "Along with the rapid deterioration in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence.",
        "In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of letters on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the natives to add some more themselves.",
        "It was not going well.",
        "Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, \u2018Q scores ten, you see, and it\u2019s on a triple word score, so...",

        "Arthur looked up with a start.",
        "He suddenly had a feeling that all this might look slightly foolish.",

        "\u2018What\u2019s that supposed to achieve?\u2019 asked Ford.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!\u2019 Arthur burst out angrily.",
        "He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of foolishness from which he was currently suffering.",
        "It didn\u2019t.",

        "\u2018Face it,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018those zeebs over there are your ancestors, not these poor creatures here.\u2019 He went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging listlessly with the stone letters.",

        "\u2018What?\u2019 he screamed.",
        "\u2018What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and say that!\u2019 He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs rasped.",
        "There was no answer from anyone.",
        "There was no one to hear him or speak to him.",
        "The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each other.",
        "Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its single seat.",
        "His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged.",

        "Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was \u2013 indeed, is \u2013 one of the Universe\u2019s very small number of immortal beings.",
        "Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them.",
        "Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards.",
        "He had had his immortality inadvertently thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands.",
        "The precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying.",
        "Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz on the ship\u2019s stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn\u2019t been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have done.",
        "To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, cleaning up on high yield long term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody.",
        "In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn\u2019t cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you know that you\u2019ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o\u2019clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.",
        "So things began to pall for him.",
        "The merry smiles he used to wear at other people\u2019s funerals began to fade.",
        "He began to despise the Universe in general and everybody in it in particular.",
        "This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on for ever.",
        "It was this.",
        "He would insult the Universe.",
        "That is, he would insult everybody in it.",
        "Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order.",
        "When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, \u2018A man can dream, can\u2019t he?\u2019 And so he had started out.",
        "He equipped a spaceship that was built to last with a computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved.",
        "His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space.",

        "The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in.",
        "2 This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave.",

        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "There was a quiet pause.",
        "\u2018The difficulty with this conversation,\u2019 said Arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, \u2018is that it\u2019s very different from most of the ones I\u2019ve had of late.",
        "Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees.",
        "They weren\u2019t like this.",

        "\u2018Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very very simple.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well I\u2019m not sure I believe that.\u2019 They sat down and composed their thoughts.",

        "\u2018There, behind that sofa!\u2019 Arthur looked.",
        "Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them.",
        "He boggled intelligently at it.",
        "Shrewd questions sprang into his mind.",
        "\u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018is there a sofa in that field?\u2019 \u2018I told you!\u2019 shouted Ford, leaping to his feet.",
        "\u2018Eddies in the space\u2013time continuum!\u2019 \u2018And this is his sofa, is it?\u2019 asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses.",
        "\u2018Arthur!\u2019 shouted Ford at him.",
        "\u2018That sofa is there because of the space\u2013time instability I\u2019ve been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with.",
        "It\u2019s been washed up out of the continuum, it\u2019s space\u2013 time jetsam, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, we\u2019ve got to catch it, it\u2019s our only way out of here!\u2019 He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field.",
        "\u2018Catch it?\u2019 muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass.",
        "With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture.",
        "They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way.",
        "The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake.",
        "Arthur felt happy.",
        "He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan.",
        "Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth.",
        "The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others.",
        "Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was.",
        "Still they pursued, still it danced and spun, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it.",
        "With a heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, St John\u2019s Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the Australian Series in the year 198\u2014, with England needing only twenty eight runs to win.",
