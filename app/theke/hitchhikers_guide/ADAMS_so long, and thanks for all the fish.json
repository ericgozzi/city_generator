I give stuff away here. There are spoilers ahead. Just read the book. I\u2019ll be here when you get back. No, I mean it. I\u2019ll put down some asterisks. I\u2019ll see you after them, when you\u2019ve read the book. * * * Douglas Adams was tall. He was brilliant: I\u2019ve met a handful of geniuses, and I\u2019d count him as one of them. He was a frustrated performer, a remarkable explainer and communicator, an enthusiast. He was an astonishing comic writer: he could craft sentences that changed the way a reader viewed the world, and sum up complex and difficult issues in aptly chosen metaphors. He combined the trappings of science fiction with profound social commentary and a healthy sense of humour to create fresh worlds. He loved computers and was an astonishingly fine public speaker. He was a bestselling author. He was a competent guitarist, a world traveller, an environ mentalist, a man who held remarkably wonderful parties, a gourmand. What he was not, and this may seem somewhat odd, especially when you consider how many of them he wrote and sold, and how famously well he wrote them, was a novelist. And this, I suspect unarguably, is the oddest of his novels. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish was Douglas\u2019s first attempt to write a novel from scratch. In many ways it could be seen as an experiment. A transitional novel between the galaxy spanning romps of the first three Hitchhiker books and the more Earth bound adventures of Dirk Gently. It was, after all, the first of the three of Douglas\u2019s books not to have originated in the extraordinary period of creativity that took him from the creation of the Hitchhiker\u2019s radio series to the end of his time as script editor of Doctor Who. His first two books, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, had strong foundations: they were built on the backs of the scripts that Douglas, and (for the second series) Douglas and John Lloyd, had crafted for the original Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy BBC Radio 4 series. The third book, Life, the Universe and Everything, was adapted from an unused outline Douglas had written for a Doctor Who film, Doctor Who and the Krikketmen. His next book, the remarkable Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency, was adapted from Douglas\u2019s unfilmed Doctor Who story Shada (with a sprinkling of ideas from the filmed Doctor Who story City of Death). The first books had been written by Douglas as a young man for a world that expected nothing, as paperback originals. Now Douglas was, for the first time, being published in hardback. He was a bestselling novelist, who had not yet written a book he was proud of. This may partly have been because he was not a novelist. Now he needed to write a book he had been paid a lot of money to write. His accountant had embezzled most of the money and then killed himself. Douglas Adams had gone to Hollywood on his first, abortive, quest to get The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy made into a film. He had lived there for over a year, doing drafts of the film, did not have a good time and, surprised and a little battered, he had returned home to a small converted stable house off Upper Street in Islington where, eventually, and under pressure, he put off actually writing So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish. His publishers, Pan, found themselves, early in 1984, soliciting a book that was, for the most part, unwritten and, for that matter, mostly unplotted. The lenticular image on the original cover showed a walrus that became a dinosaur, because Douglas had mentioned that there would be a walrus in the book. There would be no walrus in the book. It became part of the story of the book that, as the publishing date of the book got closer and the book got no closer to being written, publisher Sonny Mehta had taken a hotel suite and essentially locked Douglas in to write it, editing the pages as they came through. It was a strange way for a book to be written, and something Douglas used as an excuse for any problems that the book had. But it was a book he was still particularly proud of when it came out. I remember that. Douglas Adams had returned from America to Islington, and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish occurs in the space that Southern California isn\u2019t. Which is to say that both Douglas\u2019s Outer Space and his Southern California are extremely Californian: the hotel in which rock stars read Language, Truth and Logic by the pool and the bar in which Ford Prefect attempts to pay his bill with an American Express card are not a galaxy apart, and the hooker who has a special service for rich people could exist as easily in one world as another. Arthur Dent, in previous stories a flat character who existed mostly to boggle at the improbabilities, often infinite, he was confronted with, became someone significantly more like Douglas. Douglas\u2019s return from America was echoed in Arthur Dent\u2019s return from hitchhiking across all of time and space to an Earth that the readers believed to have been destroyed, and his explanation to the world that he had been in America. It might be seen as a problem for a writer who was considered a social satirist to have, a few pages into the first book in a bestselling series, destroyed the Earth. On the good side it sets you free to explore the vastness of the infinite. On the downside, it rather limits you as an observational humourist, when it comes to specifics, and while Douglas may not have been a novelist, he was definitely an observational humourist. Still, I think there\u2019s another reason for the restoration of the Earth at the beginning of this book. Like it or not, and when it came out some people did and some people didn\u2019t, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish is a love story, and the novel puts an Earth back for there to be a love story on. Underneath all the glitter, Arthur and Fenchurch and the unlikely circumstances of their meeting, their love and the travails thereof are the true subjects of the book. And as we grow older our reading of books changes. As a young man, writing a book about Douglas Adams and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, I remember picking up on the awkwardness of Chapter 25, and Douglas\u2019s rhetorical question as to whether or not Arthur Dent has... \u2018... spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?\u2019 Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it. I took it, at the time, as a manifestation of Douglas\u2019s contempt and discomfort with his audience, and was uncomfortable with it. Rereading it a quarter of a century later, I found myself reading those paragraphs as worried bluster, as if Douglas was scared that he was out of his depth, and was trying to respond to critics or to friends ahead of time. I still suspect that, had there been time to rewrite, to rethink, to revise, that strange breaking of the fourth wall and the author\u2013reader compact, might never have happened. I do not think it would have been a better book for not having been finished in a hotel bedroom while Sonny Mehta watched videos in the room next door. After all, it is part of its charm that So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish reads as if it has not so much been plotted as stumbled upon or backed into. It is surrealist in the way that a book extracted from the author without pause for inspection, for second thoughts or thousandth thoughts can only be. Characters appear and fade, dreamlike. Reality is frangible. The novel circles one event: a couple making love naked in the clouds, in perfect flying magical dream sex, an event that is practically a poem. So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish has, beneath the elegant veneer, the simplest, easiest, most traditional of plots: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl, makes love to her in the clouds and sets off with her to find God\u2019s Final Message To His Creation. And does. After all, for a book suffused from start to finish with gloom and melancholia, a book in which the universe itself is fundamentally perverse, when it is not actually malicious, So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish is often peculiarly upbeat: Chapter 18 for example, gives us, triumphantly, something unseen in the Hitchhiker universe until now: transient and barely recognizable, but it\u2019s there: joy. He hadn\u2019t realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before, which was \u2018Yes\u2019. NEIL GAIMAN Author of Don\u2019t Panic: Douglas Adams and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and subsequently a famous author Prologue Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has \u2013 or had \u2013 a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper which were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were unhappy, even the ones with digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\u00e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever. This is her story. 1 That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year. It was cold and windy, which was normal. It started to rain, which was particularly normal. A spacecraft landed, which was not. There was nobody around to see it except for some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked. It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single beam of light. From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful \u2013 a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small. Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest Mid Galactic Census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right. You\u2019d probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn\u2019t tell anybody anything they didn\u2019t already know \u2013 except that every single person in the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped. The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb. At last it dropped and was quiet. A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself. A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within. A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm. It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back to the ship. Already the rain was streaming through its hair. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he called out, \u2018thank you very\u2014\u2019 He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom. It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI. BE LIKE THE TWENTY SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE \u2013 BARK! \u2018Hold on!\u2019 the figure called, waving at the ship. The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re unfolded, and allowed him back in. He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag. He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had already begun its ascent. Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky. His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on. More lights. Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded. The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his pace, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared. And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself. Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him. It was a low bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing \u2013 sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed. The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night. It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared. To the figure\u2019s apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, \u2018My other car is also a Porsche.\u2019 2 Rob McKenna was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he\u2019d had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everybody. He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear. The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls. It wasn\u2019t that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down, always the rain. It was raining now, just for a change. It was a particular type of rain that he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type 17. He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour\u2019s boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them the huskies have pissed on. Rob McKenna had two hundred and thirty one different types of rain entered in his little book, and he didn\u2019t like any of them. He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying. Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab drumming), 11 (breezy droplets) and now his least favourite of all, 17. Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didn\u2019t make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off. He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on. In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off. Swish swish swish flop swish swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flap scrape. He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore. It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside. A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing machine, and hitching. \u2018Poor miserable sod,\u2019 thought Rob McKenna to himself, realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, \u2018must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you.\u2019 He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on. \u2018See what I mean?\u2019 he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it. \u2018You get some right bastards on the road.\u2019 Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitchhiker, drenched by the roadside. For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night. At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles. And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, for, though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a Rain God. All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him. 3 The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did exactly the same thing. The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind. After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds. A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that normally he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift, only he couldn\u2019t this time because he wasn\u2019t going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand. He concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs up sign, as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet, and he would catch him next time around. The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as the Renault. A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey a \u2018Hello\u2019 or a \u2018Sorry we\u2019re going the other way\u2019 or a \u2018Hey look, there\u2019s someone in the rain, what a jerk\u2019 was entirely unclear. A green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever the message was, it came from Steve and Carola. The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying \u2018And another thing...\u2019 twenty minutes after admitting he\u2019s lost the argument. The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound travelled rather well. The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly. And another. The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed meaninglessly. A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes. Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the Cortina spun its wheels in the wet and careered off up the road rather amusingly. The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected. As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went into hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice, in its way, was served. The figure trudged on. A Saab drew to a halt beside him. Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, \u2018Have you come far?\u2019 The figure turned towards it. He stopped and grasped the handle of the door. * * * The figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet called the Earth, a world whose entire entry in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy comprised the two words \u2018Mostly harmless\u2019. The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a far from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble. 4 Whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the lower south side of Han Dold City because it wasn\u2019t the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive. Any observers in the place would have been mean hawklike observers, heavily armed, with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didn\u2019t like. One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of missile crisis sort of hush. Even the evil looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, which was a service it provided for free. All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on stalks. The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defence budget with an American Express card, which was not acceptable anywhere in the known Universe. \u2018What are you worried about?\u2019 he asked in a cheery kind of voice. \u2018The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of Neo Relativity out here? There\u2019s whole new areas of physics which can take care of this sort of thing. Time dilation effects, temporal relastatics...\u2019 \u2018We are not worried about the expiration date,\u2019 said the man to whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city. His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr made by the opening of an ICBM silo. A hand like a side of meat tapped on the bar top, lightly denting it. \u2018Well, that\u2019s good then,\u2019 said Ford, packing his satchel and preparing to leave. The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving. Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn\u2019t attached to anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home. It had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to medical science. Medical science had decided they didn\u2019t like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the Old Pink Dog Bar. The new barman didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything kooky like that, he just knew a useful ally when he saw one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered. Ford Prefect sat still. \u2018We are not worried about the expiration date,\u2019 repeated the barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect\u2019s full attention. \u2018We are worried about the entire piece of plastic.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Ford. He seemed a little taken aback. \u2018This,\u2019 said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the Land Where Fish are Eternally Blessed, \u2018we don\u2019t accept.\u2019 Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn\u2019t have any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb. \u2018But you don\u2019t understand,\u2019 said Ford, his expression slowly ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity. \u2018This is the American Express card. It is the finest way of settling bills known to man. Haven\u2019t you read their junk mail?\u2019 The cheery quality of Ford\u2019s voice was beginning to grate on the barman\u2019s ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a War Requiem. One of the bones in Ford\u2019s shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropractor. He hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily, the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over. The barman slid the card back across the bar to Ford. \u2018We have never,\u2019 he said with muted savagery, \u2018heard of this thing.\u2019 This was hardly surprising. Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error towards the end of the fifteen years\u2019 sojourn he had spent on the planet Earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express company had got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic stricken demands of its debt collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass. He had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept. \u2018Credit?\u2019 he said. \u2018Aaaargggh...\u2019 These two words were usually coupled together in the Old Pink Dog Bar. \u2018I thought,\u2019 gasped Ford, \u2018that this was meant to be a class establishment...\u2019 He glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar\u2019s inner recesses were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his now, carefully picking up the threads of their former conversations about murders, drug rings and music publishing deals. They knew what would happen and didn\u2019t want to watch in case it put them off their drinks. \u2018You gonna die, boy,\u2019 the barman murmured quietly at Ford Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have one of those signs hanging up which said, \u2018Please don\u2019t ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends\u2019, but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to, \u2018Please don\u2019t ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends\u2019. However, this made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didn\u2019t have the same ring to it, so it was taken down again. It was felt that the story would get about of its own accord, and it had. \u2018Lemme look at the bill again,\u2019 said Ford. He picked it up and studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons. It was a rather lengthy piece of paper. At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always takes so long to copy on to the registration form. He had, after all, been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps, thugs and record executives who suddenly couldn\u2019t remember who he was. He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets. There was, as he knew, nothing in them. He rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the half opened flap of his satchel. The disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder. \u2018You see,\u2019 said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of Ford\u2019s, \u2018I have a reputation to think of. You see that, don\u2019t you?\u2019 This is it, thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill, it had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018if it\u2019s your reputation...\u2019 With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar top his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing. \u2018Want a write up?\u2019 The barman\u2019s face stopped in mid wobble. The bird\u2019s talons stopped in mid furrow. The hand slowly released its grip. \u2018That,\u2019 said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between dry lips, \u2018will do nicely, sir.\u2019 5 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ. Indeed, its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours unless: a) they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way; b) their lives would be otherwise in danger; c) they really want to. Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut, Ford always preferred to muck about with the first two. He stepped out along the street, walking briskly. The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music and the distant sound of warring police tribes. He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the moment wasn\u2019t much. A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed. Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to the spaceport, but he had thought that before. He knew he was going through that part of the city where people\u2019s plans often changed quite abruptly. \u2018Do you want to have a good time?\u2019 said a voice from a doorway. \u2018As far as I can tell,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019m having one. Thanks.\u2019 \u2018Are you rich?\u2019 said another. This made Ford laugh. He turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture. \u2018Do I look rich?\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t know,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you\u2019ll get rich. I have a very special service for rich people...\u2019 \u2018Oh yes?\u2019 said Ford, intrigued but careful. \u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018I tell them it\u2019s OK to be rich.\u2019 Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players are two a penny in Han Dold City. Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway. \u2018You what?\u2019 he said. The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow. She was tall, and had that kind of self possessed shyness which is a great trick if you can do it. \u2018It\u2019s my big number,\u2019 she said. \u2018I have a master\u2019s degree in social economics and can be very convincing. People love it. Especially in this city.\u2019 \u2018Goosnargh,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian word he used when he knew he should say something but didn\u2019t know what it should be. He sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that Ol\u2019 Janx Spirit and a towel. He opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that the Ol\u2019 Janx Spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of his towel. \u2018Want some?\u2019 he said, after he\u2019d had a swig himself. She shrugged and took the proffered bottle. They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clam our of burglar alarms in the next block. \u2018As it happens, I\u2019m owed a lot of money,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018so if I ever get hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?\u2019 \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll be here,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018So how much is a lot?\u2019 \u2018Fifteen years\u2019 back pay.\u2019 \u2018For?\u2019 \u2018Writing two words.\u2019 \u2018Zarquon,\u2019 said the girl. \u2018Which one took the time?\u2019 \u2018The first one. Once I\u2019d got that the second one just came one afternoon after lunch.\u2019 A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them. It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other. Cars with screaming sirens converged on the area, only to find themselves being picked off by \u2019copters which came thudding through the air between the city\u2019s mountainous tower blocks. \u2018In fact,\u2019 said Ford, having to shout now above the din, \u2018it wasn\u2019t quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down.\u2019 He took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel. \u2018Then the planet got demolished,\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Really worthwhile job, eh? They\u2019ve still got to pay me, though.\u2019 \u2018You work for that thing?\u2019 the girl yelled back. \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Good number.\u2019 \u2018You want to see the stuff I wrote?\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Before it gets erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net. Someone must have found out by now that the planet I spent fifteen years on has been demolished. They missed it on the last few revisions, but it can\u2019t escape their notice for ever.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s getting impossible to talk, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 She shrugged and pointed upwards. There was a \u2019copter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from the building. The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his finger tips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all of them. \u2018Can we move?\u2019 They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the pack animal. All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide. They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted on a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen of the Guide. He located his entry. \u2018Earth: Mostly harmless.\u2019 Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages. \u2018Here it comes,\u2019 he said. \u2018Please wait,\u2019 said the messages. \u2018Entries are being updated over the Sub Etha Net. This entry is being revised. The system will be down for ten seconds.\u2019 At the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past. \u2018Hey look,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018if you get paid, look me up. I\u2019m a working girl, and there are people over there who need me. I gotta go.\u2019 She brushed aside Ford\u2019s half articulated protests, and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the ether. Out in the street things had calmed down a little. The police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers, the street theatre group were re emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect, and a little way further on the steel grey limousine was parked silently by the kerbside. The girl hurried towards it. * * * Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was bathing Ford Prefect\u2019s face, and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment. For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed off entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data \u2013 text, diagrams, figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars to go everywhere. Pages and pages of it. It was all there, everything he had written. With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards and forwards through it, stopping here and there at various entries. \u2018Tips for aliens in New York: \u2018Land anywhere, Central Park, anywhere. No one will care, or indeed even notice. \u2018Surviving: Get a job as a cab driver immediately. A cab driver\u2019s job is to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines called taxis. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know how the machine works and you can\u2019t speak the language, don\u2019t understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae growing out of your head. Believe me, this is the best way of staying inconspicuous. \u2018If your body is really weird try showing it to people in the streets for money. \u2018Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling, Noxios or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East River, which is said to be richer in those lovely life giving nutrients than the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved. \u2018Having fun: This is the big section. It is impossible to have more fun without electrocuting your pleasure centres...\u2019 Ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked \u2018Mode Execute Ready\u2019 instead of the now old fashioned \u2018Access Standby\u2019 which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone age \u2018Off\u2019. This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon ships. And then at last, five seconds after the moment he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and Arthur Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast. There was no mistake, there couldn\u2019t have been. The Earth had definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away into space. And yet here \u2013 he activated the Guide again \u2013 was his own entry on how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered. He read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder. Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it was this, that something very weird was happening; and if something very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to be happening to him. He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street again. Walking north again he passed a steel grey limousine parked by the kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, \u2018It\u2019s OK, honey, it\u2019s really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured...\u2019 Ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky. He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, and once clear of them hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung permanently above it. Ten minutes later, with all the \u2019copter\u2019s sirens blaring and its rapid fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing lights at Han Dold spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat. Since he hadn\u2019t damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into one of its huge, voluptuous body hugging seats. This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing. \u2018Yes please,\u2019 he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to offer him anything at all. He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously reinstated entry on the planet Earth. He had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve. It suddenly occured to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and if he knew. * * * Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty seven light years away in a Saab, and anxious. Behind him in the back seat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he climbed in. He didn\u2019t know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with, with... This is absurd, he told himself. Calm down, he told himself. You are not, he continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster, in a fit and rational state. You have just hitchhiked over a hundred thousand light years across the galaxy, you are very tired, a little confused and extremely vulnerable. Relax, don\u2019t panic, concentrate on breathing deeply. He twisted round in his seat. \u2018Are you sure she\u2019s all right?\u2019 he said again. Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heart thumpingly beautiful, he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the exact shading of her hair. And nor could he ask her anything about herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious. \u2018She\u2019s just drugged,\u2019 said her brother, shrugging, not moving his eyes from the road ahead. \u2018And that\u2019s all right, is it?\u2019 said Arthur, in alarm. \u2018Suits me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Er,\u2019 he added after a moment\u2019s thought. The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly. After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell \u2013 the wonderful girl\u2019s brother\u2019s name was Russell, a name which, to Arthur\u2019s mind, always suggested burly men with blond moustaches and blow dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches \u2013 had quickly discovered they didn\u2019t like each other at all. Russell was a burly man. He had a blond moustache. His hair was fine and blow dried. To be fair to him \u2013 though Arthur didn\u2019t see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it \u2013 he, Arthur, was looking pretty grim himself. A man can\u2019t cross a hundred thousand light years, mostly in other people\u2019s baggage compartments, without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot. \u2018She\u2019s not a junkie,\u2019 said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be. \u2018She\u2019s under sedation.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s terrible,\u2019 said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again. She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it. \u2018What\u2019s the matter with her, is she ill?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Russell, \u2018merely barking mad.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur, horrified. \u2018Loopy, completely bananas. I\u2019m taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog.\u2019 \u2018A hedgehog?\u2019 Russell hooted his horn fiercely at a car that came round the corner towards them halfway on to their side of the road, making them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better. \u2018Well, maybe not a hedgehog,\u2019 he said after he\u2019d settled down again. \u2018Though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did. If somebody thinks they\u2019re a hedgehog, presumably you just give \u2019em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they feel better. At least medical science could deal with it, that\u2019s the point. Seems that\u2019s not good enough for Fenny, though.\u2019 \u2018Fenny...?\u2019 \u2018You know what I got her for Christmas?\u2019 \u2018Well, no.\u2019 \u2018Black\u2019s Medical Dictionary.\u2019 \u2018Nice present.\u2019 \u2018I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order.\u2019 \u2018You say her name is Fenny?\u2019 \u2018Yeah. Take your pick, I said. Anything in here can be dealt with. The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have something different. Just to make life difficult. She was like that at school, you know.\u2019 \u2018Was she?\u2019 \u2018She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of.\u2019 \u2018I can see how that would be irritating,\u2019 said Arthur doubtfully. He was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was a rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldn\u2019t sustain the name Fenella properly. \u2018Not that I wasn\u2019t sympathetic,\u2019 continued Russell, \u2018but it did get a bit irritating. She was limping for months.\u2019 He slowed down. \u2018This is your turning, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Ah, no,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018five miles further on. If that\u2019s all right.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 said Russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn\u2019t, and speeded up again. It was in fact Arthur\u2019s turning, but he couldn\u2019t leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up. He could take either of the next two turnings. They led back to the village that had been his home, though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks had been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that only very very normal things can create, when seen where the mind is unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar light. By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it, living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight years since he had left, but what time had passed here he could hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home, should not be here. Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence. \u2018Delusions,\u2019 said Russell. \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur, started out of his train of thought. \u2018She says she suffers from strange delusions that she\u2019s living in the real world. It\u2019s no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says that\u2019s why the delusions are so strange. Don\u2019t know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting. Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer. I mean you can only muck about so much can\u2019t you?\u2019 Arthur frowned, not for the first time. \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018And all this dreams and nightmare stuff. And the doctors going on about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns.\u2019 \u2018Jumps?\u2019 \u2018This,\u2019 said Fenny. Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn\u2019t in the car. Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping peacefully. \u2018What did she say?\u2019 he asked anxiously. \u2018She said \u201cthis\u201d.\u2019 \u2018This what?\u2019 \u2018This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso\u2019s tweezers. She\u2019s barking mad, I thought I\u2019d mentioned that.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t seem to care very much.\u2019 Arthur tried to say it as matter of factly as possible but it didn\u2019t seem to work. \u2018Look, buster...\u2019 \u2018OK, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s none of my business. I didn\u2019t mean it to sound like that,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I know you care a lot, obviously,\u2019 he added, lying. \u2018I know that you have to deal with it somehow. You\u2019ll have to excuse me. I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula.\u2019 He stared furiously out of the window. He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he thought had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said \u2018this\u2019 to him, and that he wouldn\u2019t wish her brother on a Vogon. \u2018So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?\u2019 he went on to say as quickly as he could. \u2018Look, this is my sister, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m talking to you about...\u2019 \u2018OK, I\u2019m sorry. Perhaps you\u2019d better let me out. This is...\u2019 At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a sieve. Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked \u2018McKenna\u2019s All Weather Haulage\u2019. The tension eased as the rain subsided. \u2018It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, you remember?\u2019 Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitch hiked back from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it would only confuse matters further. \u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a caf\u00e9 somewhere. Rickmansworth. Don\u2019t know what she was doing there, but that was where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich.\u2019 Arthur winced. \u2018I\u2019m very sorry to hear that,\u2019 he said a little stiffly. Russell made a sort of grumping noise. \u2018So what,\u2019 said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together, \u2018was the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?\u2019 \u2018Bobbing up and down, of course. He was dead.\u2019 \u2018But what...\u2019 \u2018Come on, you remember all that stuff. The hallucinations. Everyone said it was a cock up, the CIA trying experiments into drug warfare or something. Some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think they\u2019d been invaded.\u2019 \u2018What hallucinations were those exactly...?\u2019 said Arthur in a rather quiet voice. \u2018What do you mean, what hallucinations? I\u2019m talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we\u2019re going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off. The CIA denied it which meant it must be true.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something to steady himself, and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something, but nothing emerged. \u2018Anyway,\u2019 continued Russell, \u2018whatever drug it was it didn\u2019t seem to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana, so...\u2019 He shrugged. \u2018The Vogon...\u2019 squeaked Arthur. \u2018The yellow ships... vanished?\u2019 \u2018Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations,\u2019 said Russell, and looked at Arthur oddly. \u2018You trying to say you don\u2019t remember any of this? Where have you been, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u2019 This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he half leapt out of his seat with shock. \u2018Christ!!!\u2019 yelled Russell, fighting to control the car which was suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank. As the car lurched to a halt, the girl in the back was thrown against Russell\u2019s seat and collapsed awkwardly. Arthur twisted round in horror. \u2018Is she all right?\u2019 he blurted out. Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow dried hair. He tugged at his blond moustache. He turned to Arthur. \u2018Would you please,\u2019 he said, \u2018let go of the handbrake?\u2019 6 From here it was a four mile walk to his village: a mile further to the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of winding country lane. The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat. He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even some good painful blisters, would help to reassure him of his own existence at least, if not his sanity. It was 10.30 when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guinness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat. This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which first his house and then the entire planet Earth had been demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished. No, damn it, had been demolished, because if it hadn\u2019t then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and how had he got there if not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell had just been telling him were merely drug induced hallucinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing on...? He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn\u2019t going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he\u2019d been over it. He started again. This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort out later had happened, and... It still didn\u2019t make sense. He started again. This was the pub in which... This was a pub. Pubs served drinks and he couldn\u2019t half do with one. Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasn\u2019t the one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the door. And stopped. A small black wire haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl. Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an advertising friend of his, and was called Know Nothing Bozo because the way its hair stood up on its head reminded people of the President of the United States of America, and the dog knew Arthur, or at least should do. It was a stupid dog which could not even read an autocue, which was why some people had protested about its name, but it should at least have been able to recognize Arthur instead of standing there, hackles raised, as if Arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble witted life. This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself. Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he had to admit that the dog had a point. He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comment of a raucous kind, and worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill equipped to deal with. Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know Nothing Bozo the Non Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of Will\u2019s own commercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it. Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, there was his car, a grey Porsche 928S with a sign in the back window which read, \u2018My other car is also a Porsche.\u2019 Damn him. He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadn\u2019t known before. Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and under scrupulous bastards Arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his car every August so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on \u2013 and this was the same car Arthur remembered him having before. The number plate proclaimed its year. Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could have passed here. He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know Nothing Bozo jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now an alien on his own world. Try as they might, no one was even going to be able to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts. Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake? The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail \u2013 every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its unauthentic cast iron light fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts. It was all the stuff of his home, his world. He even knew this blasted dog. \u2018Hey, Know Nothing!\u2019 The sound of Will Smithers\u2019 voice meant he had to decide what to do quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment, and it was bitterly cold now. The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn\u2019t that Arthur disliked him as such \u2013 Will was quite fun. It was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way because, being in advertising, he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where he had got his jacket from. Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van. \u2018Hey, Know Nothing, what\u2019s up?\u2019 The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket that he\u2019d got a mate of his at the Road Research Laboratory to crash a car into specially, in order to get that battered look. Know Nothing yelped with delight and, having got the attention it wanted, was happy to forget Arthur. Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with the dog. \u2018Commies!\u2019 they all shouted at the dog in chorus. \u2018Commies, commies, commies!!!\u2019 The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage. They all laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night. Well, that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the van, this is quite definitely the planet I remember. 7 His house was still there. How or why, he had no idea. He had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone. And there it was. He hurriedly let himself in with a key he kept under a stone frog in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing. He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from. The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical, personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for non payment of bills on a credit card he didn\u2019t have, thirty three identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in today\u2019s sophisticated jet setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten. He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing. He collapsed, panting, on to his cold, musty smelling bed and for a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to. When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to come on. To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur\u2019s sense of logic. Since the Electricity Board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill, it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he didn\u2019t. Sending them money obviously only drew attention to yourself. The room was much as he had left it, i.e. festeringly untidy, though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust. Half read books and magazines nestled amongst piles of half used towels. Half pairs of socks reclined in half drunk cups of coffee. What was once a half eaten sandwich had now half turned into something that Arthur entirely didn\u2019t want to know about. Bung a fork of lightning through this lot, he thought to himself, and you\u2019d start the evolution of life off all over again. There was only one thing in the room that was different. For a moment or so he couldn\u2019t see what the one thing that was different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust. Then his eyes caught it and stopped. It was next to a battered old television on which it was only possible to watch Open University Study Courses, because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down. It was a box. Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it. It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to it. It was a cubic grey box, just over a foot on a side. It was tied with a single grey ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top. He got up, walked over and touched it in surprise. Whatever it was was clearly gift wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him to open it. Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of the box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box. He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe, nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It wasn\u2019t a proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It was a bowl. A fish bowl. It was made of the most wonderful glass, perfectly transparent, yet with an extraordinary silver grey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making. Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of the most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the tissue paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there was nothing. He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful. It was exquisite. But it was a fish bowl. He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea dream. Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowl\u2019s surface. He held it up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass. \u2018So Long,\u2019 they said, \u2018and Thanks...\u2019 And that was all. He blinked, and understood nothing. For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around, held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap and put it back on the table next to the television. He shook the little Babel fish from his ear and dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl. He wouldn\u2019t be needing it any more, except for watching foreign movies. He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light. He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes and was completely incapable of getting to sleep. * * * The night was uneasy with rain. The rain clouds themselves had now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport caf\u00e9 just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didn\u2019t know what else it might not do if further provoked. The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping list or a five pound note. The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that\u2019s trying to decide what sort of mood it\u2019s in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight. A skylight creaked open. It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was slightly rotten and the hinge had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open. A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof. It stood and watched the sky in silence. The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild looking creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosystem and all. Instead, there was Arthur Dent the smooth and casual, in corduroys and a chunky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed, his chin clean shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it please to stop. They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience. The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted. He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rainclouds parked somewhere away to the south. He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadn\u2019t expected. He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but he\u2019d never realized it could feel quite as good as that. He could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the New Forest. He must try this summer, he thought, and see what having leaves felt like. From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered, for they were creatures who learned very little on their journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields. He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that. He could go further and further back, but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things they\u2019d been startled by the day before. He left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly excited, one fractured. One fractured. He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in Pelmanism. He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is. He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to find her; but he could not. By straining too much for it, he could feel he was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander more easily once more. And again, he felt the fracture. Again he couldn\u2019t find it. This time, whatever his instinct was busy telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn\u2019t certain that it was Fenny or \u2013 perhaps it was a different fracture this time. It had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all. It was different. He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling, seeping, sinking. He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always the fracture kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache. And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was time, the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had sensed, the second fracture, lay in the distance before him across the land, the thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of Earth. And suddenly he was upon it. He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, falling. Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths. He woke. A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead. The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His shoulders dropped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers. At last he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what it meant, if it meant anything at all, he would think about in the morning; for now he would go to bed and sleep. His own bed, his own sleep. He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was. It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours, John Ainsworth. His rose bushes were carefully tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes and labelled, and Arthur wondered what he was doing above them. He wondered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground. He picked himself up, brushed himself down and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed. While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never, however, stood a chance of waking him up. 8 Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at all to discover it was the middle of February. He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes. Since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a virulent space disease he\u2019d picked up without knowing it in the Flargathon Gas Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the Earth was lucky there. He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat. Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring while he maintained a moment\u2019s respectful silence. Whoever it was would ring back if it was important. He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside. There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk \u2013 some documents from the council relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area; there was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity, and some postcards from friends vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days. He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which he marked \u2018Things To Do\u2019. Since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning, he even added the word \u2018Urgent!\u2019 He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega Market. The slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua Centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a duty free shop at a spaceport. The bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away. He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to Earth, kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A303. He had lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed. He had lost The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Well, he told himself, this time I really won\u2019t be needing it again. He had some calls to make. He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it out. He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department head. \u2018Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven\u2019t been in for six months but I\u2019ve gone mad.\u2019 \u2018Oh, not to worry. Thought it was probably something like that. Happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you?\u2019 \u2018When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?\u2019 \u2018Sometime in spring, I think.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll be in shortly after that.\u2019 \u2018Rightyho.\u2019 He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of numbers to try. \u2018Oh hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to see if I could have a word with Fenella, er... Fenella \u2013 Good Lord, silly me, I\u2019ll forget my own name next, er, Fenella \u2013 isn\u2019t this ridiculous? Patient of yours, dark haired girl, came in last night...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have any patients called Fenella.\u2019 \u2018Oh, don\u2019t you? I meant Fiona, of course, we just call her Fen...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry, goodbye.\u2019 Click. Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little. He had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night. \u2018Arthur!!!!\u2019 He grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he\u2019d had in Southern California. 9 He accepted another pint and took a pull at it. \u2018Of course, I had my own personal alchemist too.\u2019 \u2018You what?\u2019 He was getting silly and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the first effects it has is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he insisted with a happy glazed smile. \u2018It\u2019s why I\u2019ve lost so much weight.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said his audience. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he said again. \u2018The Californians have rediscovered alchemy. Oh yes.\u2019 He smiled again. \u2018Only,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s in a much more useful form than that which in...\u2019 He paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his head. \u2018In which the ancients used to practise it. Or at least,\u2019 he added, \u2018failed to practise it. They couldn\u2019t get it to work, you know. Nostradamus and that lot. Couldn\u2019t cut it.\u2019 \u2018Nostradamus?\u2019 said one of his audience. \u2018I didn\u2019t think he was an alchemist,\u2019 said another. \u2018I thought,\u2019 said a third, \u2018he was a seer.\u2019 \u2018He became a seer,\u2019 said Arthur to his audience, the component parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, \u2018because he was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that.\u2019 He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it. \u2018What has alchemy got to do,\u2019 asked a bit of the audience, \u2018with losing weight?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m glad you asked that,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Very glad. And I will now tell you what the connection is between...\u2019 He paused. \u2018Between those two things. The things you mentioned. I\u2019ll tell you.\u2019 He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts. It was like watching oil tankers doing three point turns in the English Channel. \u2018They\u2019ve discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold,\u2019 he said, in a sudden blurt of coherence. \u2018You\u2019re kidding.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018no,\u2019 he corrected himself, \u2018they have.\u2019 He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely. \u2018Have you been to California?\u2019 he demanded. \u2018Do you know the sort of stuff they do there?\u2019 Three members of his audience said they had and that he was talking nonsense. \u2018You haven\u2019t seen anything,\u2019 insisted Arthur. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he added, because someone was offering to buy another round. \u2018The evidence,\u2019 he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by more than a couple of inches, \u2018is before your eyes. Fourteen hours in a trance,\u2019 he said, \u2018in a tank. In a trance. I was in a tank. I think,\u2019 he added after a thoughtful pause, \u2018I already said that.\u2019 He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed. He composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a baseline drawn between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss. \u2018Long time,\u2019 he said instead, \u2018in a tank. In a trance.\u2019 He looked round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following attentively. He resumed. \u2018Where was I?\u2019 he said. \u2018In a trance,\u2019 said one. \u2018In a tank,\u2019 said another. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Thank you. And slowly,\u2019 he said, pressing onwards, \u2018slowly, slowly slowly, all your excess body fat turns... to...\u2019 he paused for effect, \u2018subcoo... subyoo... subtoocay...\u2019 \u2013 he paused for breath \u2013 \u2018subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed. Getting out of the tank is hell. What did you say?\u2019 \u2018I was just clearing my throat.\u2019 \u2018I think you doubt me.\u2019 \u2018I was clearing my throat.\u2019 \u2018She was clearing her throat,\u2019 confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018all right. And you then split the proceeds...\u2019 he paused again for a maths break, \u2018fifty fifty with the alchemist. Make a lot of money!\u2019 He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces. He felt very affronted by this. \u2018How else,\u2019 he demanded, \u2018could I afford to have my face dropped?\u2019 Friendly arms began to help him home. \u2018Listen,\u2019 he protested, as the cold February breeze brushed his face, \u2018looking lived in is all the rage in California at the moment. You\u2019ve got to look as if you\u2019ve seen the Galaxy. Life, I mean. You\u2019ve got to look as if you\u2019ve seen life. That\u2019s what I got. A face drop. Give me eight years, I said. I hope being thirty doesn\u2019t come back into fashion or I\u2019ve wasted a lot of money.\u2019 He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to help him along the lane to his house. \u2018Got in yesterday,\u2019 he mumbled. \u2018I\u2019m very very very happy to be home. Or somewhere very like it...\u2019 \u2018Jet lag,\u2019 muttered one of his friends. \u2018Long trip from California. Really mucks you up for a couple of days.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been there at all,\u2019 muttered another. \u2018I wonder where he has been. And what\u2019s happened to him.\u2019 * After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey. He wondered how he was going to find Fenny. He sat and looked at the fish bowl. He tapped it again, and despite being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which was gulping its way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before. Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He wondered who, and for what. 10 \u2018At the third stroke it will be one... thirty two... and twenty seconds. \u2018Beep... beep... beep.\u2019 Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked laugh. He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub Etha Net to the ship\u2019s superb hi fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing song voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin. \u2018At the third stroke it will be one... thirty two... and thirty seconds. \u2018Beep... beep... beep.\u2019 He tweaked the volume up just a little, while keeping a careful eye on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship\u2019s computer display. For the length of time he had in mind, the question of power consumption became significant. He didn\u2019t want a murder on his conscience. \u2018At the third stroke it will be one... thirty two... and forty seconds. \u2018Beep... beep... beep.\u2019 He checked around the small ship. He walked down the short corridor. \u2018At the third stroke...\u2019 He stuck his head into the small, functional, gleaming steel bathroom. \u2018... it will be...\u2019 It sounded fine in there. He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters. \u2018... one... thirty two...\u2019 It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of the speakers. He took down the towel. \u2018... and fifty seconds.\u2019 Fine. He checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasn\u2019t at all satisfied with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He broke open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button. He didn\u2019t know why he hadn\u2019t thought of that before. A whooshing rumbling noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a slight hiss could be heard again. It stopped. He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door again on to the now empty cargo hold. \u2018... one... thirty three... and fifty seconds.\u2019 Very nice. \u2018Beep... beep... beep.\u2019 He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency suspended animation chamber, which was where he particularly wanted it to be heard. \u2018At the third stroke it will be one... thirty... four... precisely.\u2019 He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck. He double checked the computer display above the freezer bed, dimmed the lights and checked it again. \u2018At the third stroke it will be...\u2019 He tiptoed out and went to the control cabin. \u2018... one... thirty four and twenty seconds.\u2019 The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone in London, which he wasn\u2019t, not by a long way. He gazed out into the inky night. The star the size of a brilliant biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was Zondostina, or as it was known on the world from which the rather stilted, sing song voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta. The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area was the giant gas planet Sesefras Magna, where the Xaxisian battleships docked, and just rising over its horizon was a small cool blue moon, Epun. \u2018At the third stroke it will be...\u2019 For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship and Epun closed, as the ship\u2019s computer teased and kneaded the numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon, close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual obscurity. \u2018One... fifty nine...\u2019 His original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he\u2019d had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal\u2019s origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, travelling at light speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did. \u2018Beep... beep... beep...\u2019 He sniggered. He didn\u2019t like to think of himself as the sort of person who giggled or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an hour now. \u2018At the third stroke...\u2019 The ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit round a little known and never visited moon. Almost perfect. One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ship\u2019s little Escape O Buggy, balancing actions, reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, and saw that it was good. Before he left, he turned out the lights. As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three day journey to the orbiting space station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still. \u2018At the third stroke, it will be two... thirteen... and fifty seconds.\u2019 He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he didn\u2019t have room. \u2018Beep... beep... beep.\u2019 11 \u2018April showers I hate especially.\u2019 However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed determined to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move to another table, but there didn\u2019t seem to be one free in the whole cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely. \u2018Bloody April showers. Hate hate hate.\u2019 Arthur stared, frowning, out of the window. A light, sunny spray of rain hung over the motorway. Two months he\u2019d been back now. Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy. People had such extraordinarily short memories, including him. Eight years of crazed wanderings round the Galaxy now seemed to him not so much like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped from the TV and kept in the back of a cupboard without bothering to watch. One effect that still lingered, though, was his joy at being back. Now that the Earth\u2019s atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest. \u2018Well, I like them,\u2019 he said suddenly, \u2018and for all the obvious reasons. They\u2019re light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you feel good.\u2019 The man snorted derisively. \u2018That\u2019s what they all say,\u2019 he said, and glowered darkly from his corner seat. He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening, unprovoked remark had been, \u2018I\u2019m a lorry driver. I hate driving in the rain. Ironic, isn\u2019t it? Bloody ironic.\u2019 If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not encouraging. But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred now. \u2018They all say that about bloody April showers,\u2019 he said. \u2018So bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather.\u2019 He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say something extraordinary about the government. \u2018What I want to know is this,\u2019 he said, \u2018if it\u2019s going to be nice weather, why,\u2019 he almost spat, \u2018can\u2019t it be nice without bloody raining?\u2019 Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold. \u2018Well, there you go,\u2019 he said and instead got up himself. \u2018Bye.\u2019 He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back through the car park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain on his face. There was even, he noticed, a hint of a rainbow glistening over the Devon hills. He enjoyed that too. He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf GTi, squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps and onto the slip road back towards the motorway. He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had closed finally and for ever above his head. He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him. He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, dirty, rainbow hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe. He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things. The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a small umbrella. His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over. \u2018Fenny!\u2019 he shouted. Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her. It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then bowled wildly away across the road. \u2018Shit!\u2019 yelled Arthur as helpfully as he could, leapt out of his own door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKenna\u2019s All Weather Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny\u2019s umbrella instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away. The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy long legs, expiring sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little. He picked it up. \u2018Er,\u2019 he said. There didn\u2019t seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her. \u2018How did you know my name?\u2019 she said. \u2018Er, well,\u2019 he said. \u2018Look, I\u2019ll get you another one...\u2019 He looked at her and tailed off. She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost sombre, like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden. She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at. But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face, and impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was very disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell. She grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into the front seat. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the umbrella,\u2019 she said to him as she climbed in. \u2018It was my brother\u2019s and he can\u2019t have liked it or he wouldn\u2019t have given it to me.\u2019 She laughed and pulled on her seatbelt. \u2018You\u2019re not a friend of my brother\u2019s, are you?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 Her voice was the only part of her which didn\u2019t say \u2018Good\u2019. Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these functions were vital to his driving or they were in trouble. So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother\u2019s car, the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars, had not been the unbalance of the moment, or, if it had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well balanced people are supposed to be balancing on. \u2018So...\u2019 he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start. \u2018He was meant to pick me up \u2013 my brother \u2013 but phoned to say he couldn\u2019t make it. I asked about buses but the man started to look at a calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch. So.\u2019 \u2018So.\u2019 \u2018So here I am. And what I would like to know, is how you know my name.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps we ought to first sort out,\u2019 said Arthur, looking back over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, \u2018where I\u2019m taking you.\u2019 Very close, he hoped, or a long way. Close would mean she lived near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there. \u2018I\u2019d like to go to Taunton,\u2019 she said, \u2018please. If that\u2019s all right. It\u2019s not far. You can drop me at...\u2019 \u2018You live in Taunton?\u2019 he said, hoping that he\u2019d managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully close to him. He could... \u2018No, London,\u2019 she said. \u2018There\u2019s a train in just under an hour.\u2019 It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away up the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering with horror heard himself saying, \u2018Oh, I can take you to London. Let me take you to London...\u2019 Bungling idiot. Why on earth had he said \u2018let\u2019 in that stupid way? He was behaving like a twelve year old. \u2018Are you going to London?\u2019 she asked. \u2018I wasn\u2019t,\u2019 he said, \u2018but...\u2019 Bungling idiot. \u2018It\u2019s very kind of you,\u2019 she said, \u2018but really no. I like to go by train.\u2019 And suddenly she was gone. Or rather, that part of her which brought her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly out of the window and hummed lightly to herself. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he\u2019d blown it. Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction to centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not behave like this. Taunton 5 miles, said the signpost. He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled. He was going to have to do something dramatic. \u2018Fenny,\u2019 he said. She glanced round sharply at him. \u2018You still haven\u2019t told me how...\u2019 \u2018Listen,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I will tell you, though the story is rather strange. Very strange.\u2019 She was still looking at him, but said nothing. \u2018Listen...\u2019 \u2018You said that.\u2019 \u2018Did I? Oh. There are things I must talk to you about, and things I must tell you... a story I must tell you which would...\u2019 He was thrashing about. He wanted something along the lines of \u2018Thy knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine\u2019 but didn\u2019t think he could carry it off and didn\u2019t like the hedgehog reference. \u2018... which would take more than five miles,\u2019 he settled for in the end, rather lamely he was afraid. \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018Just supposing,\u2019 he said, \u2018just supposing\u2019 \u2013 he didn\u2019t know what was coming next, so he thought he\u2019d just sit back and listen \u2013 \u2018that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me, and that, though you didn\u2019t know it, I was very important to you, but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and I was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to someone I\u2019ve only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time, what would you say...\u2019 he paused helplessly, and looked at her, \u2018I... should do?\u2019 \u2018Watch the road!\u2019 she yelped. \u2018Shit!\u2019 He narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred Italian washing machines in a German lorry. \u2018I think,\u2019 she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, \u2018you should buy me a drink before my train goes.\u2019 12 There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of pallor to the pork pies. Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches. There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do. \u2018Make \u2019em dry,\u2019 is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness, \u2018make \u2019em rubbery. If you have to keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing \u2019em once a week.\u2019 It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been. They\u2019re not altogether clear what those sins are, and don\u2019t want to know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about. But whatever sins they are are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat. If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef\u2019s hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone, among his cats on a back stair in Stepney. The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific. \u2018There must be somewhere better,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No time,\u2019 said Fenny, glancing at her watch. \u2018My train leaves in half an hour.\u2019 They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses, and some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got Fenny a tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it. And a couple of sausages. He didn\u2019t know why. He bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass. The barman dunked Arthur\u2019s change in a pool of beer on the bar, for which Arthur thanked him. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Fenny, glancing at her watch, \u2018tell me what it is you have to tell me.\u2019 She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur\u2019s heart sank. Hardly, he felt, the most conducive setting to try to explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a sort of out of body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the Earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, something which he alone on Earth knew anything about, having virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to go to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible. \u2018Fenny,\u2019 he started. \u2018I wonder if you\u2019d like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It\u2019s just a little one.\u2019 He glanced up sharply. \u2018To raise money for Anjie who\u2019s retiring.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018And needs a kidney machine.\u2019 He was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle aged woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot. She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin. \u2018Only ten pence each,\u2019 she said, \u2018so you could probably even buy two. Without breaking the bank!\u2019 She gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously long sigh. Saying \u2018Without breaking the bank\u2019 had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some GIs had been billeted on her in the war. \u2018Er, yes, all right,\u2019 said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins. With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was such a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur. \u2018I do hope you win,\u2019 she said with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami, \u2018the prizes are so nice.\u2019 \u2018Yes, thank you,\u2019 said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch. He turned towards Fenny. So did the woman with the raffle tickets. \u2018And what about you, young lady?\u2019 she said. \u2018It\u2019s for Anjie\u2019s kidney machine. She\u2019s retiring, you see. Yes?\u2019 She hoisted the little smile even further up her face. She would have to stop and let it go soon or the skin would surely split. \u2018Er, look, here you are,\u2019 said Arthur, and pushed a fifty pence piece at her in the hope that that would see her off. \u2018Oh, we are in the money, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 said the woman, with a long smiling sigh. \u2018Down from London, are we?\u2019 Arthur wished she wouldn\u2019t talk so bloody slowly. \u2018No, that\u2019s all right, really,\u2019 he said with a wave of his hand, and she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by one. \u2018Oh, but you must have your tickets,\u2019 insisted the woman, \u2018or you won\u2019t be able to claim your prize. They\u2019re very nice prizes, you know. Very suitable.\u2019 Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he could. The woman turned to Fenny once again. \u2018And now, what about...\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 Arthur nearly yelled. \u2018These are for her,\u2019 he explained, brandishing the five new tickets. \u2018Oh, I see! How nice!\u2019 She smiled sickeningly at both of them. \u2018Well, I do hope you...\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 snapped Arthur, \u2018thank you.\u2019 The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter. He sighed and smiled. \u2018Where were we?\u2019 \u2018You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice. \u2018It\u2019s why I asked if you were a friend of my brother\u2019s. Or half brother, really. He\u2019s the only one who calls me Fenny, and I\u2019m not fond of him for it.\u2019 \u2018So what\u2019s...?\u2019 \u2018Fenchurch.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Fenchurch.\u2019 \u2018Fenchurch.\u2019 She looked at him sternly. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018and I\u2019m watching you like a lynx to see if you\u2019re going to ask the same silly question that everyone asks me till I want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if you do. Plus I shall scream. So watch it.\u2019 She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered at him from behind it. \u2018Oh,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s a little unfair, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Fine.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 she said with a laugh, \u2018you can ask me. Might as well get it over with. Better than have you call me Fenny all the time.\u2019 \u2018Presumably...\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018We\u2019ve only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so generous when I spoke to you before...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 snapped Arthur. The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets was waving the two last ones under his nose. \u2018I thought I\u2019d give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so nice.\u2019 She wrinkled up her nose a little confidentially. \u2018Very tasteful. I know you\u2019ll like them. And it is for Anjie\u2019s retirement present, you see. We want to give her...\u2019 \u2018A kidney machine, yes,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Here.\u2019 He held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the tickets. A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly. You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach. \u2018Oh dear,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u2019 She peered anxiously at both of them. \u2018No, it\u2019s fine,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Everything that could possibly be fine,\u2019 he insisted, \u2018is fine.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he added. \u2018I say,\u2019 she said, in a delighted ecstacy of worry, \u2018you\u2019re not... in love, are you?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s very hard to say,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018We haven\u2019t had a chance to talk yet.\u2019 He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning. The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality. \u2018I\u2019ll let you see the prizes in a minute,\u2019 she said, and left. Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with. \u2018You were about to ask me,\u2019 she said, \u2018a question.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018We can do it together if you like,\u2019 said Fenchurch. \u2018Was I found...\u2019 \u2018... in a handbag...\u2019 joined in Arthur. \u2018... in the Left Luggage Office...\u2019 they said together. \u2018... at Fenchurch Street Station,\u2019 they finished. \u2018And the answer,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018is no.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I was conceived there.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I was con\u2014\u2019 \u2018In the Left Luggage Office?\u2019 hooted Arthur. \u2018No, of course not. Don\u2019t be silly. What would my parents be doing in the Left Luggage Office?\u2019 she said, rather taken aback by the suggestion. \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 spluttered Arthur, \u2018or rather...\u2019 \u2018It was in the ticket queue.\u2019 \u2018The...\u2019 \u2018The ticket queue. Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate. They only say you wouldn\u2019t believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station.\u2019 She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch. Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two. \u2018I\u2019m going to have to go in a minute or two,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018and you haven\u2019t begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest.\u2019 \u2018Why don\u2019t you let me drive you to London?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018It\u2019s Saturday, I\u2019ve got nothing particular to do, I\u2019d...\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018thank you, it\u2019s sweet of you, but no. I need to be by myself for a couple of days.\u2019 She smiled and shrugged. \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018You can tell me another time. I\u2019ll give you my number.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him. \u2018Now we can relax,\u2019 she said with a slow smile which filled Arthur till he thought he would burst. \u2018Fenchurch,\u2019 he said, enjoying the name as he said it. \u2018I\u2014\u2019 \u2018A box,\u2019 said a trailing voice, \u2018of cherry brandy liqueurs, and also, and I know you\u2019ll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe music...\u2019 \u2018Yes, thank you, very nice,\u2019 insisted Arthur. \u2018I just thought I\u2019d let you have a look at them,\u2019 said the permed woman, \u2018as you\u2019re down from London...\u2019 She was holding them out proudly for Arthur to see. He could see that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music. That was what they were. \u2018I\u2019ll let you have your drink in peace now,\u2019 she said, patting Arthur lightly on his seething shoulder, \u2018but I knew you\u2019d like to see.\u2019 Arthur re engaged his eyes with Fenchurch\u2019s once again, and suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come and gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman. \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass, \u2018we will talk again.\u2019 She took a sip. \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 she added, \u2018it wouldn\u2019t have gone so well if it wasn\u2019t for her.\u2019 She gave a wry smile and dropped her hair forward over her face again. It was perfectly true. He had to admit it was perfectly true. 13 That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won. It was eight o\u2019clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her. Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That would be the cool thing to do. Or next week sometime. No. No games. He wanted her and didn\u2019t care who knew it. He definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her, wanted to do more things than there were names for with her. He actually caught himself saying things like \u2018Yippee\u2019 as he pranced ridiculously round the house. Her eyes, her hair, her voice, everything... He stopped. He would put on the record of bagpipe music. Then he would call her. Would he, perhaps, call her first? No. What he would do was this. He would put on the record of bagpipe music. He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of it. Then he would call her. That was the correct order. That was what he would do. He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he did so. He picked up the record. It failed to blow up. He slipped it out of its cover. He opened the record player, he turned on the amp. They both survived. He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc. He sat and listened solemnly to \u2018A Scottish Soldier\u2019. He listened to \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019. He listened to something about some glen or other. He thought about his miraculous lunchtime. They had just been on the point of leaving, when they were distracted by an awful outbreak of \u2018yoo hooing\u2019. The appallingly permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird with a broken wing. Everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some sort of response. They hadn\u2019t listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie was going to be about the \u00a34.30p everyone had helped to raise towards the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs, and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37. Arthur discovered that he had. He glanced angrily at his watch. Fenchurch gave him a push. \u2018Go on,\u2019 she said, \u2018go and get it. Don\u2019t be bad tempered. Give them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went. I\u2019ll want to hear the record. Go on.\u2019 She flicked his arm and left. The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over effusive. It was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music. Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on breaking into laughter. 14 Ring ring. Ring ring. Ring ring. \u2018Hello, yes? Yes, that\u2019s right. Yes. You\u2019ll \u2019ave to speak up, there\u2019s an awful lot of noise in \u2019ere. What? \u2018No, I only do the bar in the evenings. It\u2019s Yvonne who does lunch, and Jim, he\u2019s the landlord. No, I wasn\u2019t on. What? \u2018You\u2019ll have to speak up. \u2018What? No, don\u2019t know anything about no raffle. What? \u2018No, don\u2019t know nothing about it. \u2019Old on! I\u2019ll call Jim.\u2019 The barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the noisy bar. \u2018 \u2019Ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he\u2019s won a raffle. He keeps on saying it\u2019s ticket 37 and he\u2019s won.\u2019 \u2018No, there was a guy in the pub here won,\u2019 shouted back the barman. \u2018He says \u2019ave we got the ticket.\u2019 \u2018Well how can he think he\u2019s won if he hasn\u2019t even got a ticket?\u2019 \u2018Jim says \u2019ow can you think you\u2019ve won if you \u2019aven\u2019t even got the ticket. What?\u2019 She put her hand over the receiver again. \u2018Jim, \u2019e keeps effing and blinding at me. Says there\u2019s a number on the ticket.\u2019 \u2018Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle ticket, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018 \u2019E says \u2019e means it\u2019s a telephone number on the ticket.\u2019 \u2018Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?\u2019 15 Eight hours west sat a man alone on a beach mourning an inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne. He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn\u2019t happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of the sea, and the day was gone. The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los Angeles, which is described in the new edition of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as \u2018junky, wunky, lunky, stunky, and what\u2019s that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo\u2019, and in another, written only hours later, as \u2018being like several thousand square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow.\u2019 The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a \u2018good place to go. It\u2019s very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space traveller. Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying \u201chi\u201d. Until you\u2019ve settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say \u201cno\u201d to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some very strange things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of.\u2019 The hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets are described in the Guide as \u2018Boffo. A good one.\u2019 And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being insane. But this was only, as he would tell people, because he was. One of the many many reasons why people thought him insane was because of the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land where most people\u2019s houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite extreme in its peculiarness. His house was called The Outside of the Asylum. His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be called \u2013 and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to do this \u2013 Wonko the Sane. In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it. We can talk of him much later on \u2013 this is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it. He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting for the end of the world \u2013 little realizing that it had already been and gone. 16 After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone number, Arthur tried everything he could to find Fenchurch, and the more things he tried, the more weeks passed. He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where he\u2019d been just before he met her. \u2018It\u2019s the drizzle that makes me particularly morose.\u2019 \u2018Please shut up about the drizzle,\u2019 snapped Arthur. \u2018I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling.\u2019 \u2018Look...\u2019 \u2018But I\u2019ll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Blatter.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018It will blatter.\u2019 Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he had been driven there by superstition rather than logic. However, as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time. The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man\u2019s exasperating conversation. \u2018I think,\u2019 said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to say this, \u2018that it\u2019s easing off.\u2019 \u2018Ha!\u2019 Arthur just shrugged. He should go. That\u2019s what he should do. He should just go. \u2018It never stops raining!\u2019 ranted the lorry driver. He thumped the table, spilt his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be steaming. You can\u2019t just walk off without responding to a remark like that. \u2018Of course it stops raining,\u2019 said Arthur. It was hardly an elegant refutation, but it had to be said. \u2018It rains... all... the time,\u2019 raved the man, thumping the table again, in time to the words. Arthur shook his head. \u2018Stupid to say it rains all the time...\u2019 he said. The man\u2019s eyebrows shot up, affronted. \u2018Stupid? Why\u2019s it stupid? Why\u2019s it stupid to say it rains all the time if it rains the whole time?\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t rain yesterday.\u2019 \u2018Did in Darlington.\u2019 Arthur paused, warily. \u2018You going to ask me where I was yesterday?\u2019 asked the man. \u2018Eh?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018But I expect you can guess.\u2019 \u2018Do you?\u2019 \u2018Begins with a D.\u2019 \u2018Does it?\u2019 \u2018And it was pissing down there, I can tell you.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t want to sit there, mate,\u2019 said a passing stranger in overalls to Arthur cheerily. \u2018That\u2019s Thundercloud Corner, that is. Reserved special for old Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head here. There\u2019s one reserved in every motorway caff between here and sunny Denmark. Steer clear, is my advice. \u2019S what we all do. How\u2019s it going, Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet weather tyres on? Har har.\u2019 He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to someone at a nearby table. \u2018See, none of them bastards take me seriously,\u2019 said Rob McKenna. \u2018But,\u2019 he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, \u2018they all know it\u2019s true!\u2019 Arthur frowned. \u2018Like my wife,\u2019 hissed the sole owner and driver of McKenna\u2019s All Weather Haulage. \u2018She says it\u2019s nonsense and I make a fuss and complain about nothing, but,\u2019 he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes, \u2018she always brings the washing in when I phone to say I\u2019m on me way home!\u2019 He brandished his coffee spoon. \u2018What do you make of that?\u2019 \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018I have a book,\u2019 he went on, \u2018I have a book. A diary. Kept it for fifteen years. Shows every single place I\u2019ve ever been. Every day. And also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly,\u2019 he snarled, \u2018 \u2019orrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales I been. All round the Continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to Denmark, been to Yugoslavia. It\u2019s all marked in and charted. Even when I went to visit my brother,\u2019 he added, \u2018in Seattle.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, \u2018perhaps you\u2019d better show it to someone.\u2019 \u2018I will,\u2019 said Rob McKenna. And he did. 17 Misery. Dejection. More misery and more dejection. He needed a project and he gave himself one. He would find where his cave had been. On prehistoric Earth he had lived in a cave, not a nice cave, a lousy cave, but... There was no but. It had been a totally lousy cave and he had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years, which made it a home of some kind, and a person likes to keep track of his homes. Arthur Dent was such a person and so he went to Exeter to buy a computer. That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer. But he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was his serious purpose. To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric Earth. He explained this to the man in the shop. \u2018Why?\u2019 said the man in the shop. This was a tricky one. \u2018OK, skip that,\u2019 said the man in the shop. \u2018How?\u2019 \u2018Well, I was hoping you could help me with that.\u2019 The man sighed and his shoulders drooped. \u2018Have you much experience of computers?\u2019 Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard computer on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a second, or Deep Thought, or \u2013 but decided he wouldn\u2019t. \u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018Looks like a fun afternoon,\u2019 said the man in the shop, but he said it only to himself. Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous. Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn\u2019t even know how long it had been, beyond Ford Prefect\u2019s rough guess at the time that it was \u2018a couple of million years\u2019 and he simply didn\u2019t have the maths. Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations and arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result. He would call it the right result. Who would know? As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never know that. He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door. \u2018Oh. I thought you were going to phone me first.\u2019 Arthur gaped in astonishment. \u2018You can only come in for a few minutes,\u2019 said Fenchurch. \u2018I\u2019m just going out.\u2019 18 A summer\u2019s day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique restoring machinery. Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur wandered in a blissed out haze and looked at all the shops which, in Islington, are quite a useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office furniture or fish will readily confirm. The sun beat down over the roof gardens. It beat on architects and plumbers. It beat on barristers and burglars. It beat on pizzas. It beat on estate agents particulars. It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop. \u2018It\u2019s an interesting building,\u2019 said the proprietor, cheerfully. \u2018There\u2019s a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub. It was built for the Prince Regent, apparently, so he could make his escape when he needed to.\u2019 \u2018You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine furniture,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No,\u2019 said the proprietor, \u2018not for that reason.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll have to excuse me,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I\u2019m terribly happy.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of Greenpeace. He remembered the contents of his file marked \u2018Things to do \u2013 urgent!\u2019, which he hadn\u2019t opened again in the meantime. He marched in with a cheery smile and said he\u2019d come to give them some money to help free the dolphins. \u2018Very funny,\u2019 they told him, \u2018go away.\u2019 This wasn\u2019t quite the response he had expected, so he tried again. This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine. Just after six he returned to Fenchurch\u2019s house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne. \u2018Hold this,\u2019 she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand and disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar. The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington. As well as its large stable doors it also had a normal looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood with a black dolphin door knocker. The one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses. An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The other end of the rope held a suspended cello. The door opened above his head. \u2018OK,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018pull on the rope, steady the cello. Pass it up to me.\u2019 He pulled on the rope, he steadied the cello. \u2018I can\u2019t pull on the rope again,\u2019 he said, \u2018without letting go of the cello.\u2019 Fenchurch leant down. \u2018I\u2019m steadying the cello,\u2019 she said. \u2018You pull on the rope.\u2019 The cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside. \u2018Come on up yourself,\u2019 she called down. Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable doors, tingling. The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty rough and full of junk. A large old cast iron mangle stood there, a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner. There was also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books. The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked. And this was the measure of Arthur\u2019s mood as he started up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing. \u2018An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place,\u2019 said Fenchurch chattily as Arthur emerged through the floor. \u2018He keeps on coming round, standing in stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have, therefore, so far failed to happen to it.\u2019 In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated, furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up Stonehenge. There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were interesting. There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could actually swing a cat in. \u2018But,\u2019 she added, \u2018only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didn\u2019t mind a few nasty cracks about the head. So. Here you are.\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 They looked at each other for a moment. The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from. For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel selfconscious if left alone for long enough with a Swiss cheese plant, the moment was one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking. He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise. He hadn\u2019t realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before, which was \u2018Yes\u2019. Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her head. \u2018I know,\u2019 she said. \u2018I shall have to remember,\u2019 she added, \u2018that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it.\u2019 She turned away. \u2018Let\u2019s go for a walk,\u2019 she said quickly. \u2018Hyde Park. I\u2019ll change into something less suitable.\u2019 She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly shapely one, and it didn\u2019t really suit her. \u2018I wear it specially for my cello teacher,\u2019 she said. \u2018He\u2019s a nice old boy, but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited. I\u2019ll be down in a moment.\u2019 She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, \u2018Put the bottle in the fridge for later.\u2019 He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it had an identical twin to sit next to. He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of her dress fall to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort of person he was. He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the blasted things if he had to. He would keep his head down. This he completely, utterly and abjectly failed to do. She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she shook her head, dropped the light sundress down over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom. She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed it and put her head slightly on one side. \u2018Like it?\u2019 she said. \u2018You look gorgeous,\u2019 he said simply, because she did. \u2018Hmmmm,\u2019 she said, as if he hadn\u2019t really answered her question. She closed the upstairs front door, which had stood open all this time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur\u2019s eyes followed hers around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying. Arthur looked back at her. \u2018Ready?\u2019 \u2018Did you know,\u2019 she said with a slightly puzzled smile, \u2018that there\u2019s something wrong with me?\u2019 Her directness caught Arthur unprepared. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019d heard some vague sort of...\u2019 \u2018I wonder how much you do know about me,\u2019 she said. \u2018If you heard from where I think you heard then that\u2019s not it. Russell just sort of makes stuff up, because he can\u2019t deal with what it really is.\u2019 A pang of worry went through Arthur. \u2018Then what is it?\u2019 he said. \u2018Can you tell me?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 she said, \u2018it\u2019s nothing bad at all. Just unusual. Very very unusual.\u2019 She touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him briefly. \u2018I shall be very interested to know,\u2019 she said, \u2018if you manage to work out what it is this evening.\u2019 Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail. 19 Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire. He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier machinery in its vicinity and padding it with towels. He slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. They were claustrophobic and ill lit, and what light there was was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises. That wasn\u2019t it, though. He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty searing screech. That wasn\u2019t it either. He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor, though still ill lit. The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was heavier. A small platoon of robots went by making a terrible clattering. Still not it, though. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he walked along it in the other direction. He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched Perspex. One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system. It was hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly felt very strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down. That wasn\u2019t it, though. He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it. There was nasty blaring music with it too, but that wasn\u2019t it. He came upon another, much larger three dimensional screen that was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship. As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star Xaxis, and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them. That was it. Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on. He yawned and dug his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy out of his satchel. He activated the screen, and flicked idly through some level three entries and some level four entries. He was looking for some good insomnia cures. He found REST, which was what he reckoned he needed. He found REST AND RECUPERATION and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea. He looked up at the monitor screen. The battle was raging more fiercely every second and the noise was appalling. The ship juddered, screamed, and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received. He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his satchel again. He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the Guide. When all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, and went in search of the ship\u2019s computer data banks. 20 \u2018The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the summer, especially in parks,\u2019 said the voice earnestly, \u2018is to make girls\u2019 breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am convinced that this is the case.\u2019 Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment. \u2018And I am certain,\u2019 said the frizzy ginger haired youth with the long thin nose who was expostulating from his deckchair by the side of the Serpentine, \u2018that if one worked the argument through, one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from everything,\u2019 he insisted to his thin dark haired companion who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots, \u2018that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This is indisputable. And,\u2019 he added, \u2018I love it.\u2019 He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at Fenchurch. Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently quaking. \u2018Next guess,\u2019 she said, when she had stopped giggling, \u2018come on.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018your elbow. Your left elbow. There\u2019s something wrong with your left elbow.\u2019 \u2018Wrong again,\u2019 she said, \u2018completely wrong. You\u2019re on completely the wrong track.\u2019 The summer sun was sinking through the trees in the park, looking as if\u2014Let\u2019s not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings. Even the ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a summer\u2019s evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face. It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere. Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused to chase off an American couple who had tried, timidly, to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in. \u2018No!\u2019 he shouted at them. \u2018Go away! I\u2019m only practising.\u2019 He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood. Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards. \u2018I don\u2019t think it can be your bottom,\u2019 he said after a while, \u2018there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with that at all.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 she agreed, \u2018there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom.\u2019 They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the other side of the tree. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you a story,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Good.\u2019 They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks. \u2018A story,\u2019 said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her. \u2018Which will tell something of the sort of things that happen to me. It\u2019s absolutely true. \u2018You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wife\u2019s cousin\u2019s best friend, but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line. \u2018Well, it\u2019s like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually happened to was me.\u2019 \u2018Like the raffle ticket.\u2019 Arthur laughed. \u2018Yes. I had a train to catch,\u2019 he went on. \u2018I arrived at the station\u2014\u2019 \u2018Did I ever tell you,\u2019 interrupted Fenchurch, \u2018what happened to my parents in a station?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you did.\u2019 \u2018Just checking.\u2019 Arthur glanced at his watch. \u2018I suppose we could think of getting back,\u2019 he said. \u2018Tell me the story,\u2019 said Fenchurch firmly. \u2018You arrived at the station.\u2019 \u2018I was about twenty minutes early. I\u2019d got the time of the train wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible,\u2019 he added after a moment\u2019s reflection, \u2018that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong. Hadn\u2019t occurred to me before.\u2019 \u2018Get on with it.\u2019 Fenchurch laughed. \u2018So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.\u2019 \u2018You do the crossword?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Which one?\u2019 \u2018The Guardian usually.\u2019 \u2018I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer The Times. Did you solve it?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018The crossword in the Guardian.\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it yet,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019m still trying to buy the coffee.\u2019 \u2018All right, then. Buy the coffee.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m buying it. I am also,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018buying some biscuits.\u2019 \u2018What sort?\u2019 \u2018Rich Tea.\u2019 \u2018Good choice.\u2019 \u2018I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table. And don\u2019t ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can\u2019t remember. It was probably round.\u2019 \u2018All right.\u2019 \u2018So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.\u2019 \u2018I see it perfectly.\u2019 \u2018What you don\u2019t see,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018because I haven\u2019t mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting there opposite me.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s he like?\u2019 \u2018Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn\u2019t look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018as if he was about to do anything weird.\u2019 \u2018Ah. I know the type. What did he do?\u2019 \u2018He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Ate it.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018He ate it.\u2019 Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. \u2018What on earth did you do?\u2019 \u2018Well, in the circumstances I did what any red blooded Englishman would do. I was compelled,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018to ignore it.\u2019 \u2018What? Why?\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s not the sort of thing you\u2019re trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.\u2019 \u2018Well, you could...\u2019 Fenchurch thought about it. \u2018I must say I\u2019m not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?\u2019 \u2018I stared furiously at the crossword,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Couldn\u2019t do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,\u2019 he added, \u2018that the packet was already mysteriously open...\u2019 \u2018But you\u2019re fighting back, taking a tough line.\u2019 \u2018After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit,\u2019 Arthur said, \u2018it stays eaten.\u2019 \u2018So what did he do?\u2019 \u2018Took another one. Honestly,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018this is exactly what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground.\u2019 Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably. \u2018And the problem was,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around. What do you say? \u201cExcuse me... I couldn\u2019t help noticing, er...\u201d Doesn\u2019t work. No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigour than previously.\u2019 \u2018My man...\u2019 \u2018Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn\u2019t budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St Crispin\u2019s Day...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I went into the breach again. I took,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018another biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met.\u2019 \u2018Like this?\u2019 \u2018Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that there was a little electricity in the air. There was a little tension building up over the table. At about this time.\u2019 \u2018I can imagine.\u2019 \u2018We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me...\u2019 \u2018The whole packet?\u2019 \u2018Well, it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.\u2019 \u2018Gladiators,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018would have had to do it in the sun. More physically gruelling.\u2019 \u2018There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I heaved a sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper...\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Were my biscuits.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Fenchurch. \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018True.\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing. She sat up again. \u2018You complete nitwit,\u2019 she hooted, \u2018you almost completely and utterly foolish person.\u2019 She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled off again. He was surprised at how light she was. \u2018Now you tell me a story.\u2019 \u2018I thought,\u2019 she said putting on a low husky voice, \u2018that you were very keen to get back.\u2019 \u2018No hurry,\u2019 he said airily, \u2018I want you to tell me a story.\u2019 She looked out over the lake and pondered. \u2018All right,\u2019 she said, \u2018it\u2019s only a short one. And not funny like yours, but... Anyway.\u2019 She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting. Arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business. \u2018When I was a kid,\u2019 she said. \u2018These sort of stories always start like this, don\u2019t they, \u201cWhen I was a kid....\u201d Anyway. This is the bit where the girl suddenly says, \u201cWhen I was a kid\u201d and starts to unburden herself. We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed... What do you think of it so far?\u2019 \u2018I like it. I think it\u2019s moving well. You\u2019re getting the bedroom interest in nice and early. We could probably do with some development with the picture.\u2019 \u2018It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like,\u2019 she said, \u2018but don\u2019t. Full of endearing little animals doing endearing things, you know?\u2019 \u2018I know. I was plagued with them too. Rabbits in waistcoats.\u2019 \u2018Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats and owls. There may even have been a reindeer.\u2019 \u2018On the raft.\u2019 \u2018On the raft. And a boy was sitting on the raft.\u2019 \u2018Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer.\u2019 \u2018Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety.\u2019 \u2018Ugh.\u2019 \u2018The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it who shouldn\u2019t even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time. Worried me. Not badly, but just vaguely, all the time. \u2018Then one day \u2013 and remember I\u2019d been looking at this picture every night for years \u2013 I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail. Never seen it before. The otter was fine, he was just swimming along.\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018Good story?\u2019 she said. \u2018Ends weakly,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018leaves the audience crying \u201cYes, but what of it?\u201d Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before the credits.\u2019 Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs. \u2018It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being watered. The sudden shift of perspective that says, \u201cPut away your worries, the world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact very easy.\u201d You probably think I\u2019m saying that because I\u2019m going to say that I felt like that this afternoon or something, don\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Well, I...\u2019 said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered. \u2018Well, it\u2019s all right,\u2019 she said, \u2018I did. That\u2019s exactly what I felt. But you see, I\u2019ve felt that before, even stronger. Incredibly strongly. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a bit of a one,\u2019 she said, gazing off into the distance, \u2018for sudden startling revelations.\u2019 Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, for the moment not to try. \u2018It was very odd,\u2019 she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side. \u2018Very odd,\u2019 she repeated, \u2018for days before, the strangest feeling had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. No, it wasn\u2019t like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected into something, bit by bit. No, not even that; it was as if the whole of the Earth, through me, was going to...\u2019 \u2018Does the number,\u2019 said Arthur gently, \u2018forty two mean anything to you at all?\u2019 \u2018What? No, what are you talking about?\u2019 exclaimed Fenchurch. \u2018Just a thought,\u2019 murmured Arthur. \u2018Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious.\u2019 \u2018I was being perfectly serious,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018It\u2019s just the Universe I\u2019m never quite sure about.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 \u2018Tell me the rest of it,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t worry if it sounds odd. Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff,\u2019 he added, \u2018that is odd. And I don\u2019t mean biscuits.\u2019 She nodded, and seemed to believe him. Suddenly, she gripped his arm. \u2018It was so simple,\u2019 she said, \u2018so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple, when it came.\u2019 \u2018What was it?\u2019 said Arthur quietly. \u2018Arthur, you see,\u2019 she said, \u2018that\u2019s what I no longer know. And the loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it, it all goes flickery and jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the teacup and I just black out.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Well, like your story,\u2019 she said, \u2018the best bit happened in a caf\u00e9. I was sitting there, having a cup of tea. This was after days of this build up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I think I was buzzing gently. And there was some work going on at a building site opposite the caf\u00e9, and I was watching it through the window, over the rim of my teacup, which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people working. And suddenly, there it was in my mind, this message from somewhere. And it was so simple. It made such sense of everything. I just sat up and thought, \u201cOh! Oh, well that\u2019s all right, then.\u201d I was so startled I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it. Yes,\u2019 she added thoughtfully, \u2018I\u2019m sure I did. How much sense am I making?\u2019 \u2018It was fine up to the bit about the teacup.\u2019 She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it, which is what she was trying to do. \u2018Well, that\u2019s it,\u2019 she said. \u2018Fine up to the bit about the teacup. That was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded.\u2019 \u2018What...?\u2019 \u2018I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 3D with 16 track Dolby Stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with shark movies. It was as if the ground was literally ripped from under my feet, and... and...\u2019 She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say. \u2018And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I\u2019ve been in and out ever since. And that\u2019s why I have an instinctive nervousness,\u2019 she said, \u2018of sudden startling revelations that everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u2019 She looked up at him. Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked \u2018Things to think about \u2013 Urgent.\u2019 \u2018Here is the world,\u2019 he had told himself. \u2018Here, for whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays. With me on it.\u2019 But now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the car when Fenchurch\u2019s brother had told him the silly stories of the CIA agent in the reservoir. The French Embassy went swimmy. The trees went swimmy. The lake went swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on it. The geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to. \u2018Anyway,\u2019 said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide eyed smile, \u2018there is something wrong with part of me, and you\u2019ve got to find out what it is. We\u2019ll go home.\u2019 Arthur shook his head. \u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 she said. Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world\u2019s great suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him. \u2018I\u2019m just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you say you felt as if the Earth actually... exploded...\u2019 \u2018Yes. More than felt.\u2019 \u2018Which is what everybody else says,\u2019 he said hesitantly, \u2018is hallucinations?\u2019 \u2018Yes, but Arthur, that\u2019s ridiculous. People think that if you just say \u201challucinations\u201d it explains anything you want it to explain and eventually whatever it is you can\u2019t understand will just go away. It\u2019s just a word, it doesn\u2019t explain anything. It doesn\u2019t explain why the dolphins disappeared.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No,\u2019 he added thoughtfully. \u2018No,\u2019 he added again, even more thoughtfully. \u2018What?\u2019 he said at last. \u2018Doesn\u2019t explain the dolphins disappearing.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?\u2019 \u2018What do you mean which dolphins? I\u2019m talking about when all the dolphins disappeared.\u2019 She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back, and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him. \u2018The dolphins?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018All the dolphins,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018disappeared?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018The dolphins? You\u2019re saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is this,\u2019 said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, \u2018what you\u2019re saying?\u2019 \u2018Arthur, where have you been, for Heaven\u2019s sake? The dolphins all disappeared on the same day I...\u2019 She stared him intently in his startled eyes. \u2018What...?\u2019 \u2018No dolphins. All gone. Vanished.\u2019 She searched his face. \u2018Did you really not know that?\u2019 It was clear from his startled expression that he did not. \u2018Where did they go?\u2019 he asked. \u2018No one knows. That\u2019s what vanished means.\u2019 She paused. \u2018Well, there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he lives in California,\u2019 she said, \u2018and is mad. I was thinking of going to see him because it seems the only lead I\u2019ve got on what happened to me.\u2019 She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly. She laid her hand on the side of his face. \u2018I really would like to know where you\u2019ve been,\u2019 she said. \u2018I think something terrible happened to you then as well. And that\u2019s why we recognized each other.\u2019 She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018now you\u2019ve got someone you can tell.\u2019 Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh. \u2018It is,\u2019 he said, \u2018a very long story.\u2019 Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag. \u2018Is it anything to do with this?\u2019 she said. The thing she took out of her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of Kakrafoon, half buried in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in large friendly letters, the words DON\u2019T PANIC. \u2018Where did you get this?\u2019 said Arthur, startled, taking it from her. \u2018Ah,\u2019 she said, \u2018I thought it was yours. In Russell\u2019s car that night. You dropped it. Have you been to many of these places?\u2019 Arthur drew The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy from its cover. It was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer. He tapped some buttons till the screen flared with text. \u2018A few,\u2019 he said. \u2018Can we go to them?\u2019 \u2018What? No,\u2019 said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented warily. \u2018Do you want to?\u2019 he said, hoping for the answer no. It was an act of great generosity on his part not to say, \u2018You don\u2019t want to, do you?\u2019 which expects it. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said. \u2018I want to know what the message was that I lost, and where it came from. Because I don\u2019t think,\u2019 she added, standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park, \u2018that it came from here.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not even sure,\u2019 she further added, slipping her arm around Arthur\u2019s waist, \u2018that I know where here is.\u2019 21 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing. It is, essentially, as the title implies, a guide book. The problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable proportion of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this. The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem. This is: Change. Read it through again and you\u2019ll get it. The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so much of it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing. A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong. Where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all the editors the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the meanings of the words \u2018scrupulous\u2019, \u2018conscientious\u2019 or \u2018diligent\u2019, and tends to get his nightmares through a straw. Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub Etha Net according to if they read good. Take for example, the case of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars, famed in myth, legend and stultifyingly dull tri D mini serieses as home of the magnificent and magical Fuolornis Fire Dragon. In Ancient days, before the Advent of the Sorth of Bragadox, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but everyone somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone\u2019s guess, virgins, it was not possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars without hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis Fire Dragons. Whether you would want to do that is another matter. Not that Fire Dragons weren\u2019t an essentially peace loving species, because they were. They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the one one loves, especially if one is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence. Another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well. Add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons. But did they mind? They did not. Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No. The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars for their savage beauty, their noble ways and their habit of biting people who didn\u2019t revere them. Why was this? The answer was simple. Sex. There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost unbearably sexy about having huge fire breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side. Why this should be so, the romance besotted people of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk winged leather bodied Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon than half the people of Brequinda were scurrying off into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins. Pheromones, some researchers said. Something sonic, others claimed. The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it. Not surprisingly, the Guide\u2019s graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular amongst hitchhikers who allow themselves to be guided by it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it is therefore left to latter day travellers to find out for themselves that today\u2019s modern Brequinda in the City State of Avalars is now little more than concrete, strip joints and Dragon Burger Bars. 22 The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant. There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the alley, but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed. Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their American Hots with extra anchovy they could always have sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is now known to have much the same effect. \u2018No,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018not yet.\u2019 Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions, very close to the open bottle of champagne. \u2018No,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018not till you\u2019ve found out what\u2019s wrong with me, which bit. But I suppose,\u2019 she added, very, very, very quietly, \u2018that we may as well start with where your hand is now.\u2019 Arthur said, \u2018So which way do I go?\u2019 \u2018Down,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018on this occasion.\u2019 He moved his hand. \u2018Down,\u2019 she said, \u2018is in fact the other way.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes.\u2019 Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer \u2013 which is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadn\u2019t yet got to that bit, but there will be too much else going on when it does, and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now while things are still moving slowly. \u2018And so we come,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018to your knee. There is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee.\u2019 \u2018My left knee,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018is absolutely fine.\u2019 \u2018So it is.\u2019 \u2018Did you know that...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Ahm, it\u2019s all right, I can tell you do. No, keep going.\u2019 \u2018So it has to be something to do with your feet...\u2019 She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in the Universe, on Squornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being wriggled against, particularly if it\u2019s noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move, it\u2019s a pity they weren\u2019t there. They weren\u2019t, but such is life. Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully. All kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point. \u2018I have to admit,\u2019 he said, \u2018that I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll know when you find it,\u2019 she said. \u2018Really you will.\u2019 There was a slight catch in her voice. \u2018It\u2019s not that one.\u2019 Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on to the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot. She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would know made it impossible not to do this. Then she gave him her right foot. He stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along her instep, could find nothing wrong with it. She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her head. \u2018No, don\u2019t stop,\u2019 she said, \u2018but it\u2019s not that one now.\u2019 Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor. \u2018Don\u2019t stop.\u2019 He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under her toes, along her instep and said, \u2018You mean it\u2019s something to do with which leg I\u2019m holding...?\u2019 She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from Squornshellous Beta. He frowned. \u2018Pick me up,\u2019 she said quietly. He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up. So did she. He picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on for a while, then she said, \u2018Now put me down again.\u2019 Still puzzled, he did so. \u2018Well?\u2019 She looked at him almost challengingly. \u2018So what\u2019s wrong with my feet?\u2019 she said. Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it were, in their normal habitat. And as he looked closely, something odd struck him. He put his head right down to the ground and peered. There was a long pause. He sat back heavily. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I see what\u2019s wrong with your feet. They don\u2019t touch the ground.\u2019 \u2018So... so what do you think...?\u2019 Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling. \u2018What do...\u2019 she stammered. \u2018Are you...?\u2019 She shook the hair forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears. He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single kiss. \u2018Perhaps you can do what I can do,\u2019 he said, and walked straight out of her upstairs front door. The record got to the good bit. 23 The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis. Hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Xaxisian ship was able to deploy. Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it. The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle. All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the ship was gone. With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space quickly, effortlessly, and above all, quietly. Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old haunts. He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York. In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side, beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding welfare and voting rights. One of these now floated past, waving. Ford waved back. The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank. \u2018Hi,\u2019 it said, \u2018I\u2019ve just been created. I\u2019m completely new to the Universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?\u2019 \u2018Phew,\u2019 said Ford, a little nonplussed, \u2018I can tell you where some bars are, I guess.\u2019 \u2018What about love and happiness. I sense deep needs for things like that,\u2019 it said, waving its tentacles. \u2018Got any leads there?\u2019 \u2018You can get something like what you require,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018on Seventh Avenue.\u2019 \u2018I instinctively feel,\u2019 said the creature, urgently, \u2018that I need to be beautiful. Am I?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re pretty direct, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018No point in mucking about. Am I?\u2019 The thing was oozing all over the place now, squelching and blubbering. A nearby wino was getting interested. \u2018To me?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018No. But listen,\u2019 he added after a moment, \u2018most people make out, you know. Are there any like you down there?\u2019 \u2018Search me, buster,\u2019 said the creature, \u2018as I said, I\u2019m new here. Life is entirely strange to me. What\u2019s it like?\u2019 Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with authority. \u2018Life,\u2019 he said, \u2018is like a grapefruit.\u2019 \u2018Er, how so?\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s sort of orangey yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy in the middle. It\u2019s got pips inside too. Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast.\u2019 \u2018Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?\u2019 \u2018I expect so,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Ask a policeman.\u2019 Deep in his bunk, Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side. It wasn\u2019t his favourite type of dream because it didn\u2019t have Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple Breasted Whore of Eroticon Six, in it, whom many of his dreams did feature. But at least it was a dream. At least he was asleep. 24 Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur hadn\u2019t done this sort of thing for a while, at least, not deliberately, and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it. He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didn\u2019t. A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it. The ground was hanging menacingly above his head. He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldn\u2019t at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests, so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of general well disposedness towards things, and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasn\u2019t touching anything. A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway. After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the ground. \u2018Arthur...\u2019 The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall away from it, which is what he did. Slowly. Very very slowly. As he fell slowly, very very slowly, he closed his eyes \u2013 carefully, so as not to jolt anything. The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he slowly, very very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind the other. That should sort the ground out. He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very very slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes. He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until all the birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different. Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things, being in the air. Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street. Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in. He was, therefore, safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity. He slowly, very very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her upstairs doorway. Her face was inches from his. \u2018I was about to ask you,\u2019 she said in a low trembly voice, \u2018what you were doing. But then I realized that I could see what you were doing. You were flying. So it seemed,\u2019 she went on after a slight wondering pause, \u2018like a bit of a silly question.\u2019 Arthur said, \u2018Can you do it?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Would you like to try?\u2019 She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just in sheer bewilderment. She was shaking like a leaf. \u2018It\u2019s quite easy,\u2019 urged Arthur, \u2018if you don\u2019t know how. That\u2019s the important bit. Be not at all sure how you\u2019re doing it.\u2019 Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley, fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a breath of wind. \u2018Ask me how I did that.\u2019 \u2018How... did you do that?\u2019 \u2018No idea. Not a clue.\u2019 She shrugged in bewilderment. \u2018So how can I...?\u2019 Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand. \u2018I want you to try,\u2019 he said, \u2018to step on to my hand. Just one foot.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Try it.\u2019 Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying to step on to the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in midair, she stepped on to his hand. \u2018Now the other.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Take the weight off your back foot.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Try it.\u2019 \u2018Like this?\u2019 \u2018Like that.\u2019 Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if\u2014She stopped telling herself what what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didn\u2019t altogether want to know. She fixed her eyes very very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody, and didn\u2019t think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn\u2019t standing on anything at all. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018take your weight off your left foot.\u2019 She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company who had their offices round the corner, and took her weight off her left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018take the weight off your right foot.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Try.\u2019 She hadn\u2019t seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it looked to her now as if, as well as the mud and gunge up there, there might also be a bird\u2019s nest. If she leaned forward just a little and took her weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly. Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn\u2019t want to get involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up. He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys and habitually didn\u2019t expect to find their owners hovering several feet above them. He was relaxed by both these habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way. Arthur let out a long held breath. \u2018See what a piece of eggshell I have found you,\u2019 said Fenchurch in his ear. 25 Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may have received an impression of his character and habits which, while it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the truth, falls somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects. And the reasons for this are obvious. Editing, selection, the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance. Like this, for instance. \u2018Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor. He put on his pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe. He washed his face and hands, cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory, realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again and went to bed. He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night, then he turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep. \u2018It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour. \u2018After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left side. And so he whiled the night away, sleeping. \u2018At four he got up and went to the lavatory again. He opened the door to the lavatory...\u2019 and so on. It\u2019s guff. It doesn\u2019t advance the action. It makes for nice fat books such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn\u2019t actually get you anywhere. You don\u2019t, in short, want to know. But there are other omissions as well, beside the teeth cleaning and trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested. What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings with Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere? To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business. And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet Krikkit? Just because the planet didn\u2019t have Fuolornis Fire Dragons or Dire Straits doesn\u2019t mean that everyone just sat up every night reading. Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the committee meeting party on Prehistoric Earth, when Arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet Golgafrincham? What then? What happened next? And the answer is, of course, that the book ended. The next one didn\u2019t resume the story till five years later, and you can, claim some, take discretion too far. \u2018This Arthur Dent,\u2019 comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the Galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate, \u2018what is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?\u2019 Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it. 26 Arthur Dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think, as they drifted up, that he very much hoped that his friends who had always found him pleasant but dull, or more latterly, odd but dull, were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last time, for a while, that he thought of them. They drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the other way. And as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do. Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out towards the Westway flyover, on keeping the street lights lit and on making sure that when somebody on Baker Street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground. Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of lights of London \u2013 London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the strangely coloured fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy, lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them, but London \u2013 swayed, swaying and turning, turned. \u2018Try a swoop,\u2019 he called to Fenchurch. \u2018What?\u2019 Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty air. It was breathy and faint with disbelief \u2013 all those things, clear, faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time. \u2018We\u2019re flying...\u2019 she said. \u2018A trifle,\u2019 called Arthur, \u2018think nothing of it. Try a swoop.\u2019 \u2018A sw\u2014\u2019 Her hand caught his, and in a second her weight caught it too, and stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing wildly at nothing. Physics glanced at Arthur, and clotted with horror he was gone too, sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but his voice. They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn\u2019t do this sort of thing here. He couldn\u2019t catch her because this was London, and not a million miles from here, seven hundred and fiftysix, to be exact, in Pisa, Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fall at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights. They fell. Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the Italians had to say about physics when they couldn\u2019t even keep a simple tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and damn well did fall faster than Fenchurch. He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her shoulders. He got it. Fine. They were now falling together, which was all very sweet and romantic, but didn\u2019t solve the basic problem, which was that they were falling, and the ground wasn\u2019t waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to meet them like an express train. He couldn\u2019t support her weight, he hadn\u2019t anything he could support it with or against. The only thing he could think was that they were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than the obvious. Here he felt he was on familiar territory. He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face to him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with his little finger and swung her back upwards, tumbling clumsily up after her. \u2018Shit,\u2019 she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on up into the night. Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had impossibly come. The ground was something not to regard with any too firm or steady an eye, but merely to glance at, as it were, in passing. Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her, and this is where readers who are keen to know what Marvin and Ford Prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later chapters, because Arthur now could wait no longer and helped her take it off. It drifted down and away, whipped by the wind until it was a speck which finally vanished, and for various complicated reasons revolutionized the life of a family in Hounslow, over whose washing line it was discovered draped in the morning. In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little scratchy Perspex window while somebody else\u2019s son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt. Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin. They felt, even Fenchurch, now protected from the elements by only a couple of fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going to let the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle. The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch rose now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very very slowly, which is the only way it\u2019s possible to do it when you\u2019re flying and also not using your hands, went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from top to bottom, Isleworth and Richmond. They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it, Fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool, they found that above the clouds is where the night gets seriously moonlit. The light is darkly brilliant. There are different mountains up there, but they are mountains, with their own white arctic snows. They had emerged at the top of the high stacked cumulo nimbus, and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch eased Arthur in turn from his clothes, prised him free of them till all were gone, winding their surprised way down into the enveloping whiteness. She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T shape, which might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one flown past, replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a little. There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the Greater Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the Constellation Fraz, and unlike the Boeing 747 which is in plentiful supply, they are sadly extinct, and the Universe shall never know their like again. The reason that a Boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or two later. They are big things, terrifyingly big. You know when one is in the air with you. There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and Fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in the Blitz. This time, however, there was no heart sickening fall or loss of nerve, a re grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise. Mrs E. Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts was an elderly lady, indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end. She had seen a lot of it, been puzzled by some, but, she was a little uneasy to feel at this late stage, bored by too much. It had all been very pleasant, but perhaps a little too explicable, a little too routine. With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and looked out over the wing. At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then she thought no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and her alone. By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the wing and tumbled into the slip stream she had cheered up an awful lot. She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong. * * * The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored. The following night they did it all over again, only this time with Sony Walkmen. 27 \u2018This is all very wonderful,\u2019 said Fenchurch a few days later. \u2018But I do need to know what has happened to me. You see, there\u2019s this difference between us. That you lost something and found it again, and I found something and lost it. I need to find it again.\u2019 She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day of telephoning. Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages and big print. It would be pleasant to be able to say that he was none the worse for this, but sadly, this was not the case. He happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so Arthur phoned him anyway. \u2018Arthur, my old soup spoon, my old silver tureen, how particularly stunning to hear from you. Someone told me you\u2019d gone off into space or something.\u2019 Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able to speak or even to follow. Hardly any of it meant anything at all. The bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalanche of nonsense. The time when you did find out, later, which bits he did mean, was often a bad time for all concerned. \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Just a rumour, my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card table, just a rumour. Probably means nothing at all, but I may need a quote from you.\u2019 \u2018Nothing to say, just pub talk.\u2019 \u2018We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it. Plus it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week, so it could be just to have you denying it. Excuse me, something has just fallen out of my ear.\u2019 There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken. \u2018Just remembered,\u2019 he said, \u2018what an odd evening I had last night. Anyway my old, I won\u2019t say what, how do you feel about having ridden on Halley\u2019s Comet?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t,\u2019 said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, \u2018ridden on Halley\u2019s Comet.\u2019 \u2018OK. How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley\u2019s Comet?\u2019 \u2018Pretty relaxed, Murray.\u2019 There was a pause while Murray wrote this down. \u2018Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and the chickens. Fits in with the general weirdness of the week. Week of the Weirdos, we\u2019re thinking of calling it. Good, eh?\u2019 \u2018Very good.\u2019 \u2018Got a ring to it. First we have this man it always rains on.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the absolute stocking top truth. All documented in his little black book, it all checks out at every single fun loving level. The Met Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds. This man is the bee\u2019s knees, Arthur, he is the wasp\u2019s nipples. He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world. We\u2019re calling him the Rain God. Nice, eh?\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019ve met him.\u2019 \u2018Good ring to it. What did you say?\u2019 \u2018I may have met him. Complains all the time, yes?\u2019 \u2018Incredible! You met the Rain God?\u2019 \u2018If it\u2019s the same guy. I told him to stop complaining and show someone his book.\u2019 There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson\u2019s end of the phone. \u2018Well, you did a bundle. An absolute bundle has absolutely been done by you. Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean forget irrigating the Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a whole new career ahead of him, just avoiding places for money. The man\u2019s turning into a monster, Arthur, we might even have to make him win the bingo. \u2018Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who Made the Rain God Rain. Got a ring to it, eh?\u2019 \u2018A nice one, but...\u2019 \u2018We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but that\u2019ll be OK. Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Er, I\u2019m in Islington. Listen, Murray...\u2019 \u2018Islington!\u2019 \u2018Yes...\u2019 \u2018Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real seriously loopy stuff. You know anything about these flying people?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018You must have. This is the real seethingly crazy one. This is the real meatballs in the batter. Locals are phoning in all the time to say there\u2019s this couple who go flying nights. We\u2019ve got guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine photograph. You must have heard.\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote. But that was months ago. Listen, it\u2019s night after night this week, my old cheesegrater, right on your patch. This couple just fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff. And I don\u2019t mean looking through walls or pretending to be box girder bridges. You don\u2019t know anything?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Arthur, it\u2019s been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with you, chumbum, but I have to go. I\u2019ll send the guy with the camera and the hose. Give me the address, I\u2019m ready and writing.\u2019 \u2018Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something.\u2019 \u2018I have a lot to do.\u2019 \u2018I just wanted to find out something about the dolphins.\u2019 \u2018No story. Last year\u2019s news. Forget \u2019em. They\u2019re gone.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s important.\u2019 \u2018Listen, no one will touch it. You can\u2019t sustain a story, you know, when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever it is the story\u2019s about. Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays. Maybe they\u2019ll run a little \u201cWhatever Happened to \u2018Whatever Happened to the Dolphins\u2019\u201d story in a couple of years, around August. But what\u2019s anybody going to do now? \u201cDolphins Still Gone\u201d? \u201cContinuing Dolphin Absence\u201d? \u201cDolphins \u2013 Further Days Without Them\u201d? The story dies, Arthur. It lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat.\u2019 \u2018Murray, I\u2019m not interested in whether it\u2019s a story. I just want to find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California who claims to know something about it. I thought you might know.\u2019 28 \u2018People are beginning to talk,\u2019 said Fenchurch that evening, after they had hauled her cello in. \u2018Not only talk,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018but print, in big bold letters under the bingo prizes. Which is why I thought I\u2019d better get these.\u2019 He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets. \u2018Arthur!\u2019 she said, hugging him. \u2018Does that mean you managed to talk to him?\u2019 \u2018I have had a day,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018of extreme telephonic exhaustion. I have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in Fleet Street, and I finally tracked his number down.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve obviously been working hard, you\u2019re drenched with sweat, poor darling.\u2019 \u2018Not with sweat,\u2019 said Arthur wearily. \u2018A photographer\u2019s just been. I tried to argue, but \u2013 never mind, the point is, yes.\u2019 \u2018You spoke to him.\u2019 \u2018I spoke to his wife. She said he was too weird to come to the phone right now and could I call back.\u2019 He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went to the fridge to find it. \u2018Want a drink?\u2019 \u2018Would commit murder to get one. I always know I\u2019m in for a tough time when my cello teacher looks me up and down and says, \u201cAh yes, my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.\u201d \u2019 \u2018I called again,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018and she said that he was 3.2 light years from the phone and I should call back.\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 \u2018I called again. She said the situation had improved. He was now a mere 2.6 light years from the phone but it was still a long way to shout.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t suppose,\u2019 said Fenchurch, doubtfully, \u2018that there\u2019s anyone else we can talk to?\u2019 \u2018It gets worse,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I spoke to someone on a science magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson will not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof, often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl footwear, that the month\u2019s most fashionable silly theory is true. For people who question the validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and that\u2019s as far as you get.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t realize it was that bad,\u2019 said Fenchurch quietly. She fiddled listlessly with the tickets. \u2018I phoned Mrs Watson again,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Her name, by the way, and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m glad you see. I thought you mightn\u2019t believe any of this, so when I called her this time I used the telephone answering machine to record the call.\u2019 He went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which was particularly recommended by Which? magazine and is almost impossible to use without going mad. \u2018Here it is,\u2019 he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow. The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite and back, but was also hauntingly calm. \u2018Perhaps I should explain,\u2019 Arcane Jill Watson\u2019s voice said, \u2018that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into. It\u2019s in the Asylum, you see. Wonko the Sane does not like to enter the Asylum and so he does not. I feel you should know this because it may save you phoning. If you would like to meet him, this is very easily arranged. All you have to do is walk in. He will only meet people outside the Asylum.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s voice, at its most mystified: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Where is the asylum?\u2019 \u2018Where is the Asylum?\u2019 Arcane Jill Watson again. \u2018Have you ever read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?\u2019 On the tape, Arthur\u2019s voice had to admit that he had not. \u2018You may want to do that. You may find that it clarifies things for you a little. You may find that it indicates to you where the Asylum is. Thank you.\u2019 The sound of the phone line went dead. Arthur turned the machine off. \u2018Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation,\u2019 he said with a shrug. \u2018I actually managed to get the address from the guy on the science magazine.\u2019 Fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and looked at the tickets again. \u2018Do you think it\u2019s worth it?\u2019 she said. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018the one thing that everyone I spoke to agreed on, apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad, is that he does know more than any man living about dolphins.\u2019 29 \u2018This is an important announcement. This is flight 121 to Los Angeles. If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles, now would be the perfect time to disembark.\u2019 30 They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that rents out cars that other people have thrown away. \u2018Getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem,\u2019 said the guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys, \u2018sometimes it\u2019s simpler just to get out and find a car that\u2019s going in that direction.\u2019 They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by. \u2018Everyone there is either English or odd or both. They\u2019ve got a swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers.\u2019 It was true. There was one and that was exactly what he was doing. The garage attendant didn\u2019t think much of their car, but that was fine because they didn\u2019t either. Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San Fernando Valley. They agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didn\u2019t touch any other part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle. As dramatic seas of light went, it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they didn\u2019t think much of it. They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was stupidly hot. They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at. \u2018Someone told me,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018that they once overheard two old ladies on this beach, doing what we\u2019re doing, looking at the Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives. And apparently, after a long pause, one of them said to the other, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not as big as I expected.\u201d \u2019 Their mood gradually lifted as they walked along the beach in Malibu and watched all the millionaires in their chic shanty huts carefully keeping an eye on each other to check how rich they were each getting. Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city like Los Angeles in front of, they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didn\u2019t even mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations, and those simultaneously. So what, they were both playing good rock and roll. \u2018I know that he will be able to help us,\u2019 said Fenchurch determinedly. \u2018I know he will. What\u2019s his name again, that he likes to be called?\u2019 \u2018Wonko the Sane.\u2019 \u2018I know that he will be able to help us.\u2019 Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth, whatever this Earth might prove to be. He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine, that he would not be called upon to try and remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at him. * * * In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed to be a converted warehouse. Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious. Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry. He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her. \u2018Why\u2019s this fish so bloody good?\u2019 he demanded, angrily. \u2018Please excuse my friend,\u2019 said Fenchurch to the startled waitress. \u2018I think he\u2019s having a nice day at last.\u2019 31 If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something which didn\u2019t exactly look like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar. He was tall and he gangled. When he sat in his deckchair gazing at the Pacific, not so much with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he began, and you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off. But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable. It seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you, but which, when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order on his face, made you suddenly feel, \u2018Oh. Well, that\u2019s all right, then.\u2019 When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made you feel like that pretty often. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018they come and see me. They sit right here. They sit right where you\u2019re sitting.\u2019 He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl sandals. \u2018They eat nachos which they say they can\u2019t get where they come from. They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things.\u2019 \u2018Do they?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Are they? So, er... when is this, then? When do they come?\u2019 He gazed out at the Pacific as well. There were little sandpipers running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had just washed over, but they couldn\u2019t bear to get their feet wet. To deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if they\u2019d been constructed by somebody very clever in Switzerland. Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers. \u2018Weekends, mostly,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018on little scooters. They are great machines.\u2019 He smiled. \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I see.\u2019 A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at her. She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the sand of the two of them in the clouds. For a moment he thought she was trying to get him excited, then he realized that she was rebuking him. \u2018Who are we,\u2019 she was saying, \u2018to say he\u2019s mad?\u2019 His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like. What it was like was this: It was inside out. Actually inside out, to the extent that they had to park on the carpet. All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was decorated in a tasteful interior designed pink, were bookshelves, also a couple of those odd three legged tables with semi circular tops which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped the wall straight through them, and pictures which were clearly designed to soothe. Where it got really odd was the roof. It folded back on itself like something that Maurits C. Escher, had he been given to hard nights on the town, which it is no part of this narrative\u2019s purpose to suggest was the case, though it is sometimes hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one with all the awkward steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up after having been on one, for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up. Confusing. The sign above the front door said, \u2018Come Outside\u2019, and so, nervously, they had. Inside, of course, was where the Outside was. Rough brickwork, nicely done pointing, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a couple of small trees, some rooms leading off. And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had Maurits C. Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to enclose the Pacific Ocean itself. \u2018Hello,\u2019 said John Watson, Wonko the Sane. Good, they thought to themselves, \u2018Hello\u2019 is something we can cope with. \u2018Hello,\u2019 they said, and all surprisingly was smiles. For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, \u2018I forget...\u2019 whenever they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly round the eccentricities of his house. \u2018It gives me pleasure,\u2019 he said, \u2018in a curious kind of way, and does nobody any harm,\u2019 he continued, \u2018that a competent optician couldn\u2019t correct.\u2019 They liked him. He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able to mock himself before anybody else did. \u2018Your wife,\u2019 said Arthur, looking around, \u2018mentioned some toothpicks.\u2019 He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried that she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them again. Wonko the Sane laughed. It was a light easy laugh, and sounded like one he had used a lot before and was happy with. \u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s to do with the day I finally realized that the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put it in, poor thing, and hoped it would get better.\u2019 This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous again. \u2018Here,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018we are outside the Asylum.\u2019 He pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the guttering. \u2018Go through that door,\u2019 he pointed at the first door through which they had originally entered, \u2018and you go into the Asylum. I\u2019ve tried to decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy, but there\u2019s very little one can do. I never go in there now myself. If ever I am tempted, which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the door and I shy away.\u2019 \u2018That one?\u2019 said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue plaque with some instructions written on it. \u2018Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what I had to do.\u2019 The sign said: Hold stick near centre of its length. Moisten pointed end in mouth. Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in\u2013out motion. \u2018It seemed to me,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks was no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane.\u2019 He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers. \u2018And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it possibly might, I am completely sane. Which is why I call myself Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point. Wonko is what my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over, and sane is what I am, and how,\u2019 he added, with one of his smiles that made you feel, \u2018Oh. Well, that\u2019s all right, then.\u2019, \u2018I intend to remain. Shall we go onto the beach and see what we have to talk about?\u2019 They went out onto the beach, which was where he started talking about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl sandals. \u2018About the dolphins...\u2019 said Fenchurch gently, hopefully. \u2018I can show you the sandals,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane. \u2018I wonder, do you know...\u2019 \u2018Would you like me to show you,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018the sandals? I have them. I\u2019ll get them. They are made by the Dr Scholl company, and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in. They say they run a concession stand by the message. When I say I don\u2019t know what that means they say, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d and laugh. Well, I\u2019ll get them anyway.\u2019 As he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand. \u2018How are the feet today?\u2019 said Arthur quietly. \u2018OK. It doesn\u2019t feel so odd in the sand. Or in the water. The water touches them perfectly. I just think this isn\u2019t our world.\u2019 She shrugged. \u2018What do you think he meant,\u2019 she said, \u2018by the message?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Arthur, though the memory of a man called Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him. When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned Arthur. Not the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden bottomed sandals. \u2018I just thought you\u2019d like to see,\u2019 he said, \u2018what angels wear on their feet. Just out of curiosity. I\u2019m not trying to prove anything, by the way. I\u2019m a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child. If he sees a thing, he must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not. See first, think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. Most scientists forget that. I\u2019ll show you something to demonstrate that later. So, the other reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think I am a fool. That allows me to say what I see when I see it. You can\u2019t possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that you\u2019re a fool. Anyway, I also thought you might like to see this.\u2019 This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him carrying, for it was a wonderful silver grey glass fish bowl, seemingly identical to the one in Arthur\u2019s bedroom. Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without success, to say, \u2018Where did you get that?\u2019 sharply, and with a gasp in his voice. Finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond. \u2018Where did you get that?\u2019 said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp in her voice. Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said, \u2018What? Have you seen one of these before?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019ve got one. Or at least did have. Russell nicked it to put his golfballs in. I don\u2019t know where it came from, just that I was angry with Russell for nicking it. Why, have you got one?\u2019 \u2018Yes, it was...\u2019 They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing sharply backwards and forwards between them, and trying to get a gasp in edgeways. \u2018You have one of these too?\u2019 he said to both of them. \u2018Yes.\u2019 They both said it. He looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the bowl to catch the light of the Californian sun. The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them. He turned it, and turned it. They could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words \u2018So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish.\u2019 \u2018Do you know,\u2019 asked Wonko quietly, \u2018what it is?\u2019 They each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass. \u2018It is a farewell gift from the dolphins,\u2019 said Wonko in a low quiet voice, \u2018the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam with, and fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language, a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult, considering the fact that I now realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to.\u2019 He shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur. \u2018Have you...\u2019 he said to Arthur, \u2018what have you done with yours? May I ask you that?\u2019 \u2018Er, I keep a fish in it,\u2019 said Arthur, slightly embarrassed. \u2018I happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and er, there was this bowl.\u2019 He tailed off. \u2018You\u2019ve done nothing else? No,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you had, you would know.\u2019 He shook his head again. \u2018My wife kept wheatgerm in ours,\u2019 resumed Wonko, with some new tone in his voice, \u2018until last night...\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Arthur slowly and hushedly, \u2018happened last night?\u2019 \u2018We ran out of wheatgerm,\u2019 said Wonko, evenly. \u2018My wife,\u2019 he added, \u2018has gone to get some more.\u2019 He seemed lost with his own thoughts for a moment. \u2018And what happened then?\u2019 said Fenchurch, in the same breathless tone. \u2018I washed it,\u2019 said Wonko. \u2018I washed it very carefully, very very carefully, removing every last speck of wheat germ, then I dried it slowly with a lint free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it over and over. Then I held it to my ear. Have you... have you held one to your ear?\u2019 They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly. \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 he said, \u2018you should.\u2019 32 The deep roar of the ocean. The break of waves on shores further than thought can find. The silent thunders of the deep. And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming trillings, wordlings, the half articulated songs of thought. Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the inarticulate, words breaking together. A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth. Waves of joy on \u2013 where? A world indescribably found, indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water. A fugue of voices now, clamouring for explanations, of a disaster unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words. And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the flight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone. Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear. \u2018This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the Humans. We bid you farewell.\u2019 And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling. 33 That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from inside it. \u2018This is what I wanted you to see,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane when the news came around again, \u2018an old colleague of mine. He\u2019s over in your country running an investigation. Just watch.\u2019 It was a press conference. \u2018I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t comment on the name Rain God at this present time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para Causal Meteorological Phenomenon.\u2019 \u2018Can you tell us what that means?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not altogether sure. Let\u2019s be straight here. If we find something we can\u2019t understand, we like to call it something you can\u2019t understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go around calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something we don\u2019t, and I\u2019m afraid we couldn\u2019t have that. \u2018No, first we have to call it something which says it\u2019s ours, not yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it\u2019s not what you said it is, but something we say it is. \u2018And if it turns out that you\u2019re right, you\u2019ll still be wrong, because we will simply call him a... er, \u201cSuper normal...\u201d \u2013 not paranormal or supernatural because you think you know what those mean now, no, a \u201cSupernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer\u201d. We\u2019ll probably want to shove a \u201cQuasi\u201d in there somewhere to protect ourselves. Rain God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life. Admittedly, you wouldn\u2019t catch me going on holiday with him. Thanks, that\u2019ll be all for now, other than to say \u201cHi!\u201d to Wonko if he\u2019s watching.\u2019 34 On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the plane who was looking at them rather oddly. They talked quietly to themselves. \u2018I still have to know,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018and I strongly feel that you know something that you\u2019re not telling me.\u2019 Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper. \u2018Do you have a pencil?\u2019 he said. She dug around and found one. \u2018What are you doing, sweetheart?\u2019 she said, after he had spent twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil again and grunting irritably to himself. \u2018Trying to remember an address someone once gave me.\u2019 \u2018Your life would be an awful lot simpler,\u2019 she said, \u2018if you bought yourself an address book.\u2019 Finally he passed the paper to her. \u2018You look after it,\u2019 he said. She looked at it. Among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words \u2018Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. Sevorbeupstry. Planet of Preliumtarn. Sun Zarss. Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma.\u2019 \u2018And what\u2019s there?\u2019 \u2018Apparently,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation.\u2019 \u2018That sounds a bit more like it,\u2019 said Fenchurch. \u2018How do we get there?\u2019 \u2018You really...?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Fenchurch firmly, \u2018I really want to know.\u2019 Arthur looked out of the scratchy little Perspex window at the open sky outside. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 said the woman, who had been looking at them rather oddly, suddenly, \u2018I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m rude. I get so bored on these long flights, it\u2019s nice to talk to somebody. My name\u2019s Enid Kapelsen, I\u2019m from Boston. Tell me, do you fly a lot?\u2019 35 They went to Arthur\u2019s house in the West Country, shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every Galactic hitchhiker ends up spending most of his time doing. They waited for a flying saucer to come by. \u2018Friend of mine did this for fifteen years,\u2019 said Arthur one night as they sat forlornly watching the sky. \u2018Who was that?\u2019 \u2018Called Ford Prefect.\u2019 He caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again. He wondered where Ford Prefect was. By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incident with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in pubs. Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and complaining that Arthur never answered the phone. In fact, he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he\u2019d been pulled through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester. He staggered into Arthur\u2019s sitting room, waving aside all offers of support, which was an error, because the effort of waving caused him to lose his balance altogether and Arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018thank you very much. Have you...\u2019 he said, and fell asleep for three hours. \u2018... the faintest idea,\u2019 he continued suddenly, when he revived, \u2018how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Pleiades? I can see that you haven\u2019t, so I\u2019ll tell you,\u2019 he said, \u2018over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to make me.\u2019 He followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen. \u2018Stupid operators keep asking you where you\u2019re calling from and you try and tell them Letchworth and they say you couldn\u2019t be if you\u2019re coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Making you some black coffee.\u2019 \u2018Oh.\u2019 Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place forlornly. \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 he said. \u2018Rice Krispies.\u2019 \u2018And this?\u2019 \u2018Paprika.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down, one on top of the other, but that didn\u2019t seem to balance properly, so he put the other on top of the one and that seemed to work. \u2018A little space lagged,\u2019 he said. \u2018What was I saying?\u2019 \u2018About not phoning from Letchworth.\u2019 \u2018I wasn\u2019t. I explained this to the lady. \u201cBugger Letch worth,\u201d I said, \u201cif that\u2019s your attitude. I am in fact calling from a sales scoutship of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the sub light speed leg of a journey between the stars known to your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady\u201d \u2013 I said \u201cdear lady\u201d,\u2019 explained Ford Prefect, \u2018because I didn\u2019t want her to be offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin...\u2019 \u2018Tactful,\u2019 said Arthur Dent. \u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018tactful.\u2019 He frowned. \u2018Space lag,\u2019 he said, \u2018is very bad for sub clauses. You\u2019ll have to assist me again,\u2019 he continued, \u2018by reminding me what I was talking about.\u2019 \u2018 \u201cBetween the stars,\u201d \u2019 said Arthur, \u2018 \u201cknown to your world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady, as...\u201d \u2019 \u2018 \u201cPleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta,\u201d \u2019 concluded Ford triumphantly. \u2018This conversation lark is quite a gas, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Have some coffee.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, no. \u201cAnd the reason,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy I am bothering you with it rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny pinching son of a star beast piloting this son of a starbeast starship insists that I call collect. Can you believe that?\u201d \u2019 \u2018And could she?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. She had hung up,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018by this time. So! What do you suppose,\u2019 he asked fiercely, \u2018I did next?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve no idea, Ford,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Pity,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I was hoping you could remind me. I really hate those guys, you know. They really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly or, when they do, perform functions that no sane man would require of them and,\u2019 he added savagely, \u2018go beep to tell you when they\u2019ve done it!\u2019 This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by right thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being right thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that \u2018it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all. \u2018In other words \u2013 and this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation\u2019s Galaxy wide success is founded \u2013 their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.\u2019 \u2018And this guy,\u2019 ranted Ford, \u2018was on a drive to sell more of them! His five year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their restaurants, elevators and wine bars! Or if they didn\u2019t have restaurants, elevators and wine bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have! Where\u2019s that coffee!\u2019 \u2018I threw it away.\u2019 \u2018Make some more. I have now remembered what I did next. I saved civilization as we know it. I knew it was something like that.\u2019 He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and making beep beep noises. A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur followed him. Ford looked stunned. \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 he demanded. \u2018Making some coffee,\u2019 said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face. He had long ago realized that the only way of being in Ford\u2019s company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear them at all times. \u2018You missed the best bit!\u2019 raged Ford. \u2018You missed the bit where I jumped the guy! Now,\u2019 he said, \u2018I shall have to jump him, all over him!\u2019 He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it. \u2018It was better,\u2019 he said sullenly, \u2018last time,\u2019 and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining table. \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up wreckage, \u2018and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 screamed Ford. \u2018What? You missed that bit too? That\u2019s the suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended animation facility. Well, I had to, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 \u2018So it would seem,\u2019 said Arthur, in his placid voice. \u2018Don\u2019t touch that!!!\u2019 yelled Ford. Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly. \u2018OK,\u2019 said Ford, calming down, \u2018listen to it.\u2019 Arthur put the phone to his ear. \u2018It\u2019s the speaking clock,\u2019 he said. \u2018Beep, beep, beep,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018is exactly what is being heard all over that guy\u2019s ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a little known moon of Sesefras Magna. The London Speaking Clock!\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to ask the big one. \u2018Why?\u2019 he said, placidly. \u2018With a bit of luck,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the phone bill will bankrupt the buggers.\u2019 He threw himself, sweating, on to the sofa. \u2018Anyway,\u2019 he said, \u2018dramatic arrival, don\u2019t you think?\u2019 36 The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had stunned the world. Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs. This time it was real, it was definite. It was quite definitely definite. It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world, including much of Harrods. The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in colour, pitted, scorched and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man. A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Harrods Food Halls, demolished Harvey Nichols, and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture toppled the Sheraton Park Tower. After a long, heart stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall. It held up a hand. \u2018I come in peace,\u2019 it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, \u2018take me to your Lizard.\u2019 Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with Arthur and watched the nonstop frenetic news reports on the television, none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting short incomprehensible error messages. \u2018It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...\u2019 \u2018You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, \u2018nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.\u2019 \u2018Odd,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I thought you said it was a democracy.\u2019 \u2018I did,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It is.\u2019 \u2018So,\u2019 said Arthur, hoping he wasn\u2019t sounding ridiculously obtuse, \u2018why don\u2019t people get rid of the lizards?\u2019 \u2018It honestly doesn\u2019t occur to them,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018They\u2019ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they\u2019ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.\u2019 \u2018You mean they actually vote for the lizards?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Ford with a shrug, \u2018of course.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said Arthur, going for the big one again, \u2018why?\u2019 \u2018Because if they didn\u2019t vote for a lizard,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I said,\u2019 said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, \u2018have you got any gin?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll look. Tell me about the lizards.\u2019 Ford shrugged again. \u2018Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone\u2019s got to say it.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s terrible,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Listen, bud,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say \u201cThat\u2019s terrible\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin. But I haven\u2019t and I am. Anyway, what are you looking so placid and moon eyed for? Are you in love?\u2019 Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly. \u2018With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to meet her?\u2019 He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers she\u2019d been into the village to buy. She stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from Betelgeuse on the sofa. \u2018Where\u2019s the gin?\u2019 said Ford to Fenchurch. And to Arthur, \u2018What happened to Trillian, by the way?\u2019 \u2018Er, this is Fenchurch,\u2019 said Arthur, awkwardly. \u2018There was nothing with Trillian, you must have seen her last.\u2019 \u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018she went off with Zaphod somewhere. They had some kids or something. At least,\u2019 he added, \u2018I think that\u2019s what they were. Zaphod\u2019s calmed down a lot, you know.\u2019 \u2018Really?\u2019 said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid.\u2019 \u2018Arthur, who is this?\u2019 said Fenchurch. \u2018Ford Prefect,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I may have mentioned him in passing.\u2019 37 For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things. Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it \u2013 but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon slowly. At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing. It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion. It would have to send out its service robots. It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number of problems. The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the surrounding terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others. One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived. A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the Zoo in Regent\u2019s Park, and most particularly the Reptile House. Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the petshop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high level talks with them. Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, frank and wide ranging exchange of views the high level talks had broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot, would take a short holiday somewhere, and for some reason selected Bournemouth. Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another beer. Immediate preparations were made for its departure. The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout that day and all through the night time, and in the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry. Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival, buzzed around by its servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed itself of its transport system\u2019s embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach. It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to Bournemouth. Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out and guarded as the robot\u2019s recreation area, and tried to see what it was doing. It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a little awkwardly on its face. It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed, which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service robots guarding the perimeter. It was an extraordinary breakthrough. \u2018I think there\u2019s a story in it,\u2019 confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel link fence, \u2018but it needs a good local angle. I\u2019ve got a little list of questions here,\u2019 he went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket, \u2018perhaps you could get him, it, whatever you call him, to run through them quickly.\u2019 The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it could do and screeched off. A reply was never forthcoming. Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the massive battle scarred industrial quality circuits of the robot\u2019s mind. They were these: \u2018How do you feel about being a robot?\u2019 \u2018How does it feel to be from outer space?\u2019 and \u2018How do you like Bournemouth?\u2019 Early the following day things started to be packed up and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good. \u2018The point is,\u2019 said Fenchurch to Ford, \u2018can you get us on board?\u2019 Ford looked wildly at his watch. \u2018I have some serious unfinished business to attend to,\u2019 he exclaimed. 38 Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, which wasn\u2019t very. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service robots. Staked out around that was the army, who had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them. They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from the public, or to guarantee the giant ship\u2019s diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate. The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The army stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up and go. The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o\u2019clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it. Much had been heard \u2013 more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed. This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives, and now it was simply going to go without them. Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there. \u2018How reliable is he?\u2019 asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice. \u2018How reliable?\u2019 said Arthur. He gave a hollow laugh. \u2018How shallow is the ocean?\u2019 he said. \u2018How cold is the sun?\u2019 The last parts of the robot\u2019s gantry transport were being carried on board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them. The soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of course, could be done about any of it. Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them nowhere. And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship, every last link of the fence was aboard. A couple of flying fretsaws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site, and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves. A few seconds passed. The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the Harrods Food Halls. The sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored. \u2018Hold it!\u2019 A megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd. \u2018There has been,\u2019 barked the megaphone, \u2018a major scientific break in! Through. Breakthrough,\u2019 it corrected itself. The door flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat. \u2018Hold it!\u2019 he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squat black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly, the ramp paused in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals from the Thumb (which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals), slowly ground its way downwards again. Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it. \u2018Make way,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018make way, please, this is a major scientific breakthrough. You and you, get the equipment from the taxi.\u2019 Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi. \u2018All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important pieces of scientific equipment,\u2019 boomed Ford. \u2018Just everybody keep calm. It\u2019s all under control, there\u2019s nothing to see. It is merely a major scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now. Important scientific equipment. Clear the way.\u2019 Hungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up. Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi. \u2018Hang your coat over them,\u2019 he muttered to Fenchurch as he heaved them out to her. Hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat. It clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it. \u2018Clear a path, please,\u2019 shouted Ford again. \u2018Everything\u2019s under proper scientific control.\u2019 \u2018He said you\u2019d pay,\u2019 said the taxi driver to Arthur, who dug out some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police sirens. \u2018Move along there,\u2019 shouted Ford, \u2018and no one will get hurt.\u2019 The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the rubble towards the ramp. \u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 Ford continued to bellow. \u2018There\u2019s nothing to see, it\u2019s all over. None of this is actually happening.\u2019 \u2018Clear the way, please,\u2019 boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd. \u2018There\u2019s been a break in, clear the way.\u2019 \u2018Breakthrough,\u2019 yelled Ford in competition. \u2018A scientific breakthrough!\u2019 \u2018This is the police! Clear the way!\u2019 \u2018Scientific equipment! Clear the way!\u2019 \u2018Police! Let us through!\u2019 \u2018Walkmen!\u2019 yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up on to the lip of it. \u2018Hold tight,\u2019 muttered Ford, and released a button on his Electronic Thumb. Beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way upwards. \u2018OK, kids,\u2019 he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship, \u2018looks like we\u2019re on our way.\u2019 39 Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire. Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily. They were claustrophobic and ill lit. The lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly. That wasn\u2019t it, though. He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so. That wasn\u2019t it either. He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he walked towards the other. He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened but still badly scratched Perspex. \u2018Would you turn it down, please?\u2019 he said to Ford Prefect, who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment he\u2019d taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans. \u2018Shhhh!\u2019 hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven. \u2018Just a bit,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No!\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018We\u2019re just getting to the good bit! Listen, I finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion, everything, and this is the good bit!\u2019 With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit. He listened to Ford\u2019s whoops and yells and \u2018yeeehay!\u2019s as placidly as he could. \u2018Ford,\u2019 he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca, \u2018how come, if...\u2019 \u2018This is the big one,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018This is the one I came back for. Do you realize I never saw it all through? Always I missed the end. I saw half of it again the night before the Vogons came. When they blew the place up I thought I\u2019d never get to see it. Hey, what happened with all that, anyway?\u2019 \u2018Just life,\u2019 said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six pack. \u2018Oh, that again,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I thought it might be something like that. I prefer this stuff,\u2019 he said as Rick\u2019s Bar flickered on to the screen. \u2018How come if what?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018You started to say, \u201chow come if...\u201d \u2019 \u2018How come if you\u2019re so rude about the Earth, that you... oh never mind, let\u2019s just watch the movie.\u2019 \u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Ford. 40 There remains little still to tell. Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of Flanux until the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were discovered lying behind them, lie the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine. Within the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the star named Zarss, around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn on which is the land of Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of Sevorbeupstry that Arthur and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey. And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red Plain of Rars, which was bounded on the south side by the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, on the further side of which, according to the dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty foot high letters of fire God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation. According to Prak, if Arthur\u2019s memory served him right, the place was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a manner, it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them a ticket. \u2018Keep to the left, please,\u2019 he said, \u2018keep to the left,\u2019 and hurried on past them on a little scooter. They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the path that led around the left of the Great Plain was well worn and dotted with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain which was heated by the fire of the letters that formed God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation. At another they bought some postcards. The letters had been blurred with an air brush, \u2018So as not to spoil the Big Surprise!\u2019 it said on the reverse. \u2018Do you know what the message is?\u2019 they asked the wizened little lady in the booth. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 she piped cheerily, \u2018oh yes!\u2019 She waved them on. Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red Plain rippled in the heat. \u2018Is it possible,\u2019 asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, \u2018to rent one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic Ventrawhatsit had?\u2019 \u2018The scooters,\u2019 said the little lady who was serving at the ice cream bar, \u2018are not for the devout.\u2019 \u2018Oh well, that\u2019s easy, then,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018we\u2019re not particularly devout. We\u2019re just interested.\u2019 \u2018Then you must turn back now,\u2019 said the little lady severely, and when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sunhats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the Great Red Plain of Rars. They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out into the sun again. \u2018We\u2019re running out of barrier cream,\u2019 said Fenchurch after a few more miles. \u2018We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our steps.\u2019 They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat haze; they looked behind themselves. They elected to go on. They then discovered that they were not only not the first to make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making it now. Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half limping, half crawling. It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred and twisted metal. It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot dry dust. \u2018So much time,\u2019 it groaned, \u2018oh so much time. And pain as well, so much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too. One or the other on its own I could probably manage. It\u2019s the two together that really get me down. Oh hello, you again.\u2019 \u2018Marvin?\u2019 said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it. \u2018Is that you?\u2019 \u2018You were always one,\u2019 groaned the aged husk of the robot, \u2018for the super intelligent question, weren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018What is it?\u2019 whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind Arthur, and grasping on to his arm. \u2018He\u2019s sort of an old friend,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I...\u2019 \u2018Friend!\u2019 croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away in a kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of his mouth. \u2018You\u2019ll have to excuse me while I try and remember what the word means. My memory banks are not what they were, you know, and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory back up. Ah, here it comes.\u2019 The robot\u2019s battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought. \u2018Hmm,\u2019 he said, \u2018what a curious concept.\u2019 He thought a little longer. \u2018No,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018don\u2019t think I ever came across one of those. Sorry, can\u2019t help you there.\u2019 He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, and then tried to twist himself up on to his misshapen elbows. \u2018Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you, perhaps?\u2019 he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. \u2018A piece of paper that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you would like me,\u2019 he continued, \u2018to open a door?\u2019 His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to scan the distant horizon. \u2018Don\u2019t seem to be any doors around at present,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I\u2019m sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one. And then,\u2019 he said slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur again, \u2018I could open it for you. I\u2019m quite used to waiting, you know.\u2019 \u2018Arthur,\u2019 hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, \u2018you never told me of this. What have you done to this poor creature?\u2019 \u2018Nothing,\u2019 insisted Arthur sadly, \u2018he\u2019s always like this...\u2019 \u2018Ha!\u2019 snapped Marvin. \u2018Ha!\u2019 he repeated. \u2018What do you know of always? You say \u201calways\u201d to me, who, because of the silly little errands you organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now thirty seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words with a little more care,\u2019 he coughed, \u2018and tact.\u2019 He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed. \u2018Leave me,\u2019 he said, \u2018go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully on my way. My time at last is nearly come. My race is nearly run. I fully expect,\u2019 he said, feebly waving them on with a broken finger, \u2018to come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am, brain the size...\u2019 Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms. They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the Great Red Plain of Rars towards the encircling mountains of Quentulus Quazgar. Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often interrupted by Marvin\u2019s dolorous cybernetic ravings. They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths, and some soothing oil, but Marvin would have none of it. \u2018I\u2019m all spare parts,\u2019 he droned. \u2018Let me be!\u2019 he groaned. \u2018Every part of me,\u2019 he moaned, \u2018has been replaced at least fifty times... except...\u2019 He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment. His head bobbed between them with the effort of memory. \u2018Do you remember, the first time you ever met me,\u2019 he said at last to Arthur, \u2018I had been given the intellect stretching task of taking you up to the bridge? I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side? That I had asked for them to be replaced but they never were?\u2019 He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move, let alone set. \u2018See if you can guess,\u2019 said Marvin, when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough, \u2018which parts of me were never replaced? Go on, see if you can guess. \u2018Ouch,\u2019 he added, \u2018ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.\u2019 At last they reached the last of the little booths, set down Marvin between them and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought some cufflinks for Russell, cufflinks that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in which was written God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation. Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message. \u2018Ready?\u2019 he said to Fenchurch, who nodded. They heaved Marvin up between them. They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the Mountain. There was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a good view. It had a little pay telescope for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve. They gazed at God\u2019s Final Message in wonderment, and were slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and complete understanding. Fenchurch sighed. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018that was it.\u2019 They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the message. They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision circuits had almost gone. They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn. The first letter was a \u2018w\u2019, the second an \u2018e\u2019. Then there was a gap. An \u2018a\u2019 followed, then a \u2018p\u2019, an \u2018o\u2019 and an \u2018l\u2019. Marvin paused for a rest. After a few moments they resumed and let him see the \u2018o\u2019, the \u2018g\u2019, the \u2018i\u2019, the \u2018s\u2019 and the \u2018e\u2019. The next two words were \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019. The last one was a long one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it. It started with \u2018i\u2019, then \u2018n\u2019 then a \u2018c\u2019. Next came an \u2018o\u2019 and an \u2018n\u2019, followed by a \u2018v\u2019, an \u2018e\u2019, another \u2018n\u2019 and an \u2018i\u2019. After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch. He read the \u2018e\u2019, the \u2018n\u2019, the \u2018c\u2019 and at last the final \u2018e\u2019, and staggered back into their arms. \u2018I think,\u2019 he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding rattling thorax, \u2018I feel good about it.\u2019 The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever. Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings. Epilogue One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldn\u2019t keep his mind on the job in hand. Brilliant? Certainly. One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other generation, including a number he had designed himself? Without a doubt. The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldn\u2019t be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now. He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition. So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, Blart Versenwald III (his name was Blart Versenwald III, which is not strictly relevant, but quite interesting because \u2013 never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why it\u2019s interesting later), was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, \u2018Concentrate!\u2019 So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of super fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open half of a half open window, and also an off switch for children. Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be shortlived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were landing. But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races, were only on the rampage because they couldn\u2019t cope with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald\u2019s extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide ranging series of trading agreements and set up a programme of cultural exchanges. And, in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned lived happily ever after. There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler\u2019s mind. Original press release for So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish Douglas Adams\u2019 original synopsis for So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish Promotional material for So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish Would you like to continue reading about Arthur Dent and his many adventures across time and space? If so, pick up the story in the next part of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series. An extract follows here from MOSTLY HARMLESS 1 The history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a number of reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things have been happening anyway. One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can\u2019t. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws. The Hingefreel people of Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad news but they didn\u2019t work particularly well and were so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasn\u2019t really any point in being there. So, by and large, the peoples of the Galaxy tended to languish in their own local muddles and the history of the Galaxy itself was, for a long time, largely cosmological. Which is not to say that people weren\u2019t trying. They tried sending off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere. By the time they eventually arrived, other forms of travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light, so that whatever battles it was that the slower than light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by the time they actually got there. This didn\u2019t, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they\u2019d had a couple of thousand years\u2019 sleep, they\u2019d come a long way to do a tough job and by Zarquon they were going to do it. This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set in, with battles continually re erupting centuries after the issues they had been fought over had supposedly been settled. However, these muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once time travel was discovered and battles started pre erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose. When the Infinite Improbability Drive arrived and whole planets started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of the University of Maximegalon finally gave up, closed itself down and surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of Divinity and Water Polo, which had been after them for years. Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that no one will ever know for sure where, for instance, the Grebulons came from, or exactly what it was they wanted. And this is a pity, because if anybody had known anything about them, it is just possible that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted \u2013 or at least would have had to find a different way to happen. Click, hum. The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black void. It was travelling at fabulous, breathtaking speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background of a billion distant stars, to be moving not at all. It was just one dark speck frozen against an infinite granularity of brilliant night. On board the ship, everything was as it had been for millennia, deeply dark and silent. Click, hum. At least, almost everything. Click, click, hum. Click, hum, click, hum, click, hum. Click, click, click, click, click, hum. Hmmm. A low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level supervising program deep in the ship\u2019s semi somnolent cyberbrain and reported to it that whenever it went click all it got was a hum. The higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed to get, and the low level supervising program said that it couldn\u2019t remember exactly, but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh, wasn\u2019t it? It didn\u2019t know what this hum was. Click, hum, click, hum. That was all it was getting. The higher level supervising program considered this and didn\u2019t like it. It asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was supervising and the low level supervising program said it couldn\u2019t remember that either, just that it was something that was meant to go click, sigh every ten years or so, which usually happened without fail. It had tried to consult its error look up table but couldn\u2019t find it, which was why it had alerted the higher level supervising program to the problem. The higher level supervising program went to consult one of its own look up tables to find out what the low level supervising program was meant to be supervising. It couldn\u2019t find the look up table. Odd. It looked again. All it got was an error message. It tried to look up the error message in its error message look up table and couldn\u2019t find that either. It allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went through all this again. Then it woke up its sector function supervisor. The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems. It called its supervising agent which hit problems too. Within a few millionths of a second virtual circuits that had lain dormant, some for years, some for centuries, were flaring into life throughout the ship. Something, somewhere, had gone terribly wrong, but none of the supervising programs could tell what it was. At every level, vital instructions were missing, and the instructions about what to do in the event of discovering that vital instructions were missing, were also missing. Small modules of software \u2013 agents \u2013 surged through the logical pathways, grouping, consulting, re grouping. They quickly established that the ship\u2019s memory, all the way back to its central mission module, was in tatters. No amount of interrogation could determine what it was that had happened. Even the central mission module itself seemed to be damaged. This made the whole problem very simple to deal with. Replace the central mission module. There was another one, a backup, an exact duplicate of the original. It had to be physically replaced because, for safety reasons, there was no link whatsoever between the original and its backup. Once the central mission module was replaced it could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail, and all would be well. Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the shielded strong room, where they guarded it, to the ship\u2019s logic chamber for installation. This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity of the instructions. At last the robots were satisfied that all procedures were correct. They unpacked the backup central mission module from its storage housing, carried it out of the storage chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void. This provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong. Further investigation quickly established what it was that had happened. A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship. The ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly knocked out that part of the ship\u2019s processing equipment which was supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a meteorite. The first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole. This turned out to be impossible, because the ship\u2019s sensors couldn\u2019t see that there was a hole, and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors weren\u2019t working properly weren\u2019t working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine. The ship could only deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it, taking its spare brain, which would have enabled it to see the hole, with them. The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then blanked out completely for a bit. It didn\u2019t realize it had blanked out, of course, because it had blanked out. It was merely surprised to see the stars jump. After the third time the stars jumped the ship finally realized that it must be blanking out, and that it was time to take some serious decisions. It relaxed. Then it realized it hadn\u2019t actually taken the serious decisions yet and panicked. It blanked out again for a bit. When it awoke again it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must be. It clearly hadn\u2019t got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully, but since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or how to reach it, there seemed to be little point in continuing. It consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could reconstruct from the tatters of its central mission module. \u2018Your !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! year mission is to !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!, !!!!!, !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!, land !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! a safe distance !!!!! !!!!! monitor it. !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!...\u2019 All of the rest was complete garbage. Before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on those instructions, such as they were, to its more primitive subsidiary systems. It must also revive all of its crew. There was another problem. While the crew was in hibernation, the minds of all of its members, their memories, their identities and their understanding of what they had come to do, had all been transferred into the ship\u2019s central mission module for safe keeping. The crew would not have the faintest idea of who they were or what they were doing there. Oh well. Just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realized that its engines were beginning to give out too. The ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under the control of its subsidiary automatic systems, which simply looked to land wherever they could find to land and monitor whatever they could find to monitor. As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didn\u2019t do very well. The planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so achingly far from the sun that should warm it, that it took all of the Envir O Form machinery and LifeSupport O Systems they carried with them to render it, or at least enough parts of it, habitable. There were better planets nearer in, but the ship\u2019s Strateej O Mat was obviously locked into Lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive planet and, furthermore, would not be gainsaid by anybody other than the ship\u2019s Chief Strategic Officer. Since everybody on the ship had lost their minds no one knew who the Chief Strategic Officer was or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go about gainsaying the ship\u2019s Strateej O Mat. As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though, they hit solid gold. ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, founded in 1980, is the official Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy appreciation society.

        "I give stuff away here.",
        "There are spoilers ahead.",
        "Just read the book.",
        "I\u2019ll be here when you get back.",
        "No, I mean it.",
        "I\u2019ll put down some asterisks.",
        "I\u2019ll see you after them, when you\u2019ve read the book.",
        "* * * Douglas Adams was tall.",
        "He was brilliant: I\u2019ve met a handful of geniuses, and I\u2019d count him as one of them.",
        "He was a frustrated performer, a remarkable explainer and communicator, an enthusiast.",
        "He was an astonishing comic writer: he could craft sentences that changed the way a reader viewed the world, and sum up complex and difficult issues in aptly chosen metaphors.",
        "He combined the trappings of science fiction with profound social commentary and a healthy sense of humour to create fresh worlds.",
        "He loved computers and was an astonishingly fine public speaker.",
        "He was a bestselling author.",
        "He was a competent guitarist, a world traveller, an environ mentalist, a man who held remarkably wonderful parties, a gourmand.",
        "What he was not, and this may seem somewhat odd, especially when you consider how many of them he wrote and sold, and how famously well he wrote them, was a novelist.",
        "And this, I suspect unarguably, is the oddest of his novels.",
        "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish was Douglas\u2019s first attempt to write a novel from scratch.",
        "In many ways it could be seen as an experiment.",
        "A transitional novel between the galaxy spanning romps of the first three Hitchhiker books and the more Earth bound adventures of Dirk Gently.",
        "It was, after all, the first of the three of Douglas\u2019s books not to have originated in the extraordinary period of creativity that took him from the creation of the Hitchhiker\u2019s radio series to the end of his time as script editor of Doctor Who.",
        "His first two books, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, had strong foundations: they were built on the backs of the scripts that Douglas, and (for the second series) Douglas and John Lloyd, had crafted for the original Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy BBC Radio 4 series.",
        "The third book, Life, the Universe and Everything, was adapted from an unused outline Douglas had written for a Doctor Who film, Doctor Who and the Krikketmen.",
        "His next book, the remarkable Dirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency, was adapted from Douglas\u2019s unfilmed Doctor Who story Shada (with a sprinkling of ideas from the filmed Doctor Who story City of Death).",
        "The first books had been written by Douglas as a young man for a world that expected nothing, as paperback originals.",
        "Now Douglas was, for the first time, being published in hardback.",
        "He was a bestselling novelist, who had not yet written a book he was proud of.",
        "This may partly have been because he was not a novelist.",
        "Now he needed to write a book he had been paid a lot of money to write.",
        "His accountant had embezzled most of the money and then killed himself.",
        "Douglas Adams had gone to Hollywood on his first, abortive, quest to get The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy made into a film.",
        "He had lived there for over a year, doing drafts of the film, did not have a good time and, surprised and a little battered, he had returned home to a small converted stable house off Upper Street in Islington where, eventually, and under pressure, he put off actually writing So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.",
        "His publishers, Pan, found themselves, early in 1984, soliciting a book that was, for the most part, unwritten and, for that matter, mostly unplotted.",
        "The lenticular image on the original cover showed a walrus that became a dinosaur, because Douglas had mentioned that there would be a walrus in the book.",
        "There would be no walrus in the book.",
        "It became part of the story of the book that, as the publishing date of the book got closer and the book got no closer to being written, publisher Sonny Mehta had taken a hotel suite and essentially locked Douglas in to write it, editing the pages as they came through.",
        "It was a strange way for a book to be written, and something Douglas used as an excuse for any problems that the book had.",
        "But it was a book he was still particularly proud of when it came out.",
        "I remember that.",
        "Douglas Adams had returned from America to Islington, and So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish occurs in the space that Southern California isn\u2019t.",
        "Which is to say that both Douglas\u2019s Outer Space and his Southern California are extremely Californian: the hotel in which rock stars read Language, Truth and Logic by the pool and the bar in which Ford Prefect attempts to pay his bill with an American Express card are not a galaxy apart, and the hooker who has a special service for rich people could exist as easily in one world as another.",
        "Arthur Dent, in previous stories a flat character who existed mostly to boggle at the improbabilities, often infinite, he was confronted with, became someone significantly more like Douglas.",
        "Douglas\u2019s return from America was echoed in Arthur Dent\u2019s return from hitchhiking across all of time and space to an Earth that the readers believed to have been destroyed, and his explanation to the world that he had been in America.",
        "It might be seen as a problem for a writer who was considered a social satirist to have, a few pages into the first book in a bestselling series, destroyed the Earth.",
        "On the good side it sets you free to explore the vastness of the infinite.",
        "On the downside, it rather limits you as an observational humourist, when it comes to specifics, and while Douglas may not have been a novelist, he was definitely an observational humourist.",
        "Still, I think there\u2019s another reason for the restoration of the Earth at the beginning of this book.",
        "Like it or not, and when it came out some people did and some people didn\u2019t, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish is a love story, and the novel puts an Earth back for there to be a love story on.",
        "Underneath all the glitter, Arthur and Fenchurch and the unlikely circumstances of their meeting, their love and the travails thereof are the true subjects of the book.",
        "And as we grow older our reading of books changes.",
        "As a young man, writing a book about Douglas Adams and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, I remember picking up on the awkwardness of Chapter 25, and Douglas\u2019s rhetorical question as to whether or not Arthur Dent has...",
        "spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?\u2019 Those who wish to know should read on.",
        "Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.",
        "I took it, at the time, as a manifestation of Douglas\u2019s contempt and discomfort with his audience, and was uncomfortable with it.",
        "Rereading it a quarter of a century later, I found myself reading those paragraphs as worried bluster, as if Douglas was scared that he was out of his depth, and was trying to respond to critics or to friends ahead of time.",
        "I still suspect that, had there been time to rewrite, to rethink, to revise, that strange breaking of the fourth wall and the author\u2013reader compact, might never have happened.",
        "I do not think it would have been a better book for not having been finished in a hotel bedroom while Sonny Mehta watched videos in the room next door.",
        "After all, it is part of its charm that So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish reads as if it has not so much been plotted as stumbled upon or backed into.",
        "It is surrealist in the way that a book extracted from the author without pause for inspection, for second thoughts or thousandth thoughts can only be.",
        "Characters appear and fade, dreamlike.",
        "Reality is frangible.",
        "The novel circles one event: a couple making love naked in the clouds, in perfect flying magical dream sex, an event that is practically a poem.",
        "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish has, beneath the elegant veneer, the simplest, easiest, most traditional of plots: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl, makes love to her in the clouds and sets off with her to find God\u2019s Final Message To His Creation.",
        "And does.",
        "After all, for a book suffused from start to finish with gloom and melancholia, a book in which the universe itself is fundamentally perverse, when it is not actually malicious, So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish is often peculiarly upbeat: Chapter 18 for example, gives us, triumphantly, something unseen in the Hitchhiker universe until now: transient and barely recognizable, but it\u2019s there: joy.",
        "He hadn\u2019t realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before, which was \u2018Yes\u2019.",
        "NEIL GAIMAN Author of Don\u2019t Panic: Douglas Adams and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and subsequently a famous author Prologue Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.",
        "Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.",
        "This planet has \u2013 or had \u2013 a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.",
        "Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper which were unhappy.",
        "And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were unhappy, even the ones with digital watches.",
        "Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.",
        "And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.",
        "And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\u00e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.",
        "This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.",
        "Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever.",
        "This is her story.",
        "1 That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year.",
        "It was cold and windy, which was normal.",
        "It started to rain, which was particularly normal.",
        "A spacecraft landed, which was not.",
        "There was nobody around to see it except for some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what.",
        "So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked.",
        "It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single beam of light.",
        "From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful \u2013 a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small.",
        "Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest Mid Galactic Census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right.",
        "You\u2019d probably guessed that anyway.",
        "The Census report, like most such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn\u2019t tell anybody anything they didn\u2019t already know \u2013 except that every single person in the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena.",
        "Since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped.",
        "The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows.",
        "It hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb.",
        "At last it dropped and was quiet.",
        "A hatchway opened.",
        "A short flight of steps unfolded itself.",
        "A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within.",
        "A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm.",
        "It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back to the ship.",
        "Already the rain was streaming through its hair.",
        "\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he called out, \u2018thank you very\u2014\u2019 He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder.",
        "He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom.",
        "It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI.",
        "BE LIKE THE TWENTY SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE \u2013 BARK! \u2018Hold on!\u2019 the figure called, waving at the ship.",
        "The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re unfolded, and allowed him back in.",
        "He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag.",
        "He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had already begun its ascent.",
        "Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth.",
        "He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky.",
        "His feet sloshed through the mud.",
        "Thunder grumbled over the hills.",
        "He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on.",
        "More lights.",
        "Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded.",
        "The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his pace, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared.",
        "And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle.",
        "The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself.",
        "Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights streaming through the wall of water.",
        "The figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him.",
        "It was a low bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing \u2013 sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed.",
        "The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night.",
        "It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared.",
        "To the figure\u2019s apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, \u2018My other car is also a Porsche.\u2019 2 Rob McKenna was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he\u2019d had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everybody.",
        "He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear.",
        "The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls.",
        "It wasn\u2019t that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped not.",
        "It was just the rain which got him down, always the rain.",
        "It was raining now, just for a change.",
        "It was a particular type of rain that he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving.",
        "He had a number for it.",
        "It was rain type 17.",
        "He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous.",
        "So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour\u2019s boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them the huskies have pissed on.",
        "Rob McKenna had two hundred and thirty one different types of rain entered in his little book, and he didn\u2019t like any of them.",
        "He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up.",
        "It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying.",
        "Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab drumming), 11 (breezy droplets) and now his least favourite of all, 17.",
        "Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didn\u2019t make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off.",
        "He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse.",
        "It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on.",
        "In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off.",
        "Swish swish swish flop swish swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flap scrape.",
        "He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore.",
        "It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside.",
        "A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing machine, and hitching.",
        "\u2018Poor miserable sod,\u2019 thought Rob McKenna to himself, realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, \u2018must be chilled to the bone.",
        "Stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this.",
        "All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you.\u2019 He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on.",
        "\u2018See what I mean?\u2019 he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it.",
        "\u2018You get some right bastards on the road.\u2019 Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitchhiker, drenched by the roadside.",
        "For a moment he felt good about this.",
        "A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it.",
        "Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night.",
        "At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles.",
        "And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, for, though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a Rain God.",
        "All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays.",
        "All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him.",
        "3 The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did exactly the same thing.",
        "The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind.",
        "After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief appearance from behind the clouds.",
        "A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex signals to the trudging figure to indicate that normally he would have been delighted to give the figure a lift, only he couldn\u2019t this time because he wasn\u2019t going in the direction that the figure wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure the figure would understand.",
        "He concluded the signalling with a cheery thumbs up sign, as if to say that he hoped the figure felt really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet, and he would catch him next time around.",
        "The figure trudged on.",
        "A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as the Renault.",
        "A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its lights at the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was meant to convey a \u2018Hello\u2019 or a \u2018Sorry we\u2019re going the other way\u2019 or a \u2018Hey look, there\u2019s someone in the rain, what a jerk\u2019 was entirely unclear.",
        "A green strip across the top of the windscreen indicated that whatever the message was, it came from Steve and Carola.",
        "The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying \u2018And another thing...\u2019 twenty minutes after admitting he\u2019s lost the argument.",
        "The air was clearer now, the night cold.",
        "Sound travelled rather well.",
        "The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a junction, where a side road turned off to the left.",
        "Opposite the turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and studied with feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as another car passed suddenly.",
        "And another.",
        "The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed meaninglessly.",
        "A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes.",
        "Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest and hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the Cortina spun its wheels in the wet and careered off up the road rather amusingly.",
        "The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected.",
        "As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went into hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather amusing mix up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before the appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis and justice, in its way, was served.",
        "The figure trudged on.",
        "A Saab drew to a halt beside him.",
        "Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, \u2018Have you come far?\u2019 The figure turned towards it.",
        "He stopped and grasped the handle of the door.",
        "* * * The figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet called the Earth, a world whose entire entry in The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy comprised the two words \u2018Mostly harmless\u2019.",
        "The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a far from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble.",
        "4 Whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane would not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed there were no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the lower south side of Han Dold City because it wasn\u2019t the sort of place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to stay alive.",
        "Any observers in the place would have been mean hawklike observers, heavily armed, with painful throbbings in their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they observed things they didn\u2019t like.",
        "One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of missile crisis sort of hush.",
        "Even the evil looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract killers, which was a service it provided for free.",
        "All eyes were on Ford Prefect.",
        "Some of them were on stalks.",
        "The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size of a small defence budget with an American Express card, which was not acceptable anywhere in the known Universe.",
        "\u2018What are you worried about?\u2019 he asked in a cheery kind of voice.",
        "\u2018The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of Neo Relativity out here? There\u2019s whole new areas of physics which can take care of this sort of thing.",
        "Time dilation effects, temporal relastatics...\u2019 \u2018We are not worried about the expiration date,\u2019 said the man to whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a dangerous city.",
        "His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft purr made by the opening of an ICBM silo.",
        "A hand like a side of meat tapped on the bar top, lightly denting it.",
        "\u2018Well, that\u2019s good then,\u2019 said Ford, packing his satchel and preparing to leave.",
        "The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder of Ford Prefect.",
        "It prevented him from leaving.",
        "Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn\u2019t attached to anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its home.",
        "It had previously been more conventionally attached to the original owner of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly bequeathed it to medical science.",
        "Medical science had decided they didn\u2019t like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back to the Old Pink Dog Bar.",
        "The new barman didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural or poltergeists or anything kooky like that, he just knew a useful ally when he saw one.",
        "The hand sat on the bar.",
        "It took orders, it served drinks, it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they wanted to be murdered.",
        "Ford Prefect sat still.",
        "\u2018We are not worried about the expiration date,\u2019 repeated the barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect\u2019s full attention.",
        "\u2018We are worried about the entire piece of plastic.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He seemed a little taken aback.",
        "\u2018This,\u2019 said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to the Land Where Fish are Eternally Blessed, \u2018we don\u2019t accept.\u2019 Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn\u2019t have any other means of payment on him, but decided for the moment to soldier on.",
        "The disembodied hand was now grasping his shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb.",
        "\u2018But you don\u2019t understand,\u2019 said Ford, his expression slowly ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity.",
        "\u2018This is the American Express card.",
        "It is the finest way of settling bills known to man.",
        "Haven\u2019t you read their junk mail?\u2019 The cheery quality of Ford\u2019s voice was beginning to grate on the barman\u2019s ears.",
        "It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a War Requiem.",
        "One of the bones in Ford\u2019s shoulder began to grate against another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested that the hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly skilled chiropractor.",
        "He hoped he could get this business settled before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder against any of the bones in different parts of his body.",
        "Luckily, the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel slung over.",
        "The barman slid the card back across the bar to Ford.",
        "\u2018We have never,\u2019 he said with muted savagery, \u2018heard of this thing.\u2019 This was hardly surprising.",
        "Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error towards the end of the fifteen years\u2019 sojourn he had spent on the planet Earth.",
        "Exactly how serious, the American Express company had got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and panic stricken demands of its debt collection department were only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.",
        "He had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a form of currency that no one would accept.",
        "\u2018Credit?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Aaaargggh...\u2019 These two words were usually coupled together in the Old Pink Dog Bar.",
        "\u2018I thought,\u2019 gasped Ford, \u2018that this was meant to be a class establishment...\u2019 He glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar\u2019s inner recesses were pitted.",
        "They were all very deliberately looking in any direction but his now, carefully picking up the threads of their former conversations about murders, drug rings and music publishing deals.",
        "They knew what would happen and didn\u2019t want to watch in case it put them off their drinks.",
        "\u2018You gonna die, boy,\u2019 the barman murmured quietly at Ford Prefect, and the evidence was on his side.",
        "The bar used to have one of those signs hanging up which said, \u2018Please don\u2019t ask for credit as a punch in the mouth often offends\u2019, but in the interest of strict accuracy this was altered to, \u2018Please don\u2019t ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar often offends\u2019.",
        "However, this made an unreadable mess of the notice, and anyway didn\u2019t have the same ring to it, so it was taken down again.",
        "It was felt that the story would get about of its own accord, and it had.",
        "\u2018Lemme look at the bill again,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He picked it up and studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman, and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons.",
        "It was a rather lengthy piece of paper.",
        "At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which always takes so long to copy on to the registration form.",
        "He had, after all, been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of rounds for all the pimps, thugs and record executives who suddenly couldn\u2019t remember who he was.",
        "He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets.",
        "There was, as he knew, nothing in them.",
        "He rested his left hand lightly but firmly on the half opened flap of his satchel.",
        "The disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder.",
        "\u2018You see,\u2019 said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly in front of Ford\u2019s, \u2018I have a reputation to think of.",
        "You see that, don\u2019t you?\u2019 This is it, thought Ford.",
        "There was nothing else for it.",
        "He had obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his bill, it had been rejected.",
        "He was now in danger of his life.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018if it\u2019s your reputation...\u2019 With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped down on the bar top his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field researcher for the Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he was now doing.",
        "\u2018Want a write up?\u2019 The barman\u2019s face stopped in mid wobble.",
        "The bird\u2019s talons stopped in mid furrow.",
        "The hand slowly released its grip.",
        "\u2018That,\u2019 said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between dry lips, \u2018will do nicely, sir.\u2019 5 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ.",
        "Indeed, its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse.",
        "So none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of services, discounts or preferential treatment of any kind in return for editorial favours unless: a) they have made a bona fide attempt to pay for a service in the normal way; b) their lives would be otherwise in danger; c) they really want to.",
        "Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a cut, Ford always preferred to muck about with the first two.",
        "He stepped out along the street, walking briskly.",
        "The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling city air, full of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music and the distant sound of warring police tribes.",
        "He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him without asking.",
        "It contained everything he owned, which at the moment wasn\u2019t much.",
        "A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which lurched, screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window of a herbal remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off down the street, and then pretended to fall down the steps of a small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed and fed.",
        "Ford was walking north.",
        "He thought he was probably on his way to the spaceport, but he had thought that before.",
        "He knew he was going through that part of the city where people\u2019s plans often changed quite abruptly.",
        "\u2018Do you want to have a good time?\u2019 said a voice from a doorway.",
        "\u2018As far as I can tell,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019m having one.",
        "Thanks.\u2019 \u2018Are you rich?\u2019 said another.",
        "This made Ford laugh.",
        "He turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture.",
        "\u2018Do I look rich?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t know,\u2019 said the girl.",
        "\u2018Maybe, maybe not.",
        "Maybe you\u2019ll get rich.",
        "I have a very special service for rich people...\u2019 \u2018Oh yes?\u2019 said Ford, intrigued but careful.",
        "\u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018I tell them it\u2019s OK to be rich.\u2019 Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times in a row, and bass players are two a penny in Han Dold City.",
        "Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway.",
        "\u2018You what?\u2019 he said.",
        "The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow.",
        "She was tall, and had that kind of self possessed shyness which is a great trick if you can do it.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s my big number,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018I have a master\u2019s degree in social economics and can be very convincing.",
        "People love it.",
        "Especially in this city.\u2019 \u2018Goosnargh,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian word he used when he knew he should say something but didn\u2019t know what it should be.",
        "He sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that Ol\u2019 Janx Spirit and a towel.",
        "He opened the bottle and wiped the top of it with the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one intended, in that the Ol\u2019 Janx Spirit instantly killed off millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of his towel.",
        "\u2018Want some?\u2019 he said, after he\u2019d had a swig himself.",
        "She shrugged and took the proffered bottle.",
        "They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clam our of burglar alarms in the next block.",
        "\u2018As it happens, I\u2019m owed a lot of money,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018so if I ever get hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?\u2019 \u2018Sure, I\u2019ll be here,\u2019 said the girl.",
        "\u2018So how much is a lot?\u2019 \u2018Fifteen years\u2019 back pay.\u2019 \u2018For?\u2019 \u2018Writing two words.\u2019 \u2018Zarquon,\u2019 said the girl.",
        "\u2018Which one took the time?\u2019 \u2018The first one.",
        "Once I\u2019d got that the second one just came one afternoon after lunch.\u2019 A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them.",
        "It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in order to lay an ambush for the other.",
        "Cars with screaming sirens converged on the area, only to find themselves being picked off by \u2019copters which came thudding through the air between the city\u2019s mountainous tower blocks.",
        "\u2018In fact,\u2019 said Ford, having to shout now above the din, \u2018it wasn\u2019t quite like that.",
        "I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut it down.\u2019 He took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel.",
        "\u2018Then the planet got demolished,\u2019 he shouted.",
        "\u2018Really worthwhile job, eh? They\u2019ve still got to pay me, though.\u2019 \u2018You work for that thing?\u2019 the girl yelled back.",
        "\u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Good number.\u2019 \u2018You want to see the stuff I wrote?\u2019 he shouted.",
        "\u2018Before it gets erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the net.",
        "Someone must have found out by now that the planet I spent fifteen years on has been demolished.",
        "They missed it on the last few revisions, but it can\u2019t escape their notice for ever.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s getting impossible to talk, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 She shrugged and pointed upwards.",
        "There was a \u2019copter above them now which seemed to be involved in a side skirmish with the band upstairs.",
        "Smoke was billowing from the building.",
        "The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by his finger tips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his fingers with a burning guitar.",
        "The helicopter was firing at all of them.",
        "\u2018Can we move?\u2019 They wandered down the street, away from the noise.",
        "They ran into a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by the pack animal.",
        "All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the Guide.",
        "They ducked into an alleyway.",
        "Ford squatted on a garbage can while information began to flood over the screen of the Guide.",
        "He located his entry.",
        "\u2018Earth: Mostly harmless.\u2019 Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages.",
        "\u2018Here it comes,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Please wait,\u2019 said the messages.",
        "\u2018Entries are being updated over the Sub Etha Net.",
        "This entry is being revised.",
        "The system will be down for ten seconds.\u2019 At the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past.",
        "\u2018Hey look,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018if you get paid, look me up.",
        "I\u2019m a working girl, and there are people over there who need me.",
        "I gotta go.\u2019 She brushed aside Ford\u2019s half articulated protests, and left him sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into the ether.",
        "Out in the street things had calmed down a little.",
        "The police battle had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their musical differences and pursue solo careers, the street theatre group were re emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack animal, telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it would be treated with a little respect, and a little way further on the steel grey limousine was parked silently by the kerbside.",
        "The girl hurried towards it.",
        "* * * Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow was bathing Ford Prefect\u2019s face, and his eyes were slowly widening in astonishment.",
        "For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed off entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data \u2013 text, diagrams, figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on Australian beaches, yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to avoid in Los Angeles, currency deals to avoid in Istanbul, weather to avoid in London, bars to go everywhere.",
        "Pages and pages of it.",
        "It was all there, everything he had written.",
        "With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards and forwards through it, stopping here and there at various entries.",
        "\u2018Tips for aliens in New York: \u2018Land anywhere, Central Park, anywhere.",
        "No one will care, or indeed even notice.",
        "\u2018Surviving: Get a job as a cab driver immediately.",
        "A cab driver\u2019s job is to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow machines called taxis.",
        "Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know how the machine works and you can\u2019t speak the language, don\u2019t understand the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have large green antennae growing out of your head.",
        "Believe me, this is the best way of staying inconspicuous.",
        "\u2018If your body is really weird try showing it to people in the streets for money.",
        "\u2018Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling, Noxios or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East River, which is said to be richer in those lovely life giving nutrients than the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet achieved.",
        "\u2018Having fun: This is the big section.",
        "It is impossible to have more fun without electrocuting your pleasure centres...\u2019 Ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked \u2018Mode Execute Ready\u2019 instead of the now old fashioned \u2018Access Standby\u2019 which had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone age \u2018Off\u2019.",
        "This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the ground had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking, roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the loathsome yellow Vogon ships.",
        "And then at last, five seconds after the moment he had determined as being the last possible moment had already passed, the gently swinging nausea of dematerialization as he and Arthur Dent had been beamed up through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast.",
        "There was no mistake, there couldn\u2019t have been.",
        "The Earth had definitely been destroyed.",
        "Definitely, definitely.",
        "Boiled away into space.",
        "And yet here \u2013 he activated the Guide again \u2013 was his own entry on how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth, Dorset, England, which he had always prided himself on as being one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever delivered.",
        "He read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder.",
        "Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it was this, that something very weird was happening; and if something very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to be happening to him.",
        "He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to the street again.",
        "Walking north again he passed a steel grey limousine parked by the kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice saying, \u2018It\u2019s OK, honey, it\u2019s really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it.",
        "Look at the way the whole economy is structured...\u2019 Ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended in the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky.",
        "He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city, and once clear of them hurtled through the black and red pall of smoke which hung permanently above it.",
        "Ten minutes later, with all the \u2019copter\u2019s sirens blaring and its rapid fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford Prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing lights at Han Dold spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic, startled and very noisy gnat.",
        "Since he hadn\u2019t damaged it too much he was able to trade it in for a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and settled into one of its huge, voluptuous body hugging seats.",
        "This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing.",
        "\u2018Yes please,\u2019 he said to the cabin attendants whenever they glided up to offer him anything at all.",
        "He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again through the mysteriously reinstated entry on the planet Earth.",
        "He had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be able to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve.",
        "It suddenly occured to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and if he knew.",
        "* * * Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty seven light years away in a Saab, and anxious.",
        "Behind him in the back seat was a girl who had made him crack his head on the door as he climbed in.",
        "He didn\u2019t know if it was just because she was the first female of his own species that he had laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied with, with...",
        "This is absurd, he told himself.",
        "Calm down, he told himself.",
        "You are not, he continued to himself in the firmest internal voice he could muster, in a fit and rational state.",
        "You have just hitchhiked over a hundred thousand light years across the galaxy, you are very tired, a little confused and extremely vulnerable.",
        "Relax, don\u2019t panic, concentrate on breathing deeply.",
        "He twisted round in his seat.",
        "\u2018Are you sure she\u2019s all right?\u2019 he said again.",
        "Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heart thumpingly beautiful, he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was, the exact shading of her hair.",
        "And nor could he ask her anything about herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious.",
        "\u2018She\u2019s just drugged,\u2019 said her brother, shrugging, not moving his eyes from the road ahead.",
        "\u2018And that\u2019s all right, is it?\u2019 said Arthur, in alarm.",
        "\u2018Suits me,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Er,\u2019 he added after a moment\u2019s thought.",
        "The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly.",
        "After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell \u2013 the wonderful girl\u2019s brother\u2019s name was Russell, a name which, to Arthur\u2019s mind, always suggested burly men with blond moustaches and blow dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches \u2013 had quickly discovered they didn\u2019t like each other at all.",
        "Russell was a burly man.",
        "He had a blond moustache.",
        "His hair was fine and blow dried.",
        "To be fair to him \u2013 though Arthur didn\u2019t see any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it \u2013 he, Arthur, was looking pretty grim himself.",
        "A man can\u2019t cross a hundred thousand light years, mostly in other people\u2019s baggage compartments, without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had frayed a lot.",
        "\u2018She\u2019s not a junkie,\u2019 said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly thought that someone else in the car might be.",
        "\u2018She\u2019s under sedation.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s terrible,\u2019 said Arthur, twisting round to look at her again.",
        "She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways on her shoulder.",
        "Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring it.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s the matter with her, is she ill?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Russell, \u2018merely barking mad.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur, horrified.",
        "\u2018Loopy, completely bananas.",
        "I\u2019m taking her back to the hospital and telling them to have another go.",
        "They let her out while she still thought she was a hedgehog.\u2019 \u2018A hedgehog?\u2019 Russell hooted his horn fiercely at a car that came round the corner towards them halfway on to their side of the road, making them swerve.",
        "The anger seemed to make him feel better.",
        "\u2018Well, maybe not a hedgehog,\u2019 he said after he\u2019d settled down again.",
        "\u2018Though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she did.",
        "If somebody thinks they\u2019re a hedgehog, presumably you just give \u2019em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they feel better.",
        "At least medical science could deal with it, that\u2019s the point.",
        "Seems that\u2019s not good enough for Fenny, though.\u2019 \u2018Fenny...?\u2019 \u2018You know what I got her for Christmas?\u2019 \u2018Well, no.\u2019 \u2018Black\u2019s Medical Dictionary.\u2019 \u2018Nice present.\u2019 \u2018I thought so.",
        "Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical order.\u2019 \u2018You say her name is Fenny?\u2019 \u2018Yeah.",
        "Take your pick, I said.",
        "Anything in here can be dealt with.",
        "The proper drugs can be prescribed.",
        "But no, she has to have something different.",
        "Just to make life difficult.",
        "She was like that at school, you know.\u2019 \u2018Was she?\u2019 \u2018She was.",
        "Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had ever heard of.\u2019 \u2018I can see how that would be irritating,\u2019 said Arthur doubtfully.",
        "He was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny.",
        "It was a rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt might vote herself if she couldn\u2019t sustain the name Fenella properly.",
        "\u2018Not that I wasn\u2019t sympathetic,\u2019 continued Russell, \u2018but it did get a bit irritating.",
        "She was limping for months.\u2019 He slowed down.",
        "\u2018This is your turning, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Ah, no,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018five miles further on.",
        "If that\u2019s all right.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 said Russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it wasn\u2019t, and speeded up again.",
        "It was in fact Arthur\u2019s turning, but he couldn\u2019t leave without finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up.",
        "He could take either of the next two turnings.",
        "They led back to the village that had been his home, though what he would find there he hesitated to imagine.",
        "Familiar landmarks had been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the shudders that only very very normal things can create, when seen where the mind is unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar light.",
        "By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it, living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns, it was eight years since he had left, but what time had passed here he could hardly guess.",
        "Indeed, what events had passed were beyond his exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home, should not be here.",
        "Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished, utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a local regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence.",
        "\u2018Delusions,\u2019 said Russell.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur, started out of his train of thought.",
        "\u2018She says she suffers from strange delusions that she\u2019s living in the real world.",
        "It\u2019s no good telling her that she is living in the real world because she just says that\u2019s why the delusions are so strange.",
        "Don\u2019t know about you, but I find that kind of conversation pretty exhausting.",
        "Give her the tablets and piss off for a beer is my answer.",
        "I mean you can only muck about so much can\u2019t you?\u2019 Arthur frowned, not for the first time.",
        "\u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018And all this dreams and nightmare stuff.",
        "And the doctors going on about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns.\u2019 \u2018Jumps?\u2019 \u2018This,\u2019 said Fenny.",
        "Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly open but utterly vacant eyes.",
        "Whatever she was looking at wasn\u2019t in the car.",
        "Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then she was sleeping peacefully.",
        "\u2018What did she say?\u2019 he asked anxiously.",
        "\u2018She said \u201cthis\u201d.\u2019 \u2018This what?\u2019 \u2018This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso\u2019s tweezers.",
        "She\u2019s barking mad, I thought I\u2019d mentioned that.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t seem to care very much.\u2019 Arthur tried to say it as matter of factly as possible but it didn\u2019t seem to work.",
        "\u2018Look, buster...\u2019 \u2018OK, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "It\u2019s none of my business.",
        "I didn\u2019t mean it to sound like that,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I know you care a lot, obviously,\u2019 he added, lying.",
        "\u2018I know that you have to deal with it somehow.",
        "You\u2019ll have to excuse me.",
        "I just hitched from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula.\u2019 He stared furiously out of the window.",
        "He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in his head on this night as he returned to the home that he thought had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he knew nothing other than that she had said \u2018this\u2019 to him, and that he wouldn\u2019t wish her brother on a Vogon.",
        "\u2018So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?\u2019 he went on to say as quickly as he could.",
        "\u2018Look, this is my sister, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m talking to you about...\u2019 \u2018OK, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Perhaps you\u2019d better let me out.",
        "This is...\u2019 At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm which had passed them by suddenly erupted again.",
        "Lightning belted through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something which closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a sieve.",
        "Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky blattered at them.",
        "He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating to pass a lorry marked \u2018McKenna\u2019s All Weather Haulage\u2019.",
        "The tension eased as the rain subsided.",
        "\u2018It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in the reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and everything, you remember?\u2019 Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had just hitch hiked back from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it would only confuse matters further.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018That was the moment she cracked up.",
        "She was in a caf\u00e9 somewhere.",
        "Rickmansworth.",
        "Don\u2019t know what she was doing there, but that was where she cracked up.",
        "Apparently she stood up, calmly announced that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed screaming into an egg sandwich.\u2019 Arthur winced.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m very sorry to hear that,\u2019 he said a little stiffly.",
        "Russell made a sort of grumping noise.",
        "\u2018So what,\u2019 said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together, \u2018was the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?\u2019 \u2018Bobbing up and down, of course.",
        "He was dead.\u2019 \u2018But what...\u2019 \u2018Come on, you remember all that stuff.",
        "The hallucinations.",
        "Everyone said it was a cock up, the CIA trying experiments into drug warfare or something.",
        "Some crackpot theory that instead of invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to make everyone think they\u2019d been invaded.\u2019 \u2018What hallucinations were those exactly...?\u2019 said Arthur in a rather quiet voice.",
        "\u2018What do you mean, what hallucinations? I\u2019m talking about all that stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and saying we\u2019re going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the effect wore off.",
        "The CIA denied it which meant it must be true.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s head went a little swimmy.",
        "His hand grabbed at something to steady himself, and gripped it tightly.",
        "His mouth made little opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say something, but nothing emerged.",
        "\u2018Anyway,\u2019 continued Russell, \u2018whatever drug it was it didn\u2019t seem to wear off so fast with Fenny.",
        "I was all for suing the CIA, but a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a lunatic asylum with a banana, so...\u2019 He shrugged.",
        "\u2018The Vogon...\u2019 squeaked Arthur.",
        "\u2018The yellow ships...",
        "vanished?\u2019 \u2018Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations,\u2019 said Russell, and looked at Arthur oddly.",
        "\u2018You trying to say you don\u2019t remember any of this? Where have you been, for heaven\u2019s sake?\u2019 This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he half leapt out of his seat with shock.",
        "\u2018Christ!!!\u2019 yelled Russell, fighting to control the car which was suddenly trying to skid.",
        "He pulled it out of the path of an oncoming lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank.",
        "As the car lurched to a halt, the girl in the back was thrown against Russell\u2019s seat and collapsed awkwardly.",
        "Arthur twisted round in horror.",
        "\u2018Is she all right?\u2019 he blurted out.",
        "Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow dried hair.",
        "He tugged at his blond moustache.",
        "He turned to Arthur.",
        "\u2018Would you please,\u2019 he said, \u2018let go of the handbrake?\u2019 6 From here it was a four mile walk to his village: a mile further to the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of winding country lane.",
        "The Saab seethed off into the night.",
        "Arthur watched it go, as stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be totally blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had merely been wearing too large a hat.",
        "He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even some good painful blisters, would help to reassure him of his own existence at least, if not his sanity.",
        "It was 10.30 when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which there had hung for many years a battered old Guinness clock which featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather amusingly down its throat.",
        "This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which first his house and then the entire planet Earth had been demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished.",
        "No, damn it, had been demolished, because if it hadn\u2019t then where the bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and how had he got there if not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the appalling Russell had just been telling him were merely drug induced hallucinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what was he currently standing on...? He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn\u2019t going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times he\u2019d been over it.",
        "He started again.",
        "This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to sort out later had happened, and...",
        "It still didn\u2019t make sense.",
        "He started again.",
        "This was the pub in which...",
        "This was a pub.",
        "Pubs served drinks and he couldn\u2019t half do with one.",
        "Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived at a conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it wasn\u2019t the one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the door.",
        "And stopped.",
        "A small black wire haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl.",
        "Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well.",
        "It belonged to an advertising friend of his, and was called Know Nothing Bozo because the way its hair stood up on its head reminded people of the President of the United States of America, and the dog knew Arthur, or at least should do.",
        "It was a stupid dog which could not even read an autocue, which was why some people had protested about its name, but it should at least have been able to recognize Arthur instead of standing there, hackles raised, as if Arthur was the most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble witted life.",
        "This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself.",
        "Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context, he had to admit that the dog had a point.",
        "He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his present condition would excite comment of a raucous kind, and worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill equipped to deal with.",
        "Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know Nothing Bozo the Non Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from one of Will\u2019s own commercials for being incapable of knowing which dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over it.",
        "Will would definitely be in there.",
        "Here was his dog, there was his car, a grey Porsche 928S with a sign in the back window which read, \u2018My other car is also a Porsche.\u2019 Damn him.",
        "He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something he hadn\u2019t known before.",
        "Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and under scrupulous bastards Arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his car every August so that he could tell people his accountant made him do it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying like hell to stop him, what with all the alimony he had to pay, and so on \u2013 and this was the same car Arthur remembered him having before.",
        "The number plate proclaimed its year.",
        "Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had occurred at the beginning of September, less than six or seven months could have passed here.",
        "He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know Nothing Bozo jump up and down yapping at him.",
        "He was suddenly stunned by a realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now an alien on his own world.",
        "Try as they might, no one was even going to be able to believe his story.",
        "Not only did it sound perfectly potty, but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts.",
        "Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility that he had made some extraordinary mistake? The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every detail \u2013 every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he could sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams, its unauthentic cast iron light fittings, its bar sticky with beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all over their breasts.",
        "It was all the stuff of his home, his world.",
        "He even knew this blasted dog.",
        "\u2018Hey, Know Nothing!\u2019 The sound of Will Smithers\u2019 voice meant he had to decide what to do quickly.",
        "If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the whole circus would begin.",
        "To hide would only postpone the moment, and it was bitterly cold now.",
        "The fact that it was Will made the choice easier.",
        "It wasn\u2019t that Arthur disliked him as such \u2013 Will was quite fun.",
        "It was just that he was fun in such an exhausting way because, being in advertising, he always wanted you to know how much fun he was having and where he had got his jacket from.",
        "Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van.",
        "\u2018Hey, Know Nothing, what\u2019s up?\u2019 The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying jacket that he\u2019d got a mate of his at the Road Research Laboratory to crash a car into specially, in order to get that battered look.",
        "Know Nothing yelped with delight and, having got the attention it wanted, was happy to forget Arthur.",
        "Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with the dog.",
        "\u2018Commies!\u2019 they all shouted at the dog in chorus.",
        "\u2018Commies, commies, commies!!!\u2019 The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic rage.",
        "They all laughed and cheered it on, then gradually dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night.",
        "Well, that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the van, this is quite definitely the planet I remember.",
        "7 His house was still there.",
        "How or why, he had no idea.",
        "He had decided to go and have a look while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else had gone.",
        "And there it was.",
        "He hurriedly let himself in with a key he kept under a stone frog in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing.",
        "He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from.",
        "The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing accumulation of junk mail on the doormat.",
        "It jammed itself stuck on what he would later discover were fourteen identical, personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for non payment of bills on a credit card he didn\u2019t have, thirty three identical letters saying that he personally had been specially selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he wanted and where he was going in today\u2019s sophisticated jet setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten.",
        "He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a heap of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing.",
        "He collapsed, panting, on to his cold, musty smelling bed and for a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning round his head in the way it obviously wanted to.",
        "When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit, Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to come on.",
        "To his surprise it did.",
        "This appealed to Arthur\u2019s sense of logic.",
        "Since the Electricity Board cut him off without fail every time he paid his bill, it seemed only reasonable that they should leave him connected when he didn\u2019t.",
        "Sending them money obviously only drew attention to yourself.",
        "The room was much as he had left it, i.e.",
        "festeringly untidy, though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust.",
        "Half read books and magazines nestled amongst piles of half used towels.",
        "Half pairs of socks reclined in half drunk cups of coffee.",
        "What was once a half eaten sandwich had now half turned into something that Arthur entirely didn\u2019t want to know about.",
        "Bung a fork of lightning through this lot, he thought to himself, and you\u2019d start the evolution of life off all over again.",
        "There was only one thing in the room that was different.",
        "For a moment or so he couldn\u2019t see what the one thing that was different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting dust.",
        "Then his eyes caught it and stopped.",
        "It was next to a battered old television on which it was only possible to watch Open University Study Courses, because if it tried to show anything more exciting it would break down.",
        "It was a box.",
        "Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it.",
        "It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to it.",
        "It was a cubic grey box, just over a foot on a side.",
        "It was tied with a single grey ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top.",
        "He got up, walked over and touched it in surprise.",
        "Whatever it was was clearly gift wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was waiting for him to open it.",
        "Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed.",
        "He brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon.",
        "The top of the box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box.",
        "He untucked it and looked into the box.",
        "In it was a glass globe, nestling in fine grey tissue paper.",
        "He drew it out, carefully.",
        "It wasn\u2019t a proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as Arthur realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim.",
        "It was a bowl.",
        "A fish bowl.",
        "It was made of the most wonderful glass, perfectly transparent, yet with an extraordinary silver grey quality as if crystal and slate had gone into its making.",
        "Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands.",
        "It was one of the most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely perplexed by it.",
        "He looked into the box, but other than the tissue paper there was nothing.",
        "On the outside of the box there was nothing.",
        "He turned the bowl round again.",
        "It was wonderful.",
        "It was exquisite.",
        "But it was a fish bowl.",
        "He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed possible, and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea dream.",
        "Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowl\u2019s surface.",
        "He held it up, adjusting the angle to the light, and suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed on the glass.",
        "\u2018So Long,\u2019 they said, \u2018and Thanks...\u2019 And that was all.",
        "He blinked, and understood nothing.",
        "For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and around, held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for its mesmerizing chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy letters but could find none.",
        "Finally he stood up, filled the bowl with water from the tap and put it back on the table next to the television.",
        "He shook the little Babel fish from his ear and dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl.",
        "He wouldn\u2019t be needing it any more, except for watching foreign movies.",
        "He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light.",
        "He lay still and quiet.",
        "He absorbed the enveloping darkness, slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his breathing, gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his eyes and was completely incapable of getting to sleep.",
        "* * * The night was uneasy with rain.",
        "The rain clouds themselves had now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on a small transport caf\u00e9 just outside Bournemouth, but the sky through which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didn\u2019t know what else it might not do if further provoked.",
        "The moon was out in a watery way.",
        "It looked like a ball of paper from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the washing machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it was an old shopping list or a five pound note.",
        "The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that\u2019s trying to decide what sort of mood it\u2019s in tonight, and a bell somewhere chimed midnight.",
        "A skylight creaked open.",
        "It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because the frame was slightly rotten and the hinge had at some time in its life been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was open.",
        "A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof.",
        "It stood and watched the sky in silence.",
        "The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild looking creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an hour ago.",
        "Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared with the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing ecosystem and all.",
        "Instead, there was Arthur Dent the smooth and casual, in corduroys and a chunky sweater.",
        "His hair was cropped and washed, his chin clean shaven.",
        "Only the eyes still said that whatever it was the Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like it please to stop.",
        "They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain.",
        "There had been no surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience.",
        "The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted.",
        "He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a far river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy rainclouds parked somewhere away to the south.",
        "He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was something he hadn\u2019t expected.",
        "He knew that it felt good to curl your toes in the earth, but he\u2019d never realized it could feel quite as good as that.",
        "He could sense an almost unseemly wave of pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the New Forest.",
        "He must try this summer, he thought, and see what having leaves felt like.",
        "From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by anything else it ever encountered, for they were creatures who learned very little on their journey through life, and would be startled to see the sun rising in the morning, and astonished by all the green stuff in the fields.",
        "He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled by the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being startled by a clump of trees the day before that.",
        "He could go further and further back, but it got dull because all it consisted of was sheep being startled by things they\u2019d been startled by the day before.",
        "He left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in developing ripples.",
        "It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds of them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some terribly excited, one fractured.",
        "One fractured.",
        "He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in Pelmanism.",
        "He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is.",
        "He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to find her; but he could not.",
        "By straining too much for it, he could feel he was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed the search and let his mind wander more easily once more.",
        "And again, he felt the fracture.",
        "Again he couldn\u2019t find it.",
        "This time, whatever his instinct was busy telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn\u2019t certain that it was Fenny or \u2013 perhaps it was a different fracture this time.",
        "It had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more general feeling of fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not a mind at all.",
        "It was different.",
        "He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling, seeping, sinking.",
        "He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its life, swelling with its tides, turning with its weight.",
        "Always the fracture kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache.",
        "And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was time, the tides of it were days receding.",
        "The fracture he had sensed, the second fracture, lay in the distance before him across the land, the thickness of a single hair across the dreaming landscape of the days of Earth.",
        "And suddenly he was upon it.",
        "He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space, spinning, falling.",
        "Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths.",
        "He woke.",
        "A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his forehead.",
        "The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he.",
        "His shoulders dropped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his fingers.",
        "At last he was sleepy as well as very tired.",
        "As to what it meant, if it meant anything at all, he would think about in the morning; for now he would go to bed and sleep.",
        "His own bed, his own sleep.",
        "He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was.",
        "It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its rather dull blockish shape.",
        "He looked about him and noticed that he was about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his neighbours, John Ainsworth.",
        "His rose bushes were carefully tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes and labelled, and Arthur wondered what he was doing above them.",
        "He wondered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground.",
        "He picked himself up, brushed himself down and hobbled back to his house on a sprained ankle.",
        "He undressed and toppled into bed.",
        "While he was asleep the phone rang again.",
        "It rang for fully fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice.",
        "It never, however, stood a chance of waking him up.",
        "8 Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed, overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed at all to discover it was the middle of February.",
        "He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy things in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for two minutes.",
        "Since they made no attempt to move within that time he called them breakfast and ate them.",
        "Between them they killed a virulent space disease he\u2019d picked up without knowing it in the Flargathon Gas Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would have killed off half the population of the Western Hemisphere, blinded the other half and driven everyone else psychotic and sterile, so the Earth was lucky there.",
        "He felt strong, he felt healthy.",
        "He vigorously cleared away the junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat.",
        "Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring while he maintained a moment\u2019s respectful silence.",
        "Whoever it was would ring back if it was important.",
        "He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside.",
        "There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles of junk \u2013 some documents from the council relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into the whole bypass scheme in the area; there was also an old letter from Greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he occasionally made contributions, asking for help with their scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity, and some postcards from friends vaguely complaining that he never got in touch these days.",
        "He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file which he marked \u2018Things To Do\u2019.",
        "Since he was feeling so vigorous and dynamic that morning, he even added the word \u2018Urgent!\u2019 He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega Market.",
        "The slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua Centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other language and therefore entirely pointless for a duty free shop at a spaceport.",
        "The bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away.",
        "He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to Earth, kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the A303.",
        "He had lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes of space he had traversed.",
        "He had lost The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "Well, he told himself, this time I really won\u2019t be needing it again.",
        "He had some calls to make.",
        "He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply brazen it out.",
        "He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department head.",
        "\u2018Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here.",
        "Look, sorry I haven\u2019t been in for six months but I\u2019ve gone mad.\u2019 \u2018Oh, not to worry.",
        "Thought it was probably something like that.",
        "Happens here all the time.",
        "How soon can we expect you?\u2019 \u2018When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?\u2019 \u2018Sometime in spring, I think.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll be in shortly after that.\u2019 \u2018Rightyho.\u2019 He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of numbers to try.",
        "\u2018Oh hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning to see if I could have a word with Fenella, er...",
        "Fenella \u2013 Good Lord, silly me, I\u2019ll forget my own name next, er, Fenella \u2013 isn\u2019t this ridiculous? Patient of yours, dark haired girl, came in last night...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have any patients called Fenella.\u2019 \u2018Oh, don\u2019t you? I meant Fiona, of course, we just call her Fen...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sorry, goodbye.\u2019 Click.",
        "Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on his mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub and parade it a little.",
        "He had had the perfect idea for explaining away every inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him last night.",
        "\u2018Arthur!!!!\u2019 He grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him from all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful time he\u2019d had in Southern California.",
        "9 He accepted another pint and took a pull at it.",
        "\u2018Of course, I had my own personal alchemist too.\u2019 \u2018You what?\u2019 He was getting silly and he knew it.",
        "Exuberance and Hall and Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the first effects it has is to stop you being wary of things, and the point at which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more was the point at which he started instead to get inventive.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he insisted with a happy glazed smile.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s why I\u2019ve lost so much weight.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said his audience.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he said again.",
        "\u2018The Californians have rediscovered alchemy.",
        "Oh yes.\u2019 He smiled again.",
        "\u2018Only,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s in a much more useful form than that which in...\u2019 He paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble in his head.",
        "\u2018In which the ancients used to practise it.",
        "Or at least,\u2019 he added, \u2018failed to practise it.",
        "They couldn\u2019t get it to work, you know.",
        "Nostradamus and that lot.",
        "Couldn\u2019t cut it.\u2019 \u2018Nostradamus?\u2019 said one of his audience.",
        "\u2018I didn\u2019t think he was an alchemist,\u2019 said another.",
        "\u2018I thought,\u2019 said a third, \u2018he was a seer.\u2019 \u2018He became a seer,\u2019 said Arthur to his audience, the component parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, \u2018because he was such a lousy alchemist.",
        "You should know that.\u2019 He took another pull at his beer.",
        "It was something he had not tasted for eight years.",
        "He tasted it and tasted it.",
        "\u2018What has alchemy got to do,\u2019 asked a bit of the audience, \u2018with losing weight?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m glad you asked that,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Very glad.",
        "And I will now tell you what the connection is between...\u2019 He paused.",
        "\u2018Between those two things.",
        "The things you mentioned.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you.\u2019 He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts.",
        "It was like watching oil tankers doing three point turns in the English Channel.",
        "\u2018They\u2019ve discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold,\u2019 he said, in a sudden blurt of coherence.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re kidding.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018no,\u2019 he corrected himself, \u2018they have.\u2019 He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely.",
        "\u2018Have you been to California?\u2019 he demanded.",
        "\u2018Do you know the sort of stuff they do there?\u2019 Three members of his audience said they had and that he was talking nonsense.",
        "\u2018You haven\u2019t seen anything,\u2019 insisted Arthur.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he added, because someone was offering to buy another round.",
        "\u2018The evidence,\u2019 he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by more than a couple of inches, \u2018is before your eyes.",
        "Fourteen hours in a trance,\u2019 he said, \u2018in a tank.",
        "In a trance.",
        "I was in a tank.",
        "I think,\u2019 he added after a thoughtful pause, \u2018I already said that.\u2019 He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed.",
        "He composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going to be something about the tank needing to be orientated along a line dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a baseline drawn between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to say it when he decided to give it a miss.",
        "\u2018Long time,\u2019 he said instead, \u2018in a tank.",
        "In a trance.\u2019 He looked round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following attentively.",
        "He resumed.",
        "\u2018Where was I?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018In a trance,\u2019 said one.",
        "\u2018In a tank,\u2019 said another.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Thank you.",
        "And slowly,\u2019 he said, pressing onwards, \u2018slowly, slowly slowly, all your excess body fat turns...",
        "to...\u2019 he paused for effect, \u2018subcoo...",
        "subyoo...",
        "subtoocay...\u2019 \u2013 he paused for breath \u2013 \u2018subcutaneous gold, which you can have surgically removed.",
        "Getting out of the tank is hell.",
        "What did you say?\u2019 \u2018I was just clearing my throat.\u2019 \u2018I think you doubt me.\u2019 \u2018I was clearing my throat.\u2019 \u2018She was clearing her throat,\u2019 confirmed a significant part of the audience in a low rumble.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018all right.",
        "And you then split the proceeds...\u2019 he paused again for a maths break, \u2018fifty fifty with the alchemist.",
        "Make a lot of money!\u2019 He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces.",
        "He felt very affronted by this.",
        "\u2018How else,\u2019 he demanded, \u2018could I afford to have my face dropped?\u2019 Friendly arms began to help him home.",
        "\u2018Listen,\u2019 he protested, as the cold February breeze brushed his face, \u2018looking lived in is all the rage in California at the moment.",
        "You\u2019ve got to look as if you\u2019ve seen the Galaxy.",
        "Life, I mean.",
        "You\u2019ve got to look as if you\u2019ve seen life.",
        "That\u2019s what I got.",
        "A face drop.",
        "Give me eight years, I said.",
        "I hope being thirty doesn\u2019t come back into fashion or I\u2019ve wasted a lot of money.\u2019 He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued to help him along the lane to his house.",
        "\u2018Got in yesterday,\u2019 he mumbled.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m very very very happy to be home.",
        "Or somewhere very like it...\u2019 \u2018Jet lag,\u2019 muttered one of his friends.",
        "\u2018Long trip from California.",
        "Really mucks you up for a couple of days.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been there at all,\u2019 muttered another.",
        "\u2018I wonder where he has been.",
        "And what\u2019s happened to him.\u2019 * After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a bit.",
        "He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the journey.",
        "He wondered how he was going to find Fenny.",
        "He sat and looked at the fish bowl.",
        "He tapped it again, and despite being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which was gulping its way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before.",
        "Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself.",
        "He wondered who, and for what.",
        "10 \u2018At the third stroke it will be one...",
        "thirty two...",
        "and twenty seconds.",
        "\u2018Beep...",
        "beep...",
        "beep.\u2019 Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction, realized that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out loud, a wicked laugh.",
        "He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub Etha Net to the ship\u2019s superb hi fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing song voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin.",

        "\u2018One...",
        "fifty nine...\u2019 His original plan had been to close down all external signalling and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he\u2019d had an idea he preferred.",
        "It would now emit one single continuous beam, pencil thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the planet of the signal\u2019s origin, which it would not reach for four hundred years, travelling at light speed, but where it would probably cause something of a stir when it did.",

        "Almost perfect.",

        "He ran again the computer simulation of the launching of the ship\u2019s little Escape O Buggy, balancing actions, reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical poetry of motion, and saw that it was good.",
        "Before he left, he turned out the lights.",
        "As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on the beginning of its three day journey to the orbiting space station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey still.",

        "People had such extraordinarily short memories, including him.",

        "One effect that still lingered, though, was his joy at being back.",
        "Now that the Earth\u2019s atmosphere had closed over his head for good, he thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him extraordinary pleasure.",
        "Looking at the silvery sparkle of the raindrops he felt he had to protest.",
        "\u2018Well, I like them,\u2019 he said suddenly, \u2018and for all the obvious reasons.",
        "They\u2019re light and refreshing.",
        "They sparkle and make you feel good.\u2019 The man snorted derisively.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s what they all say,\u2019 he said, and glowered darkly from his corner seat.",
        "He was a lorry driver.",
        "Arthur knew this because his opening, unprovoked remark had been, \u2018I\u2019m a lorry driver.",
        "I hate driving in the rain.",
        "Ironic, isn\u2019t it? Bloody ironic.\u2019 If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt, affable but not encouraging.",
        "But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred now.",
        "\u2018They all say that about bloody April showers,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018So bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather.\u2019 He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say something extraordinary about the government.",
        "\u2018What I want to know is this,\u2019 he said, \u2018if it\u2019s going to be nice weather, why,\u2019 he almost spat, \u2018can\u2019t it be nice without bloody raining?\u2019 Arthur gave up.",
        "He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold.",
        "\u2018Well, there you go,\u2019 he said and instead got up himself.",
        "\u2018Bye.\u2019 He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back through the car park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of rain on his face.",
        "There was even, he noticed, a hint of a rainbow glistening over the Devon hills.",
        "He enjoyed that too.",
        "He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf GTi, squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol pumps and onto the slip road back towards the motorway.",
        "He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had closed finally and for ever above his head.",
        "He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his galactic travels had dragged him.",
        "He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, dirty, rainbow hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe.",
        "He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things.",
        "The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a small umbrella.",
        "His jaw sagged.",
        "He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over.",
        "\u2018Fenny!\u2019 he shouted.",
        "Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit her instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it open at her.",
        "It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then bowled wildly away across the road.",
        "\u2018Shit!\u2019 yelled Arthur as helpfully as he could, leapt out of his own door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKenna\u2019s All Weather Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny\u2019s umbrella instead.",
        "The lorry swept along the motorway and away.",
        "The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy long legs, expiring sadly on the ground.",
        "Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a little.",
        "He picked it up.",
        "\u2018Er,\u2019 he said.",
        "There didn\u2019t seem to be a lot of point in offering the thing back to her.",
        "\u2018How did you know my name?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Er, well,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Look, I\u2019ll get you another one...\u2019 He looked at her and tailed off.",
        "She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale and serious face.",
        "Standing still, alone, she seemed almost sombre, like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a formal garden.",
        "She seemed to be looking at something other than what she looked as if she was looking at.",
        "But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly arrived from somewhere.",
        "Warmth and life flooded into her face, and impossibly graceful movement into her body.",
        "The effect was very disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell.",
        "She grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself into the front seat.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t worry about the umbrella,\u2019 she said to him as she climbed in.",
        "\u2018It was my brother\u2019s and he can\u2019t have liked it or he wouldn\u2019t have given it to me.\u2019 She laughed and pulled on her seatbelt.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re not a friend of my brother\u2019s, are you?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 Her voice was the only part of her which didn\u2019t say \u2018Good\u2019.",
        "Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite extraordinary to Arthur.",
        "He felt, as he let the car pull slowly away, that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that neither of these functions were vital to his driving or they were in trouble.",
        "So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother\u2019s car, the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his nightmare years in the stars, had not been the unbalance of the moment, or, if it had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced now, and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well balanced people are supposed to be balancing on.",
        "\u2018So...\u2019 he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an exciting start.",
        "\u2018He was meant to pick me up \u2013 my brother \u2013 but phoned to say he couldn\u2019t make it.",
        "I asked about buses but the man started to look at a calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch.",
        "So.\u2019 \u2018So.\u2019 \u2018So here I am.",
        "And what I would like to know, is how you know my name.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps we ought to first sort out,\u2019 said Arthur, looking back over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic, \u2018where I\u2019m taking you.\u2019 Very close, he hoped, or a long way.",
        "Close would mean she lived near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there.",
        "\u2018I\u2019d like to go to Taunton,\u2019 she said, \u2018please.",
        "If that\u2019s all right.",
        "It\u2019s not far.",
        "You can drop me at...\u2019 \u2018You live in Taunton?\u2019 he said, hoping that he\u2019d managed to sound merely curious rather than ecstatic.",
        "Taunton was wonderfully close to him.",
        "He could...",
        "\u2018No, London,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s a train in just under an hour.\u2019 It was the worst thing possible.",
        "Taunton was only minutes away up the motorway.",
        "He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering with horror heard himself saying, \u2018Oh, I can take you to London.",
        "Let me take you to London...\u2019 Bungling idiot.",
        "Why on earth had he said \u2018let\u2019 in that stupid way? He was behaving like a twelve year old.",
        "\u2018Are you going to London?\u2019 she asked.",
        "\u2018I wasn\u2019t,\u2019 he said, \u2018but...\u2019 Bungling idiot.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s very kind of you,\u2019 she said, \u2018but really no.",
        "I like to go by train.\u2019 And suddenly she was gone.",
        "Or rather, that part of her which brought her to life was gone.",
        "She looked rather distantly out of the window and hummed lightly to herself.",
        "He couldn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he\u2019d blown it.",
        "Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction to centuries of accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not behave like this.",
        "Taunton 5 miles, said the signpost.",
        "He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled.",
        "He was going to have to do something dramatic.",
        "\u2018Fenny,\u2019 he said.",
        "She glanced round sharply at him.",
        "\u2018You still haven\u2019t told me how...\u2019 \u2018Listen,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I will tell you, though the story is rather strange.",
        "Very strange.\u2019 She was still looking at him, but said nothing.",
        "\u2018Listen...\u2019 \u2018You said that.\u2019 \u2018Did I? Oh.",
        "There are things I must talk to you about, and things I must tell you...",
        "a story I must tell you which would...\u2019 He was thrashing about.",
        "He wanted something along the lines of \u2018Thy knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine\u2019 but didn\u2019t think he could carry it off and didn\u2019t like the hedgehog reference.",
        "which would take more than five miles,\u2019 he settled for in the end, rather lamely he was afraid.",
        "\u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018Just supposing,\u2019 he said, \u2018just supposing\u2019 \u2013 he didn\u2019t know what was coming next, so he thought he\u2019d just sit back and listen \u2013 \u2018that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very important to me, and that, though you didn\u2019t know it, I was very important to you, but it all went for nothing because we only had five miles and I was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say something very important to someone I\u2019ve only just met and not crash into lorries at the same time, what would you say...\u2019 he paused helplessly, and looked at her, \u2018I...",
        "should do?\u2019 \u2018Watch the road!\u2019 she yelped.",
        "\u2018Shit!\u2019 He narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred Italian washing machines in a German lorry.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, \u2018you should buy me a drink before my train goes.\u2019 12 There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of pallor to the pork pies.",
        "Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches.",
        "There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreigners do.",
        "\u2018Make \u2019em dry,\u2019 is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness, \u2018make \u2019em rubbery.",
        "If you have to keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing \u2019em once a week.\u2019 It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have been.",
        "They\u2019re not altogether clear what those sins are, and don\u2019t want to know either.",
        "Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about.",
        "But whatever sins they are are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat.",
        "If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages which sit next to them.",
        "Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef\u2019s hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone, among his cats on a back stair in Stepney.",
        "The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific.",
        "\u2018There must be somewhere better,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018No time,\u2019 said Fenny, glancing at her watch.",
        "\u2018My train leaves in half an hour.\u2019 They sat at a small wobbly table.",
        "On it were some dirty glasses, and some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them.",
        "Arthur got Fenny a tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas in it.",
        "And a couple of sausages.",
        "He didn\u2019t know why.",
        "He bought them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass.",
        "The barman dunked Arthur\u2019s change in a pool of beer on the bar, for which Arthur thanked him.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 said Fenny, glancing at her watch, \u2018tell me what it is you have to tell me.\u2019 She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur\u2019s heart sank.",
        "Hardly, he felt, the most conducive setting to try to explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive, that in a sort of out of body dream he had had a telepathic sense that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected with the fact that, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, the Earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, something which he alone on Earth knew anything about, having virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and he needed to go to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible.",
        "\u2018Fenny,\u2019 he started.",
        "\u2018I wonder if you\u2019d like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It\u2019s just a little one.\u2019 He glanced up sharply.",
        "\u2018To raise money for Anjie who\u2019s retiring.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018And needs a kidney machine.\u2019 He was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle aged woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot.",
        "She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a collecting tin.",
        "\u2018Only ten pence each,\u2019 she said, \u2018so you could probably even buy two.",
        "Without breaking the bank!\u2019 She gave a tinkly little laugh and then a curiously long sigh.",
        "Saying \u2018Without breaking the bank\u2019 had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since some GIs had been billeted on her in the war.",
        "\u2018Er, yes, all right,\u2019 said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his pocket and producing a couple of coins.",
        "With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was such a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to Arthur.",
        "\u2018I do hope you win,\u2019 she said with a smile that suddenly snapped together like a piece of advanced origami, \u2018the prizes are so nice.\u2019 \u2018Yes, thank you,\u2019 said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather brusquely and glancing at his watch.",
        "He turned towards Fenny.",
        "So did the woman with the raffle tickets.",
        "\u2018And what about you, young lady?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s for Anjie\u2019s kidney machine.",
        "She\u2019s retiring, you see.",
        "Yes?\u2019 She hoisted the little smile even further up her face.",
        "She would have to stop and let it go soon or the skin would surely split.",
        "\u2018Er, look, here you are,\u2019 said Arthur, and pushed a fifty pence piece at her in the hope that that would see her off.",
        "\u2018Oh, we are in the money, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 said the woman, with a long smiling sigh.",
        "\u2018Down from London, are we?\u2019 Arthur wished she wouldn\u2019t talk so bloody slowly.",
        "\u2018No, that\u2019s all right, really,\u2019 he said with a wave of his hand, and she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five tickets, one by one.",
        "\u2018Oh, but you must have your tickets,\u2019 insisted the woman, \u2018or you won\u2019t be able to claim your prize.",
        "They\u2019re very nice prizes, you know.",
        "Very suitable.\u2019 Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he could.",
        "The woman turned to Fenny once again.",
        "\u2018And now, what about...\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 Arthur nearly yelled.",
        "\u2018These are for her,\u2019 he explained, brandishing the five new tickets.",
        "\u2018Oh, I see! How nice!\u2019 She smiled sickeningly at both of them.",
        "\u2018Well, I do hope you...\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 snapped Arthur, \u2018thank you.\u2019 The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs.",
        "Arthur turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was rocking with silent laughter.",
        "He sighed and smiled.",
        "\u2018Where were we?\u2019 \u2018You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s why I asked if you were a friend of my brother\u2019s.",
        "Or half brother, really.",
        "He\u2019s the only one who calls me Fenny, and I\u2019m not fond of him for it.\u2019 \u2018So what\u2019s...?\u2019 \u2018Fenchurch.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Fenchurch.\u2019 \u2018Fenchurch.\u2019 She looked at him sternly.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018and I\u2019m watching you like a lynx to see if you\u2019re going to ask the same silly question that everyone asks me till I want to scream.",
        "I shall be cross and disappointed if you do.",
        "Plus I shall scream.",
        "So watch it.\u2019 She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and peered at him from behind it.",
        "\u2018Oh,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s a little unfair, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Fine.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 she said with a laugh, \u2018you can ask me.",
        "Might as well get it over with.",
        "Better than have you call me Fenny all the time.\u2019 \u2018Presumably...\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so generous when I spoke to you before...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 snapped Arthur.",
        "The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty book of cloakroom tickets was waving the two last ones under his nose.",
        "\u2018I thought I\u2019d give the opportunity to you, because the prizes are so nice.\u2019 She wrinkled up her nose a little confidentially.",
        "\u2018Very tasteful.",
        "I know you\u2019ll like them.",
        "And it is for Anjie\u2019s retirement present, you see.",
        "We want to give her...\u2019 \u2018A kidney machine, yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Here.\u2019 He held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the tickets.",
        "A thought seemed to strike the woman.",
        "It struck her very slowly.",
        "You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach.",
        "\u2018Oh dear,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u2019 She peered anxiously at both of them.",
        "\u2018No, it\u2019s fine,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Everything that could possibly be fine,\u2019 he insisted, \u2018is fine.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he added.",
        "\u2018I say,\u2019 she said, in a delighted ecstacy of worry, \u2018you\u2019re not...",
        "in love, are you?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s very hard to say,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018We haven\u2019t had a chance to talk yet.\u2019 He glanced at Fenchurch.",
        "She was grinning.",
        "The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll let you see the prizes in a minute,\u2019 she said, and left.",
        "Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it hard to say whether he was in love with.",
        "\u2018You were about to ask me,\u2019 she said, \u2018a question.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018We can do it together if you like,\u2019 said Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018Was I found...\u2019 \u2018...",
        "in a handbag...\u2019 joined in Arthur.",
        "in the Left Luggage Office...\u2019 they said together.",
        "at Fenchurch Street Station,\u2019 they finished.",
        "\u2018And the answer,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018is no.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I was conceived there.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I was con\u2014\u2019 \u2018In the Left Luggage Office?\u2019 hooted Arthur.",
        "\u2018No, of course not.",
        "Don\u2019t be silly.",
        "What would my parents be doing in the Left Luggage Office?\u2019 she said, rather taken aback by the suggestion.",
        "\u2018Well, I don\u2019t know,\u2019 spluttered Arthur, \u2018or rather...\u2019 \u2018It was in the ticket queue.\u2019 \u2018The...\u2019 \u2018The ticket queue.",
        "Or so they claim.",
        "They refuse to elaborate.",
        "They only say you wouldn\u2019t believe how bored it is possible to get in the ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station.\u2019 She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch.",
        "Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m going to have to go in a minute or two,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018and you haven\u2019t begun to tell me whatever this terrifically extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your chest.\u2019 \u2018Why don\u2019t you let me drive you to London?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s Saturday, I\u2019ve got nothing particular to do, I\u2019d...\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018thank you, it\u2019s sweet of you, but no.",
        "I need to be by myself for a couple of days.\u2019 She smiled and shrugged.",
        "\u2018But...\u2019 \u2018You can tell me another time.",
        "I\u2019ll give you my number.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him.",
        "\u2018Now we can relax,\u2019 she said with a slow smile which filled Arthur till he thought he would burst.",
        "\u2018Fenchurch,\u2019 he said, enjoying the name as he said it.",
        "\u2018I\u2014\u2019 \u2018A box,\u2019 said a trailing voice, \u2018of cherry brandy liqueurs, and also, and I know you\u2019ll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish bagpipe music...\u2019 \u2018Yes, thank you, very nice,\u2019 insisted Arthur.",
        "\u2018I just thought I\u2019d let you have a look at them,\u2019 said the permed woman, \u2018as you\u2019re down from London...\u2019 She was holding them out proudly for Arthur to see.",
        "He could see that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a record of bagpipe music.",
        "That was what they were.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll let you have your drink in peace now,\u2019 she said, patting Arthur lightly on his seething shoulder, \u2018but I knew you\u2019d like to see.\u2019 Arthur re engaged his eyes with Fenchurch\u2019s once again, and suddenly was at a loss for something to say.",
        "A moment had come and gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had been wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over the top of her glass, \u2018we will talk again.\u2019 She took a sip.",
        "\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 she added, \u2018it wouldn\u2019t have gone so well if it wasn\u2019t for her.\u2019 She gave a wry smile and dropped her hair forward over her face again.",
        "It was perfectly true.",
        "He had to admit it was perfectly true.",
        "13 That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had won.",
        "It was eight o\u2019clock and he decided he would make himself, force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned her.",
        "Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow.",
        "That would be the cool thing to do.",
        "Or next week sometime.",
        "No games.",
        "He wanted her and didn\u2019t care who knew it.",
        "He definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her, wanted to do more things than there were names for with her.",
        "He actually caught himself saying things like \u2018Yippee\u2019 as he pranced ridiculously round the house.",
        "Her eyes, her hair, her voice, everything...",
        "He stopped.",
        "He would put on the record of bagpipe music.",
        "Then he would call her.",
        "Would he, perhaps, call her first? No.",
        "What he would do was this.",
        "He would put on the record of bagpipe music.",
        "He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of it.",
        "Then he would call her.",
        "That was the correct order.",
        "That was what he would do.",
        "He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he did so.",
        "He picked up the record.",
        "It failed to blow up.",
        "He slipped it out of its cover.",
        "He opened the record player, he turned on the amp.",
        "They both survived.",
        "He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus on to the disc.",
        "He sat and listened solemnly to \u2018A Scottish Soldier\u2019.",
        "He listened to \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019.",
        "He listened to something about some glen or other.",
        "He thought about his miraculous lunchtime.",
        "They had just been on the point of leaving, when they were distracted by an awful outbreak of \u2018yoo hooing\u2019.",
        "The appallingly permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid bird with a broken wing.",
        "Everyone in the pub turned to them and seemed to be expecting some sort of response.",
        "They hadn\u2019t listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie was going to be about the \u00a34.30p everyone had helped to raise towards the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy liqueurs, and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that the yoo hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket number 37.",
        "Arthur discovered that he had.",
        "He glanced angrily at his watch.",
        "Fenchurch gave him a push.",

        "Don\u2019t be bad tempered.",
        "Give them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me a call and tell me how it went.",
        "I\u2019ll want to hear the record.",
        "Go on.\u2019 She flicked his arm and left.",
        "The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over effusive.",
        "It was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music.",
        "Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on breaking into laughter.",
        "14 Ring ring.",
        "Ring ring.",
        "Ring ring.",
        "\u2018Hello, yes? Yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "You\u2019ll \u2019ave to speak up, there\u2019s an awful lot of noise in \u2019ere.",
        "What? \u2018No, I only do the bar in the evenings.",

        "\u2018 \u2019Ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he\u2019s won a raffle.",
        "He keeps on saying it\u2019s ticket 37 and he\u2019s won.\u2019 \u2018No, there was a guy in the pub here won,\u2019 shouted back the barman.",
        "\u2018He says \u2019ave we got the ticket.\u2019 \u2018Well how can he think he\u2019s won if he hasn\u2019t even got a ticket?\u2019 \u2018Jim says \u2019ow can you think you\u2019ve won if you \u2019aven\u2019t even got the ticket.",

        "Says there\u2019s a number on the ticket.\u2019 \u2018Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle ticket, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018 \u2019E says \u2019e means it\u2019s a telephone number on the ticket.\u2019 \u2018Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?\u2019 15 Eight hours west sat a man alone on a beach mourning an inexplicable loss.",
        "He could only think of his loss in little packets of grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great to be borne.",
        "He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand, and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to happen.",
        "As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn\u2019t happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped beneath the long line of the sea, and the day was gone.",
        "The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los Angeles, which is described in the new edition of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as \u2018junky, wunky, lunky, stunky, and what\u2019s that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff, woo\u2019, and in another, written only hours later, as \u2018being like several thousand square miles of American Express junk mail, but without the same sense of moral depth.",
        "Plus the air is, for some reason, yellow.\u2019 The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a \u2018good place to go.",
        "It\u2019s very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is also a space traveller.",
        "Starting a new religion for you is just their way of saying \u201chi\u201d.",
        "Until you\u2019ve settled in and got the hang of the place it is best to say \u201cno\u201d to three questions out of any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some very strange things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting alien could die of.\u2019 The hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets are described in the Guide as \u2018Boffo.",
        "A good one.\u2019 And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being insane.",
        "But this was only, as he would tell people, because he was.",
        "One of the many many reasons why people thought him insane was because of the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land where most people\u2019s houses were peculiar in one way or another, was quite extreme in its peculiarness.",
        "His house was called The Outside of the Asylum.",
        "His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be called \u2013 and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to do this \u2013 Wonko the Sane.",
        "In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it.",
        "We can talk of him much later on \u2013 this is just an interlude to watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it.",
        "He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting for the end of the world \u2013 little realizing that it had already been and gone.",
        "16 After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no telephone number, Arthur tried everything he could to find Fenchurch, and the more things he tried, the more weeks passed.",
        "He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the world and its weather.",
        "He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where he\u2019d been just before he met her.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s the drizzle that makes me particularly morose.\u2019 \u2018Please shut up about the drizzle,\u2019 snapped Arthur.",
        "\u2018I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling.\u2019 \u2018Look...\u2019 \u2018But I\u2019ll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling, shall I?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Blatter.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018It will blatter.\u2019 Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly outside world.",
        "It was a completely pointless place to be, he realized, and he had been driven there by superstition rather than logic.",
        "However, as if to bait him with the knowledge that such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last time.",
        "The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man\u2019s exasperating conversation.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even bothering to say this, \u2018that it\u2019s easing off.\u2019 \u2018Ha!\u2019 Arthur just shrugged.",
        "He should go.",
        "That\u2019s what he should do.",
        "He should just go.",
        "\u2018It never stops raining!\u2019 ranted the lorry driver.",
        "He thumped the table, spilt his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be steaming.",
        "You can\u2019t just walk off without responding to a remark like that.",
        "\u2018Of course it stops raining,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "It was hardly an elegant refutation, but it had to be said.",
        "\u2018It rains...",
        "all...",
        "the time,\u2019 raved the man, thumping the table again, in time to the words.",
        "Arthur shook his head.",
        "\u2018Stupid to say it rains all the time...\u2019 he said.",
        "The man\u2019s eyebrows shot up, affronted.",
        "\u2018Stupid? Why\u2019s it stupid? Why\u2019s it stupid to say it rains all the time if it rains the whole time?\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t rain yesterday.\u2019 \u2018Did in Darlington.\u2019 Arthur paused, warily.",
        "\u2018You going to ask me where I was yesterday?\u2019 asked the man.",
        "\u2018Eh?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur.",

        "How\u2019s it going, Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet weather tyres on? Har har.\u2019 He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to someone at a nearby table.",
        "\u2018See, none of them bastards take me seriously,\u2019 said Rob McKenna.",
        "\u2018But,\u2019 he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes, \u2018they all know it\u2019s true!\u2019 Arthur frowned.",
        "\u2018Like my wife,\u2019 hissed the sole owner and driver of McKenna\u2019s All Weather Haulage.",
        "\u2018She says it\u2019s nonsense and I make a fuss and complain about nothing, but,\u2019 he paused dramatically and darted out dangerous looks from his eyes, \u2018she always brings the washing in when I phone to say I\u2019m on me way home!\u2019 He brandished his coffee spoon.",
        "\u2018What do you make of that?\u2019 \u2018Well...\u2019 \u2018I have a book,\u2019 he went on, \u2018I have a book.",

        "There was no but.",
        "It had been a totally lousy cave and he had hated it.",

        "Arthur Dent was such a person and so he went to Exeter to buy a computer.",
        "That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer.",
        "But he felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he simply went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with.",
        "So that was his serious purpose.",
        "To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on prehistoric Earth.",
        "He explained this to the man in the shop.",
        "\u2018Why?\u2019 said the man in the shop.",
        "This was a tricky one.",
        "\u2018OK, skip that,\u2019 said the man in the shop.",
        "\u2018How?\u2019 \u2018Well, I was hoping you could help me with that.\u2019 The man sighed and his shoulders drooped.",
        "\u2018Have you much experience of computers?\u2019 Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard computer on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a second, or Deep Thought, or \u2013 but decided he wouldn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Looks like a fun afternoon,\u2019 said the man in the shop, but he said it only to himself.",
        "Arthur bought the Apple anyway.",
        "Over a few days he also acquired some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night, and worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which was that the whole project was completely ludicrous.",
        "Rough drawings from memory were futile.",
        "He didn\u2019t even know how long it had been, beyond Ford Prefect\u2019s rough guess at the time that it was \u2018a couple of million years\u2019 and he simply didn\u2019t have the maths.",
        "Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least produce a result.",
        "He decided not to mind the fact that with the extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations and arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result.",
        "He would call it the right result.",
        "Who would know? As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never know that.",
        "He just went up to London and knocked on the appropriate door.",
        "I thought you were going to phone me first.\u2019 Arthur gaped in astonishment.",
        "\u2018You can only come in for a few minutes,\u2019 said Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m just going out.\u2019 18 A summer\u2019s day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of antique restoring machinery.",
        "Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur wandered in a blissed out haze and looked at all the shops which, in Islington, are quite a useful bunch, as anyone who regularly needs old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office furniture or fish will readily confirm.",
        "The sun beat down over the roof gardens.",
        "It beat on architects and plumbers.",
        "It beat on barristers and burglars.",
        "It beat on pizzas.",
        "It beat on estate agents particulars.",
        "It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s an interesting building,\u2019 said the proprietor, cheerfully.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a nearby pub.",
        "It was built for the Prince Regent, apparently, so he could make his escape when he needed to.\u2019 \u2018You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine furniture,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said the proprietor, \u2018not for that reason.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll have to excuse me,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m terribly happy.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of Greenpeace.",
        "He remembered the contents of his file marked \u2018Things to do \u2013 urgent!\u2019, which he hadn\u2019t opened again in the meantime.",
        "He marched in with a cheery smile and said he\u2019d come to give them some money to help free the dolphins.",
        "\u2018Very funny,\u2019 they told him, \u2018go away.\u2019 This wasn\u2019t quite the response he had expected, so he tried again.",
        "This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine.",
        "Just after six he returned to Fenchurch\u2019s house in the alleyway, clutching a bottle of champagne.",
        "\u2018Hold this,\u2019 she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand and disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from which dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar.",
        "The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of Islington.",
        "As well as its large stable doors it also had a normal looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood with a black dolphin door knocker.",
        "The one odd thing about this door was its doorstep, which was nine feet high, since the door was set into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses.",
        "An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and it was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung.",
        "The other end of the rope held a suspended cello.",
        "The door opened above his head.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018pull on the rope, steady the cello.",
        "Pass it up to me.\u2019 He pulled on the rope, he steadied the cello.",
        "\u2018I can\u2019t pull on the rope again,\u2019 he said, \u2018without letting go of the cello.\u2019 Fenchurch leant down.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m steadying the cello,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018You pull on the rope.\u2019 The cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly, and Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside.",
        "\u2018Come on up yourself,\u2019 she called down.",
        "Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the stable doors, tingling.",
        "The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty rough and full of junk.",
        "A large old cast iron mangle stood there, a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner.",
        "There was also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram, but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books.",
        "The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked.",
        "And this was the measure of Arthur\u2019s mood as he started up the rickety wooden steps in the far corner.",
        "Even a cracked concrete floor seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing.",
        "\u2018An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do wonderful things with this place,\u2019 said Fenchurch chattily as Arthur emerged through the floor.",
        "\u2018He keeps on coming round, standing in stunned amazement muttering about space and objects and events and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs a pencil and disappears for weeks.",
        "Wonderful things have, therefore, so far failed to happen to it.\u2019 In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at least reasonably wonderful anyway.",
        "It was simply decorated, furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up Stonehenge.",
        "There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were interesting.",
        "There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which held a bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you could actually swing a cat in.",
        "\u2018But,\u2019 she added, \u2018only if it was a reasonably patient cat and didn\u2019t mind a few nasty cracks about the head.",
        "Here you are.\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 They looked at each other for a moment.",
        "The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was coming from.",
        "For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel selfconscious if left alone for long enough with a Swiss cheese plant, the moment was one of sustained revelation.",
        "He felt on the sudden like a cramped and zoo born animal who awakes one morning to find the door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching grey and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new sounds are waking.",
        "He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise.",
        "He hadn\u2019t realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones till it now said something it had never said to him before, which was \u2018Yes\u2019.",
        "Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her head.",
        "\u2018I know,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018I shall have to remember,\u2019 she added, \u2018that you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it.\u2019 She turned away.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s go for a walk,\u2019 she said quickly.",
        "\u2018Hyde Park.",
        "I\u2019ll change into something less suitable.\u2019 She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly shapely one, and it didn\u2019t really suit her.",
        "\u2018I wear it specially for my cello teacher,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s a nice old boy, but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit excited.",
        "I\u2019ll be down in a moment.\u2019 She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called down, \u2018Put the bottle in the fridge for later.\u2019 He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that it had an identical twin to sit next to.",
        "He walked over to the window and looked out.",
        "He turned and started to look at her records.",
        "From above he heard the rustle of her dress fall to the ground.",
        "He talked to himself about the sort of person he was.",
        "He told himself very firmly that for this moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records, read the titles, nod appreciatively, count the blasted things if he had to.",
        "He would keep his head down.",
        "This he completely, utterly and abjectly failed to do.",
        "She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed hardly to notice that he was looking up at her.",
        "Then suddenly she shook her head, dropped the light sundress down over herself and disappeared quickly into the bathroom.",
        "She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and came tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness.",
        "It was a strange kind of dancing motion she had.",
        "She saw that he noticed it and put her head slightly on one side.",
        "\u2018Like it?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018You look gorgeous,\u2019 he said simply, because she did.",
        "\u2018Hmmmm,\u2019 she said, as if he hadn\u2019t really answered her question.",
        "She closed the upstairs front door, which had stood open all this time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in a fit state to be left on its own for a while.",
        "Arthur\u2019s eyes followed hers around, and while he was looking in the other direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the canvas bag she was carrying.",
        "Arthur looked back at her.",
        "\u2018Ready?\u2019 \u2018Did you know,\u2019 she said with a slightly puzzled smile, \u2018that there\u2019s something wrong with me?\u2019 Her directness caught Arthur unprepared.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019d heard some vague sort of...\u2019 \u2018I wonder how much you do know about me,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018If you heard from where I think you heard then that\u2019s not it.",
        "Russell just sort of makes stuff up, because he can\u2019t deal with what it really is.\u2019 A pang of worry went through Arthur.",
        "\u2018Then what is it?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Can you tell me?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 she said, \u2018it\u2019s nothing bad at all.",
        "Just unusual.",
        "Very very unusual.\u2019 She touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him briefly.",
        "\u2018I shall be very interested to know,\u2019 she said, \u2018if you manage to work out what it is this evening.\u2019 Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would have chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail.",
        "19 Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire.",
        "He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the noisier machinery in its vicinity and padding it with towels.",
        "He slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily.",
        "They were claustrophobic and ill lit, and what light there was was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way and that through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping humming noises.",
        "That wasn\u2019t it, though.",
        "He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty searing screech.",
        "That wasn\u2019t it either.",
        "He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor, though still ill lit.",
        "The ship lurched.",
        "It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was heavier.",
        "A small platoon of robots went by making a terrible clattering.",
        "Still not it, though.",
        "Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he walked along it in the other direction.",
        "He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched Perspex.",
        "One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system.",
        "It was hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly felt very strongly about it.",
        "Ford turned the sound down.",
        "That wasn\u2019t it, though.",
        "He passed another monitor.",
        "It was showing a commercial for some brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if you used it.",
        "There was nasty blaring music with it too, but that wasn\u2019t it.",
        "He came upon another, much larger three dimensional screen that was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship.",
        "As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon, silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star Xaxis, and the ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them.",
        "That was it.",
        "Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes.",
        "He slumped on the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on.",
        "He yawned and dug his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy out of his satchel.",
        "He activated the screen, and flicked idly through some level three entries and some level four entries.",
        "He was looking for some good insomnia cures.",
        "He found REST, which was what he reckoned he needed.",
        "He found REST AND RECUPERATION and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a better idea.",
        "He looked up at the monitor screen.",
        "The battle was raging more fiercely every second and the noise was appalling.",
        "The ship juddered, screamed, and lurched as each new bolt of stunning energy was delivered or received.",
        "He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few likely locations.",
        "He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his satchel again.",
        "He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff and biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of the Guide.",
        "When all the information that he could think was relevant had been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it lightly in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his satchel, smirked, and went in search of the ship\u2019s computer data banks.",
        "20 \u2018The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the summer, especially in parks,\u2019 said the voice earnestly, \u2018is to make girls\u2019 breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye.",
        "I am convinced that this is the case.\u2019 Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they passed.",
        "She hugged him more tightly for a moment.",
        "\u2018And I am certain,\u2019 said the frizzy ginger haired youth with the long thin nose who was expostulating from his deckchair by the side of the Serpentine, \u2018that if one worked the argument through, one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic from everything,\u2019 he insisted to his thin dark haired companion who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about his spots, \u2018that Darwin was going on about.",
        "This is certain.",
        "This is indisputable.",
        "And,\u2019 he added, \u2018I love it.\u2019 He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at Fenchurch.",
        "Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently quaking.",
        "\u2018Next guess,\u2019 she said, when she had stopped giggling, \u2018come on.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 he said, \u2018your elbow.",
        "Your left elbow.",
        "There\u2019s something wrong with your left elbow.\u2019 \u2018Wrong again,\u2019 she said, \u2018completely wrong.",
        "You\u2019re on completely the wrong track.\u2019 The summer sun was sinking through the trees in the park, looking as if\u2014Let\u2019s not mince words.",
        "Hyde Park is stunning.",
        "Everything about it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings.",
        "Even the ducks are stunning.",
        "Anyone who can go through Hyde Park on a summer\u2019s evening and not feel moved by it is probably going through in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face.",
        "It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than they do elsewhere.",
        "Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree.",
        "The piper paused to chase off an American couple who had tried, timidly, to put some coins on the box his bagpipes came in.",
        "\u2018No!\u2019 he shouted at them.",
        "\u2018Go away! I\u2019m only practising.\u2019 He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise this made could not disfigure their mood.",
        "Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t think it can be your bottom,\u2019 he said after a while, \u2018there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with that at all.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 she agreed, \u2018there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with my bottom.\u2019 They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and practised on the other side of the tree.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll tell you a story,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Good.\u2019 They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which ran beneath the stunning ducks.",
        "\u2018A story,\u2019 said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her.",
        "\u2018Which will tell something of the sort of things that happen to me.",
        "It\u2019s absolutely true.",
        "\u2018You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to be something that happened to their wife\u2019s cousin\u2019s best friend, but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line.",
        "\u2018Well, it\u2019s like one of those stories, except that it actually happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it actually happened to was me.\u2019 \u2018Like the raffle ticket.\u2019 Arthur laughed.",
        "\u2018Yes.",
        "I had a train to catch,\u2019 he went on.",
        "\u2018I arrived at the station\u2014\u2019 \u2018Did I ever tell you,\u2019 interrupted Fenchurch, \u2018what happened to my parents in a station?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you did.\u2019 \u2018Just checking.\u2019 Arthur glanced at his watch.",
        "\u2018I suppose we could think of getting back,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Tell me the story,\u2019 said Fenchurch firmly.",
        "\u2018You arrived at the station.\u2019 \u2018I was about twenty minutes early.",
        "I\u2019d got the time of the train wrong.",
        "I suppose it is at least equally possible,\u2019 he added after a moment\u2019s reflection, \u2018that British Rail had got the time of the train wrong.",
        "Hadn\u2019t occurred to me before.\u2019 \u2018Get on with it.\u2019 Fenchurch laughed.",
        "\u2018So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the buffet to get a cup of coffee.\u2019 \u2018You do the crossword?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Which one?\u2019 \u2018The Guardian usually.\u2019 \u2018I think it tries to be too cute.",
        "I prefer The Times.",
        "Did you solve it?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018The crossword in the Guardian.\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t had a chance to look at it yet,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019m still trying to buy the coffee.\u2019 \u2018All right, then.",
        "Buy the coffee.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m buying it.",
        "I am also,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018buying some biscuits.\u2019 \u2018What sort?\u2019 \u2018Rich Tea.\u2019 \u2018Good choice.\u2019 \u2018I like them.",
        "Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit at a table.",
        "And don\u2019t ask me what the table was like because this was some time ago and I can\u2019t remember.",
        "It was probably round.\u2019 \u2018All right.\u2019 \u2018So let me give you the layout.",
        "Me sitting at the table.",

        "On my right, the cup of coffee.",
        "In the middle of the table, the packet of biscuits.\u2019 \u2018I see it perfectly.\u2019 \u2018What you don\u2019t see,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018because I haven\u2019t mentioned him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already.",
        "He is sitting there opposite me.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s he like?\u2019 \u2018Perfectly ordinary.",
        "Briefcase.",
        "Business suit.",

        "I know the type.",
        "What did he do?\u2019 \u2018He did this.",
        "He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Ate it.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018He ate it.\u2019 Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment.",
        "\u2018What on earth did you do?\u2019 \u2018Well, in the circumstances I did what any red blooded Englishman would do.",
        "I was compelled,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018to ignore it.\u2019 \u2018What? Why?\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s not the sort of thing you\u2019re trained for, is it? I searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits.\u2019 \u2018Well, you could...\u2019 Fenchurch thought about it.",
        "\u2018I must say I\u2019m not sure what I would have done either.",
        "So what happened?\u2019 \u2018I stared furiously at the crossword,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Couldn\u2019t do a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so there was nothing for it.",
        "I braced myself.",
        "I took a biscuit, trying very hard not to notice,\u2019 he added, \u2018that the packet was already mysteriously open...\u2019 \u2018But you\u2019re fighting back, taking a tough line.\u2019 \u2018After my fashion, yes.",
        "I ate the biscuit.",
        "I ate it very deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to what it was I was doing.",
        "When I eat a biscuit,\u2019 Arthur said, \u2018it stays eaten.\u2019 \u2018So what did he do?\u2019 \u2018Took another one.",
        "Honestly,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018this is exactly what happened.",
        "He took another biscuit, he ate it.",
        "Clear as daylight.",
        "Certain as we are sitting on the ground.\u2019 Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably.",
        "\u2018And the problem was,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that having not said anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to broach the subject the second time around.",
        "What do you say? \u201cExcuse me...",
        "I couldn\u2019t help noticing, er...\u201d Doesn\u2019t work.",
        "No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigour than previously.\u2019 \u2018My man...\u2019 \u2018Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn\u2019t budge a bit of it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St Crispin\u2019s Day...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I went into the breach again.",
        "I took,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018another biscuit.",
        "And for an instant our eyes met.\u2019 \u2018Like this?\u2019 \u2018Yes, well, no, not quite like that.",
        "But they met.",
        "Just for an instant.",
        "And we both looked away.",
        "But I am here to tell you,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that there was a little electricity in the air.",
        "There was a little tension building up over the table.",
        "At about this time.\u2019 \u2018I can imagine.\u2019 \u2018We went through the whole packet like this.",
        "Him, me, him, me...\u2019 \u2018The whole packet?\u2019 \u2018Well, it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of biscuits we were getting through at this point.",
        "Gladiators could hardly have had a tougher time.\u2019 \u2018Gladiators,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018would have had to do it in the sun.",
        "More physically gruelling.\u2019 \u2018There is that.",
        "When the empty packet was lying dead between us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left.",
        "I heaved a sigh of relief, of course.",
        "As it happened, my train was announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper...\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Were my biscuits.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 \u2018True.\u2019 \u2018No!\u2019 She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing.",
        "She sat up again.",
        "\u2018You complete nitwit,\u2019 she hooted, \u2018you almost completely and utterly foolish person.\u2019 She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled off again.",
        "He was surprised at how light she was.",
        "\u2018Now you tell me a story.\u2019 \u2018I thought,\u2019 she said putting on a low husky voice, \u2018that you were very keen to get back.\u2019 \u2018No hurry,\u2019 he said airily, \u2018I want you to tell me a story.\u2019 She looked out over the lake and pondered.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 she said, \u2018it\u2019s only a short one.",
        "And not funny like yours, but...",
        "Anyway.\u2019 She looked down.",
        "Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts of moments.",
        "The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting.",
        "Arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own business.",

        "This is the bit where the girl suddenly says, \u201cWhen I was a kid\u201d and starts to unburden herself.",
        "We have got to that bit.",
        "When I was a kid I had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed...",
        "What do you think of it so far?\u2019 \u2018I like it.",
        "I think it\u2019s moving well.",
        "You\u2019re getting the bedroom interest in nice and early.",
        "We could probably do with some development with the picture.\u2019 \u2018It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to like,\u2019 she said, \u2018but don\u2019t.",
        "Full of endearing little animals doing endearing things, you know?\u2019 \u2018I know.",
        "I was plagued with them too.",
        "Rabbits in waistcoats.\u2019 \u2018Exactly.",
        "These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted rats and owls.",
        "There may even have been a reindeer.\u2019 \u2018On the raft.\u2019 \u2018On the raft.",
        "And a boy was sitting on the raft.\u2019 \u2018Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer.\u2019 \u2018Precisely there.",
        "A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety.\u2019 \u2018Ugh.\u2019 \u2018The picture worried me, I must say.",
        "There was an otter swimming in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying about this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched animals on it who shouldn\u2019t even be on a raft, and the otter had such a thin tail to pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling it all the time.",
        "Worried me.",
        "Not badly, but just vaguely, all the time.",
        "\u2018Then one day \u2013 and remember I\u2019d been looking at this picture every night for years \u2013 I suddenly noticed that the raft had a sail.",
        "Never seen it before.",
        "The otter was fine, he was just swimming along.\u2019 She shrugged.",
        "\u2018Good story?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Ends weakly,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018leaves the audience crying \u201cYes, but what of it?\u201d Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before the credits.\u2019 Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs.",
        "\u2018It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like black and white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being watered.",
        "The sudden shift of perspective that says, \u201cPut away your worries, the world is a good and perfect place.",

        "\u2018Well, it\u2019s all right,\u2019 she said, \u2018I did.",
        "That\u2019s exactly what I felt.",
        "But you see, I\u2019ve felt that before, even stronger.",
        "Incredibly strongly.",
        "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a bit of a one,\u2019 she said, gazing off into the distance, \u2018for sudden startling revelations.\u2019 Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser, therefore, for the moment not to try.",
        "\u2018It was very odd,\u2019 she said, much as one of the pursuing Egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side.",
        "\u2018Very odd,\u2019 she repeated, \u2018for days before, the strangest feeling had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth.",
        "No, it wasn\u2019t like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected into something, bit by bit.",
        "No, not even that; it was as if the whole of the Earth, through me, was going to...\u2019 \u2018Does the number,\u2019 said Arthur gently, \u2018forty two mean anything to you at all?\u2019 \u2018What? No, what are you talking about?\u2019 exclaimed Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018Just a thought,\u2019 murmured Arthur.",
        "\u2018Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious.\u2019 \u2018I was being perfectly serious,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s just the Universe I\u2019m never quite sure about.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 \u2018Tell me the rest of it,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t worry if it sounds odd.",
        "Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of stuff,\u2019 he added, \u2018that is odd.",
        "And I don\u2019t mean biscuits.\u2019 She nodded, and seemed to believe him.",
        "Suddenly, she gripped his arm.",
        "\u2018It was so simple,\u2019 she said, \u2018so wonderfully and extraordinarily simple, when it came.\u2019 \u2018What was it?\u2019 said Arthur quietly.",
        "\u2018Arthur, you see,\u2019 she said, \u2018that\u2019s what I no longer know.",
        "And the loss is unbearable.",
        "If I try to think back to it, it all goes flickery and jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the teacup and I just black out.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Well, like your story,\u2019 she said, \u2018the best bit happened in a caf\u00e9.",
        "I was sitting there, having a cup of tea.",
        "This was after days of this build up, the feeling of becoming connected up.",
        "I think I was buzzing gently.",
        "And there was some work going on at a building site opposite the caf\u00e9, and I was watching it through the window, over the rim of my teacup, which I always find is the nicest way of watching other people working.",
        "And suddenly, there it was in my mind, this message from somewhere.",
        "And it was so simple.",
        "It made such sense of everything.",
        "I just sat up and thought, \u201cOh! Oh, well that\u2019s all right, then.\u201d I was so startled I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it.",
        "Yes,\u2019 she added thoughtfully, \u2018I\u2019m sure I did.",
        "How much sense am I making?\u2019 \u2018It was fine up to the bit about the teacup.\u2019 She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it, which is what she was trying to do.",
        "\u2018Well, that\u2019s it,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Fine up to the bit about the teacup.",
        "That was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if the world exploded.\u2019 \u2018What...?\u2019 \u2018I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was hallucinations, but if that was hallucinations then I have hallucinations in big screen 3D with 16 track Dolby Stereo and should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with shark movies.",
        "It was as if the ground was literally ripped from under my feet, and...",
        "and...\u2019 She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say.",
        "\u2018And I woke up in hospital.",
        "I suppose I\u2019ve been in and out ever since.",
        "And that\u2019s why I have an instinctive nervousness,\u2019 she said, \u2018of sudden startling revelations that everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u2019 She looked up at him.",
        "Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had consigned them to that part of his mind marked \u2018Things to think about \u2013 Urgent.\u2019 \u2018Here is the world,\u2019 he had told himself.",
        "\u2018Here, for whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays.",
        "With me on it.\u2019 But now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that night in the car when Fenchurch\u2019s brother had told him the silly stories of the CIA agent in the reservoir.",
        "The French Embassy went swimmy.",
        "The trees went swimmy.",
        "The lake went swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on it.",
        "The geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major answers they wished to know the questions to.",
        "\u2018Anyway,\u2019 said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide eyed smile, \u2018there is something wrong with part of me, and you\u2019ve got to find out what it is.",
        "We\u2019ll go home.\u2019 Arthur shook his head.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 she said.",
        "Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world\u2019s great suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he was least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from behind a door and go boo at him.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you say you felt as if the Earth actually...",
        "exploded...\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "More than felt.\u2019 \u2018Which is what everybody else says,\u2019 he said hesitantly, \u2018is hallucinations?\u2019 \u2018Yes, but Arthur, that\u2019s ridiculous.",
        "People think that if you just say \u201challucinations\u201d it explains anything you want it to explain and eventually whatever it is you can\u2019t understand will just go away.",
        "It\u2019s just a word, it doesn\u2019t explain anything.",
        "It doesn\u2019t explain why the dolphins disappeared.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he added thoughtfully.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he added again, even more thoughtfully.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 he said at last.",
        "\u2018Doesn\u2019t explain the dolphins disappearing.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I see that.",
        "Which dolphins do you mean?\u2019 \u2018What do you mean which dolphins? I\u2019m talking about when all the dolphins disappeared.\u2019 She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking his back, and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he so often got when people were trying to explain things to him.",
        "\u2018The dolphins?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018All the dolphins,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018disappeared?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018The dolphins? You\u2019re saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is this,\u2019 said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point, \u2018what you\u2019re saying?\u2019 \u2018Arthur, where have you been, for Heaven\u2019s sake? The dolphins all disappeared on the same day I...\u2019 She stared him intently in his startled eyes.",
        "\u2018What...?\u2019 \u2018No dolphins.",

        "\u2018No one knows.",
        "That\u2019s what vanished means.\u2019 She paused.",
        "\u2018Well, there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he lives in California,\u2019 she said, \u2018and is mad.",
        "I was thinking of going to see him because it seems the only lead I\u2019ve got on what happened to me.\u2019 She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly.",

        "\u2018I really would like to know where you\u2019ve been,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018I think something terrible happened to you then as well.",
        "And that\u2019s why we recognized each other.\u2019 She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into the clutches of dusk.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 she said, \u2018now you\u2019ve got someone you can tell.\u2019 Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh.",
        "\u2018It is,\u2019 he said, \u2018a very long story.\u2019 Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag.",
        "\u2018Is it anything to do with this?\u2019 she said.",
        "The thing she took out of her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled into prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly on the deserts of Kakrafoon, half buried in the marbled sands that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on the glaciers of the moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that might happen to it, they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy plastic cover and written on it, in large friendly letters, the words DON\u2019T PANIC.",
        "\u2018Where did you get this?\u2019 said Arthur, startled, taking it from her.",
        "\u2018Ah,\u2019 she said, \u2018I thought it was yours.",
        "In Russell\u2019s car that night.",
        "You dropped it.",
        "Have you been to many of these places?\u2019 Arthur drew The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy from its cover.",
        "It was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer.",
        "He tapped some buttons till the screen flared with text.",
        "\u2018A few,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Can we go to them?\u2019 \u2018What? No,\u2019 said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented warily.",
        "\u2018Do you want to?\u2019 he said, hoping for the answer no.",
        "It was an act of great generosity on his part not to say, \u2018You don\u2019t want to, do you?\u2019 which expects it.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018I want to know what the message was that I lost, and where it came from.",
        "Because I don\u2019t think,\u2019 she added, standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park, \u2018that it came from here.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not even sure,\u2019 she further added, slipping her arm around Arthur\u2019s waist, \u2018that I know where here is.\u2019 21 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing.",
        "It is, essentially, as the title implies, a guide book.",
        "The problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable proportion of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this.",

        "The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place.",
        "There is, frankly, so much of it, every bit of which is continually on the move, continually changing.",
        "A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently striving to keep this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of all the changing circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy throws up every minute of every hour of every day, and you would be wrong.",
        "Where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize that the editor, like all the editors the Guide has ever had, has no real grasp of the meanings of the words \u2018scrupulous\u2019, \u2018conscientious\u2019 or \u2018diligent\u2019, and tends to get his nightmares through a straw.",
        "Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub Etha Net according to if they read good.",

        "In Ancient days, before the Advent of the Sorth of Bragadox, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but everyone somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how on earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone\u2019s guess, virgins, it was not possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars without hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis Fire Dragons.",
        "Whether you would want to do that is another matter.",
        "Not that Fire Dragons weren\u2019t an essentially peace loving species, because they were.",
        "They adored it to bits, and this wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the problem: one so often hurts the one one loves, especially if one is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like a rocket booster and teeth like a park fence.",
        "Another problem was that once they were in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones that other people loved as well.",
        "Add to all that the relatively small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons.",
        "But did they mind? They did not.",
        "Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No.",
        "The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars for their savage beauty, their noble ways and their habit of biting people who didn\u2019t revere them.",
        "Why was this? The answer was simple.",
        "There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost unbearably sexy about having huge fire breathing magical dragons flying low about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on the sweet and fragrant side.",
        "Why this should be so, the romance besotted people of Brequinda in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and going, for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk winged leather bodied Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the evening horizon than half the people of Brequinda were scurrying off into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn all smiling and happy and still claiming, rather endearingly, to be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins.",
        "Pheromones, some researchers said.",
        "Something sonic, others claimed.",
        "The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it.",
        "Not surprisingly, the Guide\u2019s graphically enticing description of the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be astonishingly popular amongst hitchhikers who allow themselves to be guided by it, and so it has simply never been taken out, and it is therefore left to latter day travellers to find out for themselves that today\u2019s modern Brequinda in the City State of Avalars is now little more than concrete, strip joints and Dragon Burger Bars.",
        "22 The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant.",
        "There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the alley, but if any had chanced by they might just as well have sloped off across the road for a pizza, for they were not going to be needed.",
        "Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle of their American Hots with extra anchovy they could always have sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is now known to have much the same effect.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018not yet.\u2019 Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo.",
        "Fenchurch pushed ajar the upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant night air.",
        "They both sat on some of the furniture made out of cushions, very close to the open bottle of champagne.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018not till you\u2019ve found out what\u2019s wrong with me, which bit.",
        "But I suppose,\u2019 she added, very, very, very quietly, \u2018that we may as well start with where your hand is now.\u2019 Arthur said, \u2018So which way do I go?\u2019 \u2018Down,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018on this occasion.\u2019 He moved his hand.",
        "\u2018Down,\u2019 she said, \u2018is in fact the other way.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes.\u2019 Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff beer \u2013 which is not strictly relevant at this point since the record hadn\u2019t yet got to that bit, but there will be too much else going on when it does, and furthermore the chronicler does not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch, so it seems best to mention it now while things are still moving slowly.",
        "\u2018And so we come,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018to your knee.",
        "There is something terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee.\u2019 \u2018My left knee,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018is absolutely fine.\u2019 \u2018So it is.\u2019 \u2018Did you know that...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Ahm, it\u2019s all right, I can tell you do.",
        "No, keep going.\u2019 \u2018So it has to be something to do with your feet...\u2019 She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders noncommittally against the cushions.",
        "Since there are cushions in the Universe, on Squornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in from the swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being wriggled against, particularly if it\u2019s noncommittally because of the syncopated way in which the shoulders move, it\u2019s a pity they weren\u2019t there.",
        "They weren\u2019t, but such is life.",
        "Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over carefully.",
        "All kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away from her legs was making it difficult for him to think particularly clearly at this point.",
        "\u2018I have to admit,\u2019 he said, \u2018that I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll know when you find it,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Really you will.\u2019 There was a slight catch in her voice.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s not that one.\u2019 Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on to the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her right foot.",
        "She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him, because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the record, you would know made it impossible not to do this.",
        "Then she gave him her right foot.",
        "He stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes, along her instep, could find nothing wrong with it.",
        "She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her head.",
        "\u2018No, don\u2019t stop,\u2019 she said, \u2018but it\u2019s not that one now.\u2019 Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t stop.\u2019 He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle, under her toes, along her instep and said, \u2018You mean it\u2019s something to do with which leg I\u2019m holding...?\u2019 She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy into the life of a simple cushion from Squornshellous Beta.",
        "He frowned.",
        "\u2018Pick me up,\u2019 she said quietly.",
        "He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up.",
        "So did she.",
        "He picked her up in his arms and they kissed again.",
        "This went on for a while, then she said, \u2018Now put me down again.\u2019 Still puzzled, he did so.",
        "\u2018Well?\u2019 She looked at him almost challengingly.",
        "\u2018So what\u2019s wrong with my feet?\u2019 she said.",
        "Arthur still did not understand.",
        "He sat on the floor, then got down on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it were, in their normal habitat.",
        "And as he looked closely, something odd struck him.",
        "He put his head right down to the ground and peered.",
        "There was a long pause.",
        "He sat back heavily.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I see what\u2019s wrong with your feet.",
        "They don\u2019t touch the ground.\u2019 \u2018So...",
        "so what do you think...?\u2019 Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension making her eyes suddenly dark.",
        "She bit her lip and was trembling.",
        "\u2018What do...\u2019 she stammered.",
        "\u2018Are you...?\u2019 She shook the hair forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears.",
        "He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a single kiss.",
        "\u2018Perhaps you can do what I can do,\u2019 he said, and walked straight out of her upstairs front door.",
        "The record got to the good bit.",
        "23 The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis.",
        "Hundreds of the fierce and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver Xaxisian ship was able to deploy.",
        "Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same blazing forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed through it.",
        "The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left the field of battle.",
        "All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the ship was gone.",
        "With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast tracts of irrationally shaped space quickly, effortlessly, and above all, quietly.",
        "Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old haunts.",
        "He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York.",
        "In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side, beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding welfare and voting rights.",
        "One of these now floated past, waving.",
        "Ford waved back.",
        "The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank.",
        "\u2018Hi,\u2019 it said, \u2018I\u2019ve just been created.",
        "I\u2019m completely new to the Universe in all respects.",
        "Is there anything you can tell me?\u2019 \u2018Phew,\u2019 said Ford, a little nonplussed, \u2018I can tell you where some bars are, I guess.\u2019 \u2018What about love and happiness.",
        "I sense deep needs for things like that,\u2019 it said, waving its tentacles.",
        "\u2018Got any leads there?\u2019 \u2018You can get something like what you require,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018on Seventh Avenue.\u2019 \u2018I instinctively feel,\u2019 said the creature, urgently, \u2018that I need to be beautiful.",
        "Am I?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re pretty direct, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018No point in mucking about.",
        "Am I?\u2019 The thing was oozing all over the place now, squelching and blubbering.",
        "A nearby wino was getting interested.",
        "\u2018To me?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "But listen,\u2019 he added after a moment, \u2018most people make out, you know.",
        "Are there any like you down there?\u2019 \u2018Search me, buster,\u2019 said the creature, \u2018as I said, I\u2019m new here.",
        "Life is entirely strange to me.",
        "What\u2019s it like?\u2019 Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with authority.",
        "\u2018Life,\u2019 he said, \u2018is like a grapefruit.\u2019 \u2018Er, how so?\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s sort of orangey yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy in the middle.",
        "It\u2019s got pips inside too.",
        "Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast.\u2019 \u2018Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?\u2019 \u2018I expect so,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Ask a policeman.\u2019 Deep in his bunk, Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his other side.",
        "It wasn\u2019t his favourite type of dream because it didn\u2019t have Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple Breasted Whore of Eroticon Six, in it, whom many of his dreams did feature.",
        "But at least it was a dream.",
        "At least he was asleep.",
        "24 Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur hadn\u2019t done this sort of thing for a while, at least, not deliberately, and deliberately is exactly the way you are not meant to do it.",
        "He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground and didn\u2019t.",
        "A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it.",
        "The ground was hanging menacingly above his head.",
        "He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him.",
        "He tried to think nice thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right thing to do because he couldn\u2019t at that moment remember precisely what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if that was wildebeests, so it was a tricky kind of thing to think nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of general well disposedness towards things, and all this kept his mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact that it wasn\u2019t touching anything.",
        "A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway.",
        "After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the ground.",
        "\u2018Arthur...\u2019 The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as fall away from it, which is what he did.",
        "Slowly.",
        "Very very slowly.",
        "As he fell slowly, very very slowly, he closed his eyes \u2013 carefully, so as not to jolt anything.",
        "The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body.",
        "Once it had reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the fact that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he slowly, very very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind the other.",
        "That should sort the ground out.",
        "He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly, very very slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened his eyes.",
        "He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until all the birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different.",
        "Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number of things, being in the air.",
        "Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street.",
        "Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the evening was beginning to draw in.",
        "He was, therefore, safely shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity.",
        "He slowly, very very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who was standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her upstairs doorway.",
        "Her face was inches from his.",
        "\u2018I was about to ask you,\u2019 she said in a low trembly voice, \u2018what you were doing.",
        "But then I realized that I could see what you were doing.",
        "You were flying.",
        "So it seemed,\u2019 she went on after a slight wondering pause, \u2018like a bit of a silly question.\u2019 Arthur said, \u2018Can you do it?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Would you like to try?\u2019 She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but just in sheer bewilderment.",
        "She was shaking like a leaf.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s quite easy,\u2019 urged Arthur, \u2018if you don\u2019t know how.",
        "That\u2019s the important bit.",
        "Be not at all sure how you\u2019re doing it.\u2019 Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the alley, fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to her like a banknote on a breath of wind.",
        "\u2018Ask me how I did that.\u2019 \u2018How...",
        "did you do that?\u2019 \u2018No idea.",
        "Not a clue.\u2019 She shrugged in bewilderment.",
        "\u2018So how can I...?\u2019 Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand.",
        "\u2018I want you to try,\u2019 he said, \u2018to step on to my hand.",
        "Just one foot.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Try it.\u2019 Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was trying to step on to the hand of someone who was floating in front of her in midair, she stepped on to his hand.",
        "\u2018Now the other.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Take the weight off your back foot.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Try it.\u2019 \u2018Like this?\u2019 \u2018Like that.\u2019 Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if\u2014She stopped telling herself what what she was doing was like because she had a feeling she didn\u2019t altogether want to know.",
        "She fixed her eyes very very firmly on the guttering of the roof of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether she ought to say something to somebody, and didn\u2019t think for a moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of someone who wasn\u2019t standing on anything at all.",
        "\u2018Now,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018take your weight off your left foot.\u2019 She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company who had their offices round the corner, and took her weight off her left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the gutter.",
        "\u2018Now,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018take the weight off your right foot.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Try.\u2019 She hadn\u2019t seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and it looked to her now as if, as well as the mud and gunge up there, there might also be a bird\u2019s nest.",
        "If she leaned forward just a little and took her weight off her right foot, she could probably see it more clearly.",
        "Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was trying to steal her bicycle.",
        "He particularly didn\u2019t want to get involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy would do it quietly and not look up.",
        "He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole bicycles in alleys and habitually didn\u2019t expect to find their owners hovering several feet above them.",
        "He was relaxed by both these habits, and went about his job with purpose and concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in concrete, he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way.",
        "Arthur let out a long held breath.",
        "\u2018See what a piece of eggshell I have found you,\u2019 said Fenchurch in his ear.",
        "25 Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may have received an impression of his character and habits which, while it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the truth, falls somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole truth in all its glorious aspects.",
        "And the reasons for this are obvious.",
        "Editing, selection, the need to balance that which is interesting with that which is relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance.",
        "Like this, for instance.",
        "\u2018Arthur Dent went to bed.",
        "He went up the stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room, took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes one by one and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor.",
        "He put on his pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe.",
        "He washed his face and hands, cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory, realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order, had to wash his hands again and went to bed.",
        "He read for fifteen minutes, spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work out where in the book he had got to the previous night, then he turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep.",
        "\u2018It was dark.",
        "He lay on his left side for a good hour.",
        "\u2018After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and then turned over to sleep on his right side.",
        "Another hour after this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his nose, though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before he turned back on to his left side.",
        "And so he whiled the night away, sleeping.",
        "\u2018At four he got up and went to the lavatory again.",
        "He opened the door to the lavatory...\u2019 and so on.",
        "It\u2019s guff.",
        "It doesn\u2019t advance the action.",
        "It makes for nice fat books such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn\u2019t actually get you anywhere.",
        "You don\u2019t, in short, want to know.",
        "But there are other omissions as well, beside the teeth cleaning and trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these people have often seemed inordinately interested.",
        "What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings with Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere? To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business.",
        "And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet Krikkit? Just because the planet didn\u2019t have Fuolornis Fire Dragons or Dire Straits doesn\u2019t mean that everyone just sat up every night reading.",
        "Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after the committee meeting party on Prehistoric Earth, when Arthur found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl called Mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising agency on the planet Golgafrincham? What then? What happened next? And the answer is, of course, that the book ended.",
        "The next one didn\u2019t resume the story till five years later, and you can, claim some, take discretion too far.",
        "\u2018This Arthur Dent,\u2019 comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the Galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate, \u2018what is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? Has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?\u2019 Those who wish to know should read on.",
        "Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.",
        "26 Arthur Dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think, as they drifted up, that he very much hoped that his friends who had always found him pleasant but dull, or more latterly, odd but dull, were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last time, for a while, that he thought of them.",
        "They drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except going the other way.",
        "And as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do.",
        "Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated on keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out towards the Westway flyover, on keeping the street lights lit and on making sure that when somebody on Baker Street dropped a cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground.",
        "Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of lights of London \u2013 London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the strangely coloured fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the galaxy, lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky above them, but London \u2013 swayed, swaying and turning, turned.",
        "\u2018Try a swoop,\u2019 he called to Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast empty air.",
        "It was breathy and faint with disbelief \u2013 all those things, clear, faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re flying...\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018A trifle,\u2019 called Arthur, \u2018think nothing of it.",
        "Try a swoop.\u2019 \u2018A sw\u2014\u2019 Her hand caught his, and in a second her weight caught it too, and stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing wildly at nothing.",
        "Physics glanced at Arthur, and clotted with horror he was gone too, sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but his voice.",
        "They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn\u2019t do this sort of thing here.",
        "He couldn\u2019t catch her because this was London, and not a million miles from here, seven hundred and fiftysix, to be exact, in Pisa, Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies fall at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of their relative weights.",
        "They fell.",
        "Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the Italians had to say about physics when they couldn\u2019t even keep a simple tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and damn well did fall faster than Fenchurch.",
        "He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her shoulders.",
        "He got it.",
        "Fine.",
        "They were now falling together, which was all very sweet and romantic, but didn\u2019t solve the basic problem, which was that they were falling, and the ground wasn\u2019t waiting around to see if he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to meet them like an express train.",
        "He couldn\u2019t support her weight, he hadn\u2019t anything he could support it with or against.",
        "The only thing he could think was that they were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do something other than the obvious.",
        "Here he felt he was on familiar territory.",
        "He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face to him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with his little finger and swung her back upwards, tumbling clumsily up after her.",
        "\u2018Shit,\u2019 she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on up into the night.",
        "Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had impossibly come.",
        "The ground was something not to regard with any too firm or steady an eye, but merely to glance at, as it were, in passing.",
        "Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if she judged herself just right against a body of wind she could pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette at the end, followed by a little drop which made her dress billow around her, and this is where readers who are keen to know what Marvin and Ford Prefect have been up to all this while should look ahead to later chapters, because Arthur now could wait no longer and helped her take it off.",
        "It drifted down and away, whipped by the wind until it was a speck which finally vanished, and for various complicated reasons revolutionized the life of a family in Hounslow, over whose washing line it was discovered draped in the morning.",
        "In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the little scratchy Perspex window while somebody else\u2019s son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt.",
        "Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin, wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin.",
        "They felt, even Fenchurch, now protected from the elements by only a couple of fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going to let the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle.",
        "The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch rose now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very very slowly, which is the only way it\u2019s possible to do it when you\u2019re flying and also not using your hands, went on to create considerable havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from top to bottom, Isleworth and Richmond.",
        "They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked very high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it, Fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising tidepool, they found that above the clouds is where the night gets seriously moonlit.",
        "The light is darkly brilliant.",
        "There are different mountains up there, but they are mountains, with their own white arctic snows.",
        "They had emerged at the top of the high stacked cumulo nimbus, and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch eased Arthur in turn from his clothes, prised him free of them till all were gone, winding their surprised way down into the enveloping whiteness.",
        "She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T shape, which might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one flown past, replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a little.",
        "There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the Greater Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the Constellation Fraz, and unlike the Boeing 747 which is in plentiful supply, they are sadly extinct, and the Universe shall never know their like again.",
        "The reason that a Boeing 747 crops up rather unexpectedly in the above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or two later.",
        "They are big things, terrifyingly big.",
        "You know when one is in the air with you.",
        "There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving wall of screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and Fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in the Blitz.",
        "This time, however, there was no heart sickening fall or loss of nerve, a re grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise.",
        "Mrs E.",
        "Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts was an elderly lady, indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end.",
        "She had seen a lot of it, been puzzled by some, but, she was a little uneasy to feel at this late stage, bored by too much.",
        "It had all been very pleasant, but perhaps a little too explicable, a little too routine.",
        "With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and looked out over the wing.",
        "At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then she thought no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and her alone.",
        "By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off the wing and tumbled into the slip stream she had cheered up an awful lot.",
        "She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong.",
        "* * * The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored.",
        "The following night they did it all over again, only this time with Sony Walkmen.",
        "27 \u2018This is all very wonderful,\u2019 said Fenchurch a few days later.",
        "\u2018But I do need to know what has happened to me.",
        "You see, there\u2019s this difference between us.",
        "That you lost something and found it again, and I found something and lost it.",
        "I need to find it again.\u2019 She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day of telephoning.",
        "Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with small pages and big print.",
        "It would be pleasant to be able to say that he was none the worse for this, but sadly, this was not the case.",
        "He happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so Arthur phoned him anyway.",
        "\u2018Arthur, my old soup spoon, my old silver tureen, how particularly stunning to hear from you.",
        "Someone told me you\u2019d gone off into space or something.\u2019 Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able to speak or even to follow.",
        "Hardly any of it meant anything at all.",
        "The bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalanche of nonsense.",
        "The time when you did find out, later, which bits he did mean, was often a bad time for all concerned.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Just a rumour, my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card table, just a rumour.",
        "Probably means nothing at all, but I may need a quote from you.\u2019 \u2018Nothing to say, just pub talk.\u2019 \u2018We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it.",
        "Plus it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the other stories of the week, so it could be just to have you denying it.",
        "Excuse me, something has just fallen out of my ear.\u2019 There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken.",
        "\u2018Just remembered,\u2019 he said, \u2018what an odd evening I had last night.",
        "Anyway my old, I won\u2019t say what, how do you feel about having ridden on Halley\u2019s Comet?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t,\u2019 said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, \u2018ridden on Halley\u2019s Comet.\u2019 \u2018OK.",
        "How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley\u2019s Comet?\u2019 \u2018Pretty relaxed, Murray.\u2019 There was a pause while Murray wrote this down.",
        "\u2018Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and the chickens.",
        "Fits in with the general weirdness of the week.",
        "Week of the Weirdos, we\u2019re thinking of calling it.",
        "Good, eh?\u2019 \u2018Very good.\u2019 \u2018Got a ring to it.",
        "First we have this man it always rains on.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the absolute stocking top truth.",
        "All documented in his little black book, it all checks out at every single fun loving level.",
        "The Met Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds.",
        "This man is the bee\u2019s knees, Arthur, he is the wasp\u2019s nipples.",
        "He is, I would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of every major flying insect of the Western world.",
        "We\u2019re calling him the Rain God.",
        "Nice, eh?\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019ve met him.\u2019 \u2018Good ring to it.",
        "What did you say?\u2019 \u2018I may have met him.",
        "Complains all the time, yes?\u2019 \u2018Incredible! You met the Rain God?\u2019 \u2018If it\u2019s the same guy.",
        "I told him to stop complaining and show someone his book.\u2019 There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson\u2019s end of the phone.",
        "\u2018Well, you did a bundle.",
        "An absolute bundle has absolutely been done by you.",
        "Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is paying that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean forget irrigating the Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a whole new career ahead of him, just avoiding places for money.",
        "The man\u2019s turning into a monster, Arthur, we might even have to make him win the bingo.",
        "\u2018Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who Made the Rain God Rain.",
        "Got a ring to it, eh?\u2019 \u2018A nice one, but...\u2019 \u2018We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but that\u2019ll be OK.",
        "Where are you?\u2019 \u2018Er, I\u2019m in Islington.",
        "Listen, Murray...\u2019 \u2018Islington!\u2019 \u2018Yes...\u2019 \u2018Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real seriously loopy stuff.",
        "You know anything about these flying people?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018You must have.",
        "This is the real seethingly crazy one.",
        "This is the real meatballs in the batter.",
        "Locals are phoning in all the time to say there\u2019s this couple who go flying nights.",
        "We\u2019ve got guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put together a genuine photograph.",
        "You must have heard.\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote.",
        "But that was months ago.",
        "Listen, it\u2019s night after night this week, my old cheesegrater, right on your patch.",
        "This couple just fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff.",
        "And I don\u2019t mean looking through walls or pretending to be box girder bridges.",
        "You don\u2019t know anything?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Arthur, it\u2019s been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with you, chumbum, but I have to go.",
        "I\u2019ll send the guy with the camera and the hose.",
        "Give me the address, I\u2019m ready and writing.\u2019 \u2018Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something.\u2019 \u2018I have a lot to do.\u2019 \u2018I just wanted to find out something about the dolphins.\u2019 \u2018No story.",
        "Last year\u2019s news.",
        "Forget \u2019em.",
        "They\u2019re gone.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s important.\u2019 \u2018Listen, no one will touch it.",
        "You can\u2019t sustain a story, you know, when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever it is the story\u2019s about.",
        "Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays.",
        "Maybe they\u2019ll run a little \u201cWhatever Happened to \u2018Whatever Happened to the Dolphins\u2019\u201d story in a couple of years, around August.",
        "But what\u2019s anybody going to do now? \u201cDolphins Still Gone\u201d? \u201cContinuing Dolphin Absence\u201d? \u201cDolphins \u2013 Further Days Without Them\u201d? The story dies, Arthur.",
        "It lies down and kicks its little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden spike in the sky, my old fruitbat.\u2019 \u2018Murray, I\u2019m not interested in whether it\u2019s a story.",
        "I just want to find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California who claims to know something about it.",
        "I thought you might know.\u2019 28 \u2018People are beginning to talk,\u2019 said Fenchurch that evening, after they had hauled her cello in.",
        "\u2018Not only talk,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018but print, in big bold letters under the bingo prizes.",
        "Which is why I thought I\u2019d better get these.\u2019 He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets.",
        "\u2018Arthur!\u2019 she said, hugging him.",
        "\u2018Does that mean you managed to talk to him?\u2019 \u2018I have had a day,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018of extreme telephonic exhaustion.",
        "I have spoken to virtually every department of virtually every paper in Fleet Street, and I finally tracked his number down.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve obviously been working hard, you\u2019re drenched with sweat, poor darling.\u2019 \u2018Not with sweat,\u2019 said Arthur wearily.",
        "\u2018A photographer\u2019s just been.",
        "I tried to argue, but \u2013 never mind, the point is, yes.\u2019 \u2018You spoke to him.\u2019 \u2018I spoke to his wife.",
        "She said he was too weird to come to the phone right now and could I call back.\u2019 He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went to the fridge to find it.",
        "\u2018Want a drink?\u2019 \u2018Would commit murder to get one.",
        "I always know I\u2019m in for a tough time when my cello teacher looks me up and down and says, \u201cAh yes, my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.\u201d \u2019 \u2018I called again,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018and she said that he was 3.2 light years from the phone and I should call back.\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 \u2018I called again.",
        "She said the situation had improved.",
        "He was now a mere 2.6 light years from the phone but it was still a long way to shout.\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t suppose,\u2019 said Fenchurch, doubtfully, \u2018that there\u2019s anyone else we can talk to?\u2019 \u2018It gets worse,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I spoke to someone on a science magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson will not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof, often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl footwear, that the month\u2019s most fashionable silly theory is true.",
        "For people who question the validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs in question, and that\u2019s as far as you get.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t realize it was that bad,\u2019 said Fenchurch quietly.",
        "She fiddled listlessly with the tickets.",
        "\u2018I phoned Mrs Watson again,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Her name, by the way, and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m glad you see.",
        "I thought you mightn\u2019t believe any of this, so when I called her this time I used the telephone answering machine to record the call.\u2019 He went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which was particularly recommended by Which? magazine and is almost impossible to use without going mad.",
        "\u2018Here it is,\u2019 he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow.",
        "The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a geostationary satellite and back, but was also hauntingly calm.",
        "\u2018Perhaps I should explain,\u2019 Arcane Jill Watson\u2019s voice said, \u2018that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into.",
        "It\u2019s in the Asylum, you see.",
        "Wonko the Sane does not like to enter the Asylum and so he does not.",
        "I feel you should know this because it may save you phoning.",
        "If you would like to meet him, this is very easily arranged.",
        "All you have to do is walk in.",
        "He will only meet people outside the Asylum.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s voice, at its most mystified: \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand.",
        "Where is the asylum?\u2019 \u2018Where is the Asylum?\u2019 Arcane Jill Watson again.",
        "\u2018Have you ever read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?\u2019 On the tape, Arthur\u2019s voice had to admit that he had not.",
        "\u2018You may want to do that.",
        "You may find that it clarifies things for you a little.",
        "You may find that it indicates to you where the Asylum is.",
        "Thank you.\u2019 The sound of the phone line went dead.",
        "Arthur turned the machine off.",
        "\u2018Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation,\u2019 he said with a shrug.",
        "\u2018I actually managed to get the address from the guy on the science magazine.\u2019 Fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and looked at the tickets again.",
        "\u2018Do you think it\u2019s worth it?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018the one thing that everyone I spoke to agreed on, apart from the fact that they all thought he was barking mad, is that he does know more than any man living about dolphins.\u2019 29 \u2018This is an important announcement.",
        "This is flight 121 to Los Angeles.",
        "If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles, now would be the perfect time to disembark.\u2019 30 They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that rents out cars that other people have thrown away.",
        "\u2018Getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem,\u2019 said the guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys, \u2018sometimes it\u2019s simpler just to get out and find a car that\u2019s going in that direction.\u2019 They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by.",
        "\u2018Everyone there is either English or odd or both.",
        "They\u2019ve got a swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers.\u2019 It was true.",
        "There was one and that was exactly what he was doing.",
        "The garage attendant didn\u2019t think much of their car, but that was fine because they didn\u2019t either.",
        "Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling sea of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San Fernando Valley.",
        "They agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped immediately at the back of their eyes and didn\u2019t touch any other part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the spectacle.",
        "As dramatic seas of light went, it was fine, but light is meant to illuminate something, and having driven through what this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they didn\u2019t think much of it.",
        "They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was stupidly hot.",
        "They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at.",
        "\u2018Someone told me,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018that they once overheard two old ladies on this beach, doing what we\u2019re doing, looking at the Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives.",
        "And apparently, after a long pause, one of them said to the other, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not as big as I expected.\u201d \u2019 Their mood gradually lifted as they walked along the beach in Malibu and watched all the millionaires in their chic shanty huts carefully keeping an eye on each other to check how rich they were each getting.",
        "Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any sensibility would dream of building a city like Los Angeles in front of, they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and irrationally happy and didn\u2019t even mind that the terrible old car radio would only play two stations, and those simultaneously.",
        "So what, they were both playing good rock and roll.",
        "\u2018I know that he will be able to help us,\u2019 said Fenchurch determinedly.",
        "\u2018I know he will.",
        "What\u2019s his name again, that he likes to be called?\u2019 \u2018Wonko the Sane.\u2019 \u2018I know that he will be able to help us.\u2019 Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth, whatever this Earth might prove to be.",
        "He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the time they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine, that he would not be called upon to try and remember something that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest recesses of his memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at him.",
        "* * * In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed to be a converted warehouse.",
        "Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious.",
        "Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry.",
        "He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her.",
        "\u2018Why\u2019s this fish so bloody good?\u2019 he demanded, angrily.",
        "\u2018Please excuse my friend,\u2019 said Fenchurch to the startled waitress.",
        "\u2018I think he\u2019s having a nice day at last.\u2019 31 If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would then have something which didn\u2019t exactly look like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar.",
        "He was tall and he gangled.",
        "When he sat in his deckchair gazing at the Pacific, not so much with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep dejection, it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the deckchair ended and he began, and you would hesitate to put your hand on, say, his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off.",
        "But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable.",
        "It seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to you, but which, when he briefly reassembled them in that particular order on his face, made you suddenly feel, \u2018Oh.",
        "Well, that\u2019s all right, then.\u2019 When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made you feel like that pretty often.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018they come and see me.",
        "They sit right here.",
        "They sit right where you\u2019re sitting.\u2019 He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl sandals.",
        "\u2018They eat nachos which they say they can\u2019t get where they come from.",
        "They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things.\u2019 \u2018Do they?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Are they? So, er...",
        "when is this, then? When do they come?\u2019 He gazed out at the Pacific as well.",
        "There were little sandpipers running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave had just washed over, but they couldn\u2019t bear to get their feet wet.",
        "To deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of movement as if they\u2019d been constructed by somebody very clever in Switzerland.",
        "Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it with her fingers.",
        "\u2018Weekends, mostly,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018on little scooters.",
        "They are great machines.\u2019 He smiled.",
        "\u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I see.\u2019 A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked round at her.",
        "She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in the sand of the two of them in the clouds.",
        "For a moment he thought she was trying to get him excited, then he realized that she was rebuking him.",
        "\u2018Who are we,\u2019 she was saying, \u2018to say he\u2019s mad?\u2019 His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first thing that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to know what it was like.",
        "What it was like was this: It was inside out.",
        "Actually inside out, to the extent that they had to park on the carpet.",
        "All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was decorated in a tasteful interior designed pink, were bookshelves, also a couple of those odd three legged tables with semi circular tops which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just dropped the wall straight through them, and pictures which were clearly designed to soothe.",
        "Where it got really odd was the roof.",
        "It folded back on itself like something that Maurits C.",
        "Escher, had he been given to hard nights on the town, which it is no part of this narrative\u2019s purpose to suggest was the case, though it is sometimes hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one with all the awkward steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up after having been on one, for the little chandeliers which should have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up.",
        "Confusing.",
        "The sign above the front door said, \u2018Come Outside\u2019, and so, nervously, they had.",
        "Inside, of course, was where the Outside was.",
        "Rough brickwork, nicely done pointing, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a couple of small trees, some rooms leading off.",
        "And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had Maurits C.",
        "Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to enclose the Pacific Ocean itself.",
        "\u2018Hello,\u2019 said John Watson, Wonko the Sane.",
        "Good, they thought to themselves, \u2018Hello\u2019 is something we can cope with.",
        "\u2018Hello,\u2019 they said, and all surprisingly was smiles.",
        "For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, \u2018I forget...\u2019 whenever they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly round the eccentricities of his house.",
        "\u2018It gives me pleasure,\u2019 he said, \u2018in a curious kind of way, and does nobody any harm,\u2019 he continued, \u2018that a competent optician couldn\u2019t correct.\u2019 They liked him.",
        "He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able to mock himself before anybody else did.",
        "\u2018Your wife,\u2019 said Arthur, looking around, \u2018mentioned some toothpicks.\u2019 He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried that she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention them again.",
        "Wonko the Sane laughed.",
        "It was a light easy laugh, and sounded like one he had used a lot before and was happy with.",
        "\u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s to do with the day I finally realized that the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put it in, poor thing, and hoped it would get better.\u2019 This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous again.",
        "\u2018Here,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018we are outside the Asylum.\u2019 He pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the guttering.",
        "\u2018Go through that door,\u2019 he pointed at the first door through which they had originally entered, \u2018and you go into the Asylum.",
        "I\u2019ve tried to decorate it nicely to keep the inmates happy, but there\u2019s very little one can do.",
        "I never go in there now myself.",
        "If ever I am tempted, which these days I rarely am, I simply look at the sign written over the door and I shy away.\u2019 \u2018That one?\u2019 said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue plaque with some instructions written on it.",
        "\u2018Yes.",
        "They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I have now become.",
        "It was quite sudden.",
        "I saw them, and I knew what I had to do.\u2019 The sign said: Hold stick near centre of its length.",
        "Moisten pointed end in mouth.",
        "Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum.",
        "Use gentle in\u2013out motion.",
        "\u2018It seemed to me,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks was no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane.\u2019 He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and gibber at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the sandpipers.",
        "\u2018And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it possibly might, I am completely sane.",
        "Which is why I call myself Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point.",
        "Wonko is what my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked things over, and sane is what I am, and how,\u2019 he added, with one of his smiles that made you feel, \u2018Oh.",
        "Well, that\u2019s all right, then.\u2019, \u2018I intend to remain.",
        "Shall we go onto the beach and see what we have to talk about?\u2019 They went out onto the beach, which was where he started talking about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl sandals.",
        "\u2018About the dolphins...\u2019 said Fenchurch gently, hopefully.",
        "\u2018I can show you the sandals,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane.",
        "\u2018I wonder, do you know...\u2019 \u2018Would you like me to show you,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane, \u2018the sandals? I have them.",
        "I\u2019ll get them.",
        "They are made by the Dr Scholl company, and the angels say that they particularly suit the terrain they have to work in.",
        "They say they run a concession stand by the message.",
        "When I say I don\u2019t know what that means they say, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d and laugh.",
        "Well, I\u2019ll get them anyway.\u2019 As he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand.",
        "\u2018How are the feet today?\u2019 said Arthur quietly.",
        "It doesn\u2019t feel so odd in the sand.",
        "Or in the water.",
        "The water touches them perfectly.",
        "I just think this isn\u2019t our world.\u2019 She shrugged.",
        "\u2018What do you think he meant,\u2019 she said, \u2018by the message?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Arthur, though the memory of a man called Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him.",
        "When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned Arthur.",
        "Not the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden bottomed sandals.",
        "\u2018I just thought you\u2019d like to see,\u2019 he said, \u2018what angels wear on their feet.",
        "Just out of curiosity.",
        "I\u2019m not trying to prove anything, by the way.",
        "I\u2019m a scientist and I know what constitutes proof.",
        "But the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a child.",
        "If he sees a thing, he must say that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was going to see or not.",
        "See first, think later, then test.",
        "But always see first.",
        "Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting.",
        "Most scientists forget that.",
        "I\u2019ll show you something to demonstrate that later.",
        "So, the other reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think I am a fool.",
        "That allows me to say what I see when I see it.",
        "You can\u2019t possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that you\u2019re a fool.",
        "Anyway, I also thought you might like to see this.\u2019 This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him carrying, for it was a wonderful silver grey glass fish bowl, seemingly identical to the one in Arthur\u2019s bedroom.",
        "Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without success, to say, \u2018Where did you get that?\u2019 sharply, and with a gasp in his voice.",
        "Finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond.",
        "\u2018Where did you get that?\u2019 said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp in her voice.",
        "Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice said, \u2018What? Have you seen one of these before?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019ve got one.",
        "Or at least did have.",
        "Russell nicked it to put his golfballs in.",
        "I don\u2019t know where it came from, just that I was angry with Russell for nicking it.",
        "Why, have you got one?\u2019 \u2018Yes, it was...\u2019 They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing sharply backwards and forwards between them, and trying to get a gasp in edgeways.",
        "\u2018You have one of these too?\u2019 he said to both of them.",
        "\u2018Yes.\u2019 They both said it.",
        "He looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the bowl to catch the light of the Californian sun.",
        "The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around the sand and upon them.",
        "He turned it, and turned it.",
        "They could see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words \u2018So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish.\u2019 \u2018Do you know,\u2019 asked Wonko quietly, \u2018what it is?\u2019 They each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey glass.",
        "\u2018It is a farewell gift from the dolphins,\u2019 said Wonko in a low quiet voice, \u2018the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam with, and fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language, a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult, considering the fact that I now realize they were perfectly capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to.\u2019 He shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur.",
        "\u2018Have you...\u2019 he said to Arthur, \u2018what have you done with yours? May I ask you that?\u2019 \u2018Er, I keep a fish in it,\u2019 said Arthur, slightly embarrassed.",
        "\u2018I happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and er, there was this bowl.\u2019 He tailed off.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ve done nothing else? No,\u2019 he said, \u2018if you had, you would know.\u2019 He shook his head again.",
        "\u2018My wife kept wheatgerm in ours,\u2019 resumed Wonko, with some new tone in his voice, \u2018until last night...\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Arthur slowly and hushedly, \u2018happened last night?\u2019 \u2018We ran out of wheatgerm,\u2019 said Wonko, evenly.",
        "\u2018My wife,\u2019 he added, \u2018has gone to get some more.\u2019 He seemed lost with his own thoughts for a moment.",
        "\u2018And what happened then?\u2019 said Fenchurch, in the same breathless tone.",
        "\u2018I washed it,\u2019 said Wonko.",
        "\u2018I washed it very carefully, very very carefully, removing every last speck of wheat germ, then I dried it slowly with a lint free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it over and over.",
        "Then I held it to my ear.",
        "Have you...",
        "have you held one to your ear?\u2019 They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly.",
        "\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 he said, \u2018you should.\u2019 32 The deep roar of the ocean.",
        "The break of waves on shores further than thought can find.",
        "The silent thunders of the deep.",
        "And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming trillings, wordlings, the half articulated songs of thought.",
        "Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the inarticulate, words breaking together.",
        "A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth.",
        "Waves of joy on \u2013 where? A world indescribably found, indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water.",
        "A fugue of voices now, clamouring for explanations, of a disaster unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words.",
        "And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of it, the flight.",
        "A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins gone.",
        "Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear.",
        "\u2018This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the Humans.",
        "We bid you farewell.\u2019 And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling.",
        "33 That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from inside it.",
        "\u2018This is what I wanted you to see,\u2019 said Wonko the Sane when the news came around again, \u2018an old colleague of mine.",
        "He\u2019s over in your country running an investigation.",
        "Just watch.\u2019 It was a press conference.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t comment on the name Rain God at this present time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para Causal Meteorological Phenomenon.\u2019 \u2018Can you tell us what that means?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not altogether sure.",
        "Let\u2019s be straight here.",
        "If we find something we can\u2019t understand, we like to call it something you can\u2019t understand, or indeed pronounce.",
        "I mean if we just let you go around calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something we don\u2019t, and I\u2019m afraid we couldn\u2019t have that.",
        "\u2018No, first we have to call it something which says it\u2019s ours, not yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it\u2019s not what you said it is, but something we say it is.",
        "\u2018And if it turns out that you\u2019re right, you\u2019ll still be wrong, because we will simply call him a...",
        "er, \u201cSuper normal...\u201d \u2013 not paranormal or supernatural because you think you know what those mean now, no, a \u201cSupernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer\u201d.",

        "Rain God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life.",
        "Admittedly, you wouldn\u2019t catch me going on holiday with him.",
        "Thanks, that\u2019ll be all for now, other than to say \u201cHi!\u201d to Wonko if he\u2019s watching.\u2019 34 On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the plane who was looking at them rather oddly.",
        "They talked quietly to themselves.",
        "\u2018I still have to know,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018and I strongly feel that you know something that you\u2019re not telling me.\u2019 Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper.",
        "\u2018Do you have a pencil?\u2019 he said.",
        "She dug around and found one.",
        "\u2018What are you doing, sweetheart?\u2019 she said, after he had spent twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the paper, crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil again and grunting irritably to himself.",
        "\u2018Trying to remember an address someone once gave me.\u2019 \u2018Your life would be an awful lot simpler,\u2019 she said, \u2018if you bought yourself an address book.\u2019 Finally he passed the paper to her.",
        "\u2018You look after it,\u2019 he said.",
        "She looked at it.",
        "Among all the scratchings and crossings out were the words \u2018Quentulus Quazgar Mountains.",
        "Sevorbeupstry.",
        "Planet of Preliumtarn.",
        "Sun Zarss.",
        "Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma.\u2019 \u2018And what\u2019s there?\u2019 \u2018Apparently,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation.\u2019 \u2018That sounds a bit more like it,\u2019 said Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018How do we get there?\u2019 \u2018You really...?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Fenchurch firmly, \u2018I really want to know.\u2019 Arthur looked out of the scratchy little Perspex window at the open sky outside.",
        "\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 said the woman, who had been looking at them rather oddly, suddenly, \u2018I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m rude.",

        "Tell me, do you fly a lot?\u2019 35 They went to Arthur\u2019s house in the West Country, shoved a couple of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every Galactic hitchhiker ends up spending most of his time doing.",
        "They waited for a flying saucer to come by.",

        "\u2018Who was that?\u2019 \u2018Called Ford Prefect.\u2019 He caught himself doing something he had never really expected to do again.",
        "He wondered where Ford Prefect was.",
        "By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing incident with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of unseemly riots in pubs.",
        "Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and complaining that Arthur never answered the phone.",
        "In fact, he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he\u2019d been pulled through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester.",
        "He staggered into Arthur\u2019s sitting room, waving aside all offers of support, which was an error, because the effort of waving caused him to lose his balance altogether and Arthur had eventually to drag him to the sofa.",
        "\u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018thank you very much.",
        "Have you...\u2019 he said, and fell asleep for three hours.",
        "the faintest idea,\u2019 he continued suddenly, when he revived, \u2018how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the Pleiades? I can see that you haven\u2019t, so I\u2019ll tell you,\u2019 he said, \u2018over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to make me.\u2019 He followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen.",

        "\u201cAnd the reason,\u201d I said, \u201cwhy I am bothering you with it rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out here in the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny pinching son of a star beast piloting this son of a starbeast starship insists that I call collect.",
        "Can you believe that?\u201d \u2019 \u2018And could she?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know.",
        "She had hung up,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018by this time.",
        "So! What do you suppose,\u2019 he asked fiercely, \u2018I did next?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve no idea, Ford,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Pity,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I was hoping you could remind me.",
        "I really hate those guys, you know.",
        "They really are the creeps of the cosmos, buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky little machines that never work properly or, when they do, perform functions that no sane man would require of them and,\u2019 he added savagely, \u2018go beep to tell you when they\u2019ve done it!\u2019 This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held by right thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being right thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five million, nine hundred and seventy five thousand, five hundred and nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that \u2018it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all.",
        "\u2018In other words \u2013 and this is the rock solid principle on which the whole of the Corporation\u2019s Galaxy wide success is founded \u2013 their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their superficial design flaws.\u2019 \u2018And this guy,\u2019 ranted Ford, \u2018was on a drive to sell more of them! His five year mission to seek out and explore strange new worlds, and sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their restaurants, elevators and wine bars! Or if they didn\u2019t have restaurants, elevators and wine bars yet, to artificially accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did have! Where\u2019s that coffee!\u2019 \u2018I threw it away.\u2019 \u2018Make some more.",
        "I have now remembered what I did next.",
        "I saved civilization as we know it.",
        "I knew it was something like that.\u2019 He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the furniture and making beep beep noises.",
        "A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur followed him.",
        "Ford looked stunned.",
        "\u2018Where have you been?\u2019 he demanded.",
        "\u2018Making some coffee,\u2019 said Arthur, still wearing his very placid face.",
        "He had long ago realized that the only way of being in Ford\u2019s company successfully was to keep a large stock of very placid faces and wear them at all times.",
        "\u2018You missed the best bit!\u2019 raged Ford.",
        "\u2018You missed the bit where I jumped the guy! Now,\u2019 he said, \u2018I shall have to jump him, all over him!\u2019 He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it.",
        "\u2018It was better,\u2019 he said sullenly, \u2018last time,\u2019 and waved vaguely in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got trussed up on the dining table.",
        "\u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up wreckage, \u2018and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 screamed Ford.",
        "\u2018What? You missed that bit too? That\u2019s the suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended animation facility.",
        "Well, I had to, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 \u2018So it would seem,\u2019 said Arthur, in his placid voice.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t touch that!!!\u2019 yelled Ford.",
        "Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused, placidly.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 said Ford, calming down, \u2018listen to it.\u2019 Arthur put the phone to his ear.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s the speaking clock,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Beep, beep, beep,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018is exactly what is being heard all over that guy\u2019s ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going slowly round a little known moon of Sesefras Magna.",
        "The London Speaking Clock!\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to ask the big one.",
        "\u2018Why?\u2019 he said, placidly.",
        "\u2018With a bit of luck,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the phone bill will bankrupt the buggers.\u2019 He threw himself, sweating, on to the sofa.",
        "\u2018Anyway,\u2019 he said, \u2018dramatic arrival, don\u2019t you think?\u2019 36 The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had stunned the world.",
        "Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in reservoirs.",
        "This time it was real, it was definite.",
        "It was quite definitely definite.",
        "It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real estate in the world, including much of Harrods.",
        "The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull silver in colour, pitted, scorched and disfigured with the scars of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by the light of suns unknown to man.",
        "A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Harrods Food Halls, demolished Harvey Nichols, and with a final grinding scream of tortured architecture toppled the Sheraton Park Tower.",
        "After a long, heart stopping moment of internal crashes and grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall.",
        "It held up a hand.",
        "\u2018I come in peace,\u2019 it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, \u2018take me to your Lizard.\u2019 Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with Arthur and watched the nonstop frenetic news reports on the television, none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting short incomprehensible error messages.",
        "\u2018It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...\u2019 \u2018You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, \u2018nothing so simple.",
        "Nothing anything like so straightforward.",
        "On its world, the people are people.",
        "The leaders are lizards.",
        "The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.\u2019 \u2018Odd,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I thought you said it was a democracy.\u2019 \u2018I did,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018It is.\u2019 \u2018So,\u2019 said Arthur, hoping he wasn\u2019t sounding ridiculously obtuse, \u2018why don\u2019t people get rid of the lizards?\u2019 \u2018It honestly doesn\u2019t occur to them,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018They\u2019ve all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they\u2019ve voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.\u2019 \u2018You mean they actually vote for the lizards?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Ford with a shrug, \u2018of course.\u2019 \u2018But,\u2019 said Arthur, going for the big one again, \u2018why?\u2019 \u2018Because if they didn\u2019t vote for a lizard,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the wrong lizard might get in.",
        "Got any gin?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I said,\u2019 said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, \u2018have you got any gin?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll look.",
        "Tell me about the lizards.\u2019 Ford shrugged again.",
        "\u2018Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018They\u2019re completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone\u2019s got to say it.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s terrible,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Listen, bud,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018if I had one Altairian dollar for every time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the Universe and say \u201cThat\u2019s terrible\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here like a lemon looking for a gin.",
        "But I haven\u2019t and I am.",
        "Anyway, what are you looking so placid and moon eyed for? Are you in love?\u2019 Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly.",
        "\u2018With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to meet her?\u2019 He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of newspapers she\u2019d been into the village to buy.",
        "She stopped in astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from Betelgeuse on the sofa.",
        "\u2018Where\u2019s the gin?\u2019 said Ford to Fenchurch.",
        "And to Arthur, \u2018What happened to Trillian, by the way?\u2019 \u2018Er, this is Fenchurch,\u2019 said Arthur, awkwardly.",
        "\u2018There was nothing with Trillian, you must have seen her last.\u2019 \u2018Oh, yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018she went off with Zaphod somewhere.",
        "They had some kids or something.",
        "At least,\u2019 he added, \u2018I think that\u2019s what they were.",
        "Zaphod\u2019s calmed down a lot, you know.\u2019 \u2018Really?\u2019 said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to relieve her of the shopping.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018at least one of his heads is now saner than an emu on acid.\u2019 \u2018Arthur, who is this?\u2019 said Fenchurch.",
        "\u2018Ford Prefect,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I may have mentioned him in passing.\u2019 37 For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood in stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge, swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things.",
        "Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they thought of it, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to attack it \u2013 but no lizards appeared.",
        "It scanned the horizon slowly.",
        "At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously did nothing.",
        "It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion.",
        "It would have to send out its service robots.",
        "It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number of problems.",
        "The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal.",
        "They roamed the surrounding terrain, frantically attacking some things and defending others.",
        "One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that little in the area survived.",
        "A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers discovered the Zoo in Regent\u2019s Park, and most particularly the Reptile House.",
        "Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the petshop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to conduct high level talks with them.",
        "Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the full, frank and wide ranging exchange of views the high level talks had broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it, the robot, would take a short holiday somewhere, and for some reason selected Bournemouth.",
        "Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another beer.",
        "Immediate preparations were made for its departure.",
        "The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried things with light throughout that day and all through the night time, and in the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously with the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry.",
        "Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival, buzzed around by its servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the land until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly freed itself of its transport system\u2019s embraces and went and lay for ten days on the beach.",
        "It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever happened to Bournemouth.",
        "Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out and guarded as the robot\u2019s recreation area, and tried to see what it was doing.",
        "It was doing nothing.",
        "It was lying on the beach.",
        "It was lying a little awkwardly on its face.",
        "It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night, managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed, which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one of the service robots guarding the perimeter.",
        "It was an extraordinary breakthrough.",
        "\u2018I think there\u2019s a story in it,\u2019 confided the journalist over a cigarette shared through the steel link fence, \u2018but it needs a good local angle.",
        "I\u2019ve got a little list of questions here,\u2019 he went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket, \u2018perhaps you could get him, it, whatever you call him, to run through them quickly.\u2019 The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it could do and screeched off.",
        "A reply was never forthcoming.",
        "Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or less exactly matched the questions that were going through the massive battle scarred industrial quality circuits of the robot\u2019s mind.",
        "They were these: \u2018How do you feel about being a robot?\u2019 \u2018How does it feel to be from outer space?\u2019 and \u2018How do you like Bournemouth?\u2019 Early the following day things started to be packed up and within a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to leave for good.",
        "\u2018The point is,\u2019 said Fenchurch to Ford, \u2018can you get us on board?\u2019 Ford looked wildly at his watch.",
        "\u2018I have some serious unfinished business to attend to,\u2019 he exclaimed.",
        "38 Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft, which wasn\u2019t very.",
        "The immediate perimeter was fenced off and patrolled by the tiny flying service robots.",
        "Staked out around that was the army, who had been completely unable to breach that inner perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach them.",
        "They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though whether they were there to protect the public from the army or the army from the public, or to guarantee the giant ship\u2019s diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was entirely unclear and the subject of much debate.",
        "The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled.",
        "The army stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that the reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going to get up and go.",
        "The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime, and now it was five o\u2019clock in the afternoon and no further sign had been seen of it.",
        "Much had been heard \u2013 more grindings and rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be disappointed.",
        "This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into their lives, and now it was simply going to go without them.",
        "Two people were particularly aware of this sensation.",
        "Arthur and Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford Prefect in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest intention of being there.",
        "\u2018How reliable is he?\u2019 asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice.",
        "\u2018How reliable?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "He gave a hollow laugh.",
        "\u2018How shallow is the ocean?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018How cold is the sun?\u2019 The last parts of the robot\u2019s gantry transport were being carried on board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow them.",
        "The soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully, orders were barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held, but nothing, of course, could be done about any of it.",
        "Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them nowhere.",
        "And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship, every last link of the fence was aboard.",
        "A couple of flying fretsaws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the site, and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves.",
        "A few seconds passed.",
        "The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in intensity, and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift itself back out of the Harrods Food Halls.",
        "The sound that accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense, excited people being completely ignored.",
        "\u2018Hold it!\u2019 A megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the edge of the milling crowd.",
        "\u2018There has been,\u2019 barked the megaphone, \u2018a major scientific break in! Through.",
        "Breakthrough,\u2019 it corrected itself.",
        "The door flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat.",
        "\u2018Hold it!\u2019 he shouted again, and this time brandished a short squat black rod with lights on it.",
        "The lights winked briefly, the ramp paused in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals from the Thumb (which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming, while the other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming the jamming signals), slowly ground its way downwards again.",
        "Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and started bawling at the crowd through it.",
        "\u2018Make way,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018make way, please, this is a major scientific breakthrough.",
        "You and you, get the equipment from the taxi.\u2019 Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently round the taxi.",
        "\u2018All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some important pieces of scientific equipment,\u2019 boomed Ford.",
        "\u2018Just everybody keep calm.",
        "It\u2019s all under control, there\u2019s nothing to see.",
        "It is merely a major scientific breakthrough.",
        "Keep calm now.",
        "Important scientific equipment.",
        "Clear the way.\u2019 Hungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started to open up.",
        "Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi.",
        "\u2018Hang your coat over them,\u2019 he muttered to Fenchurch as he heaved them out to her.",
        "Hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat.",
        "It clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes into it.",
        "\u2018Clear a path, please,\u2019 shouted Ford again.",
        "\u2018Everything\u2019s under proper scientific control.\u2019 \u2018He said you\u2019d pay,\u2019 said the taxi driver to Arthur, who dug out some notes and paid him.",
        "There was the distant sound of police sirens.",
        "\u2018Move along there,\u2019 shouted Ford, \u2018and no one will get hurt.\u2019 The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through the rubble towards the ramp.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 Ford continued to bellow.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s nothing to see, it\u2019s all over.",
        "None of this is actually happening.\u2019 \u2018Clear the way, please,\u2019 boomed a police megaphone from the back of the crowd.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s been a break in, clear the way.\u2019 \u2018Breakthrough,\u2019 yelled Ford in competition.",
        "\u2018A scientific breakthrough!\u2019 \u2018This is the police! Clear the way!\u2019 \u2018Scientific equipment! Clear the way!\u2019 \u2018Police! Let us through!\u2019 \u2018Walkmen!\u2019 yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd.",
        "The resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up on to the lip of it.",
        "\u2018Hold tight,\u2019 muttered Ford, and released a button on his Electronic Thumb.",
        "Beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and began slowly to heave its way upwards.",
        "\u2018OK, kids,\u2019 he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp into the bowels of the ship, \u2018looks like we\u2019re on our way.\u2019 39 Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound of gunfire.",
        "Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves, slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors moodily.",
        "They were claustrophobic and ill lit.",
        "The lighting circuits buzzed annoyingly.",
        "That wasn\u2019t it, though.",
        "He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so.",
        "That wasn\u2019t it either.",
        "He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a larger corridor.",
        "Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he walked towards the other.",
        "He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a plate of toughened but still badly scratched Perspex.",
        "\u2018Would you turn it down, please?\u2019 he said to Ford Prefect, who was crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video equipment he\u2019d taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road, having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty heap of empty beer cans.",
        "\u2018Shhhh!\u2019 hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the screen.",
        "He was watching The Magnificent Seven.",
        "\u2018Just a bit,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018No!\u2019 shouted Ford.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re just getting to the good bit! Listen, I finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion, everything, and this is the good bit!\u2019 With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and watched the good bit.",
        "He listened to Ford\u2019s whoops and yells and \u2018yeeehay!\u2019s as placidly as he could.",
        "\u2018Ford,\u2019 he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca, \u2018how come, if...\u2019 \u2018This is the big one,\u2019 said Ford.",

        "When they blew the place up I thought I\u2019d never get to see it.",
        "Hey, what happened with all that, anyway?\u2019 \u2018Just life,\u2019 said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six pack.",
        "\u2018Oh, that again,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018I thought it might be something like that.",
        "I prefer this stuff,\u2019 he said as Rick\u2019s Bar flickered on to the screen.",
        "\u2018How come if what?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018You started to say, \u201chow come if...\u201d \u2019 \u2018How come if you\u2019re so rude about the Earth, that you...",
        "oh never mind, let\u2019s just watch the movie.\u2019 \u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "40 There remains little still to tell.",
        "Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of Flanux until the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were discovered lying behind them, lie the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine.",
        "Within the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the star named Zarss, around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn on which is the land of Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of Sevorbeupstry that Arthur and Fenchurch came at last, a little tired by the journey.",
        "And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red Plain of Rars, which was bounded on the south side by the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, on the further side of which, according to the dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty foot high letters of fire God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation.",
        "According to Prak, if Arthur\u2019s memory served him right, the place was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a manner, it proved to be.",
        "He was a little man in a strange hat and he sold them a ticket.",
        "\u2018Keep to the left, please,\u2019 he said, \u2018keep to the left,\u2019 and hurried on past them on a little scooter.",
        "They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the path that led around the left of the Great Plain was well worn and dotted with booths.",
        "At one they bought a box of fudge, which had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain which was heated by the fire of the letters that formed God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation.",
        "At another they bought some postcards.",
        "The letters had been blurred with an air brush, \u2018So as not to spoil the Big Surprise!\u2019 it said on the reverse.",
        "\u2018Do you know what the message is?\u2019 they asked the wizened little lady in the booth.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 she piped cheerily, \u2018oh yes!\u2019 She waved them on.",
        "Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with showers and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the high sun baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red Plain rippled in the heat.",
        "\u2018Is it possible,\u2019 asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, \u2018to rent one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic Ventrawhatsit had?\u2019 \u2018The scooters,\u2019 said the little lady who was serving at the ice cream bar, \u2018are not for the devout.\u2019 \u2018Oh well, that\u2019s easy, then,\u2019 said Fenchurch, \u2018we\u2019re not particularly devout.",
        "We\u2019re just interested.\u2019 \u2018Then you must turn back now,\u2019 said the little lady severely, and when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sunhats and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each other on the Great Red Plain of Rars.",
        "They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then trudged out into the sun again.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re running out of barrier cream,\u2019 said Fenchurch after a few more miles.",
        "\u2018We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our steps.\u2019 They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat haze; they looked behind themselves.",
        "They elected to go on.",
        "They then discovered that they were not only not the first to make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making it now.",
        "Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half limping, half crawling.",
        "It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred and twisted metal.",
        "It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot dry dust.",
        "\u2018So much time,\u2019 it groaned, \u2018oh so much time.",
        "And pain as well, so much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too.",
        "One or the other on its own I could probably manage.",
        "It\u2019s the two together that really get me down.",
        "Oh hello, you again.\u2019 \u2018Marvin?\u2019 said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it.",
        "\u2018Is that you?\u2019 \u2018You were always one,\u2019 groaned the aged husk of the robot, \u2018for the super intelligent question, weren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018What is it?\u2019 whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind Arthur, and grasping on to his arm.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s sort of an old friend,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I...\u2019 \u2018Friend!\u2019 croaked the robot pathetically.",
        "The word died away in a kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of his mouth.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ll have to excuse me while I try and remember what the word means.",
        "My memory banks are not what they were, you know, and any word which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get shifted down into auxiliary memory back up.",
        "Ah, here it comes.\u2019 The robot\u2019s battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought.",
        "\u2018Hmm,\u2019 he said, \u2018what a curious concept.\u2019 He thought a little longer.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018don\u2019t think I ever came across one of those.",
        "Sorry, can\u2019t help you there.\u2019 He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, and then tried to twist himself up on to his misshapen elbows.",
        "\u2018Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you, perhaps?\u2019 he asked in a kind of hollow rattle.",
        "\u2018A piece of paper that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you would like me,\u2019 he continued, \u2018to open a door?\u2019 His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to scan the distant horizon.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t seem to be any doors around at present,\u2019 he said, \u2018but I\u2019m sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one.",
        "And then,\u2019 he said slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur again, \u2018I could open it for you.",
        "I\u2019m quite used to waiting, you know.\u2019 \u2018Arthur,\u2019 hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, \u2018you never told me of this.",
        "What have you done to this poor creature?\u2019 \u2018Nothing,\u2019 insisted Arthur sadly, \u2018he\u2019s always like this...\u2019 \u2018Ha!\u2019 snapped Marvin.",
        "\u2018Ha!\u2019 he repeated.",
        "\u2018What do you know of always? You say \u201calways\u201d to me, who, because of the silly little errands you organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now thirty seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words with a little more care,\u2019 he coughed, \u2018and tact.\u2019 He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed.",
        "\u2018Leave me,\u2019 he said, \u2018go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully on my way.",
        "My time at last is nearly come.",
        "My race is nearly run.",
        "I fully expect,\u2019 he said, feebly waving them on with a broken finger, \u2018to come in last.",
        "It would be fitting.",
        "Here I am, brain the size...\u2019 Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and insults.",
        "The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers, but he weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their arms.",
        "They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left of the Great Red Plain of Rars towards the encircling mountains of Quentulus Quazgar.",
        "Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often interrupted by Marvin\u2019s dolorous cybernetic ravings.",
        "They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one of the booths, and some soothing oil, but Marvin would have none of it.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m all spare parts,\u2019 he droned.",
        "\u2018Let me be!\u2019 he groaned.",
        "\u2018Every part of me,\u2019 he moaned, \u2018has been replaced at least fifty times...",
        "except...\u2019 He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten for a moment.",
        "His head bobbed between them with the effort of memory.",
        "\u2018Do you remember, the first time you ever met me,\u2019 he said at last to Arthur, \u2018I had been given the intellect stretching task of taking you up to the bridge? I mentioned to you that I had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side? That I had asked for them to be replaced but they never were?\u2019 He left a longish pause before he continued.",
        "They carried him on between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to move, let alone set.",
        "\u2018See if you can guess,\u2019 said Marvin, when he judged that the pause had become embarrassing enough, \u2018which parts of me were never replaced? Go on, see if you can guess.",
        "\u2018Ouch,\u2019 he added, \u2018ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.\u2019 At last they reached the last of the little booths, set down Marvin between them and rested in the shade.",
        "Fenchurch bought some cufflinks for Russell, cufflinks that had set in them little polished pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in which was written God\u2019s Final Message to His Creation.",
        "Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message.",
        "\u2018Ready?\u2019 he said to Fenchurch, who nodded.",
        "They heaved Marvin up between them.",
        "They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest of the Mountain.",
        "There was a little observation vantage point with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it, from which you could get a good view.",
        "It had a little pay telescope for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the heavens and would, if seen through a telescope, have severely damaged the retina and optic nerve.",
        "They gazed at God\u2019s Final Message in wonderment, and were slowly and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final and complete understanding.",
        "Fenchurch sighed.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018that was it.\u2019 They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in difficulties.",
        "The robot could no longer lift his head, had not read the message.",
        "They lifted his head, but he complained that his vision circuits had almost gone.",
        "They found a coin and helped him to the telescope.",
        "He complained and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual letter in turn.",
        "The first letter was a \u2018w\u2019, the second an \u2018e\u2019.",
        "Then there was a gap.",
        "An \u2018a\u2019 followed, then a \u2018p\u2019, an \u2018o\u2019 and an \u2018l\u2019.",
        "Marvin paused for a rest.",
        "After a few moments they resumed and let him see the \u2018o\u2019, the \u2018g\u2019, the \u2018i\u2019, the \u2018s\u2019 and the \u2018e\u2019.",
        "The next two words were \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019.",
        "The last one was a long one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it.",
        "It started with \u2018i\u2019, then \u2018n\u2019 then a \u2018c\u2019.",
        "Next came an \u2018o\u2019 and an \u2018n\u2019, followed by a \u2018v\u2019, an \u2018e\u2019, another \u2018n\u2019 and an \u2018i\u2019.",
        "After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last stretch.",
        "He read the \u2018e\u2019, the \u2018n\u2019, the \u2018c\u2019 and at last the final \u2018e\u2019, and staggered back into their arms.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding rattling thorax, \u2018I feel good about it.\u2019 The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever.",
        "Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters from guys with green wings.",
        "Epilogue One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who couldn\u2019t keep his mind on the job in hand.",
        "Brilliant? Certainly.",
        "One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other generation, including a number he had designed himself? Without a doubt.",
        "The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he shouldn\u2019t be interested in, at least, as people would tell him, not now.",
        "He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable disposition.",
        "So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast, he, Blart Versenwald III (his name was Blart Versenwald III, which is not strictly relevant, but quite interesting because \u2013 never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why it\u2019s interesting later), was sent into guarded seclusion by the masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the feared invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, \u2018Concentrate!\u2019 So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were practically in orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable new breed of super fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly through the open half of a half open window, and also an off switch for children.",
        "Celebrations of these remarkable achievements seemed doomed to be shortlived because disaster was imminent as the alien ships were landing.",
        "But astoundingly, the fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races, were only on the rampage because they couldn\u2019t cope with things at home, were stunned by Versenwald\u2019s extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a wide ranging series of trading agreements and set up a programme of cultural exchanges.",
        "And, in an astonishing reversal of normal practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned lived happily ever after.",
        "There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler\u2019s mind.",

        "An extract follows here from MOSTLY HARMLESS 1 The history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a number of reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things have been happening anyway.",
        "One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it.",
        "You can\u2019t.",
        "Nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.",
        "The Hingefreel people of Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad news but they didn\u2019t work particularly well and were so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasn\u2019t really any point in being there.",
        "So, by and large, the peoples of the Galaxy tended to languish in their own local muddles and the history of the Galaxy itself was, for a long time, largely cosmological.",
        "Which is not to say that people weren\u2019t trying.",
        "They tried sending off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts, but these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere.",
        "By the time they eventually arrived, other forms of travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light, so that whatever battles it was that the slower than light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by the time they actually got there.",
        "This didn\u2019t, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight the battles anyway.",
        "They were trained, they were ready, they\u2019d had a couple of thousand years\u2019 sleep, they\u2019d come a long way to do a tough job and by Zarquon they were going to do it.",
        "This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set in, with battles continually re erupting centuries after the issues they had been fought over had supposedly been settled.",
        "However, these muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once time travel was discovered and battles started pre erupting hundreds of years before the issues even arose.",
        "When the Infinite Improbability Drive arrived and whole planets started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the great history faculty of the University of Maximegalon finally gave up, closed itself down and surrendered its buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of Divinity and Water Polo, which had been after them for years.",
        "Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly means that no one will ever know for sure where, for instance, the Grebulons came from, or exactly what it was they wanted.",
        "And this is a pity, because if anybody had known anything about them, it is just possible that a most terrible catastrophe would have been averted \u2013 or at least would have had to find a different way to happen.",
        "Click, hum.",
        "The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black void.",
        "It was travelling at fabulous, breathtaking speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background of a billion distant stars, to be moving not at all.",

        "The higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed to get, and the low level supervising program said that it couldn\u2019t remember exactly, but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh, wasn\u2019t it? It didn\u2019t know what this hum was.",
        "Click, hum, click, hum.",
        "That was all it was getting.",
        "The higher level supervising program considered this and didn\u2019t like it.",
        "It asked the low level supervising program what exactly it was supervising and the low level supervising program said it couldn\u2019t remember that either, just that it was something that was meant to go click, sigh every ten years or so, which usually happened without fail.",
        "It had tried to consult its error look up table but couldn\u2019t find it, which was why it had alerted the higher level supervising program to the problem.",

        "The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems.",
        "It called its supervising agent which hit problems too.",
        "Within a few millionths of a second virtual circuits that had lain dormant, some for years, some for centuries, were flaring into life throughout the ship.",
        "Something, somewhere, had gone terribly wrong, but none of the supervising programs could tell what it was.",
        "At every level, vital instructions were missing, and the instructions about what to do in the event of discovering that vital instructions were missing, were also missing.",
        "Small modules of software \u2013 agents \u2013 surged through the logical pathways, grouping, consulting, re grouping.",
        "They quickly established that the ship\u2019s memory, all the way back to its central mission module, was in tatters.",
        "No amount of interrogation could determine what it was that had happened.",
        "Even the central mission module itself seemed to be damaged.",
        "This made the whole problem very simple to deal with.",
        "Replace the central mission module.",
        "There was another one, a backup, an exact duplicate of the original.",
        "It had to be physically replaced because, for safety reasons, there was no link whatsoever between the original and its backup.",
        "Once the central mission module was replaced it could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail, and all would be well.",
        "Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the shielded strong room, where they guarded it, to the ship\u2019s logic chamber for installation.",
        "This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity of the instructions.",
        "At last the robots were satisfied that all procedures were correct.",
        "They unpacked the backup central mission module from its storage housing, carried it out of the storage chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void.",
        "This provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong.",
        "Further investigation quickly established what it was that had happened.",
        "A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship.",
        "The ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly knocked out that part of the ship\u2019s processing equipment which was supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a meteorite.",
        "The first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole.",
        "This turned out to be impossible, because the ship\u2019s sensors couldn\u2019t see that there was a hole, and the supervisors which should have said that the sensors weren\u2019t working properly weren\u2019t working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine.",
        "The ship could only deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it, taking its spare brain, which would have enabled it to see the hole, with them.",
        "The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then blanked out completely for a bit.",
        "It didn\u2019t realize it had blanked out, of course, because it had blanked out.",
        "It was merely surprised to see the stars jump.",
        "After the third time the stars jumped the ship finally realized that it must be blanking out, and that it was time to take some serious decisions.",
        "It relaxed.",
        "Then it realized it hadn\u2019t actually taken the serious decisions yet and panicked.",
        "It blanked out again for a bit.",
        "When it awoke again it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must be.",
        "It clearly hadn\u2019t got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully, but since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destination was or how to reach it, there seemed to be little point in continuing.",

        "Before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass on those instructions, such as they were, to its more primitive subsidiary systems.",
        "It must also revive all of its crew.",
        "There was another problem.",
        "While the crew was in hibernation, the minds of all of its members, their memories, their identities and their understanding of what they had come to do, had all been transferred into the ship\u2019s central mission module for safe keeping.",
        "The crew would not have the faintest idea of who they were or what they were doing there.",
        "Oh well.",
        "Just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realized that its engines were beginning to give out too.",
        "The ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under the control of its subsidiary automatic systems, which simply looked to land wherever they could find to land and monitor whatever they could find to monitor.",
        "As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they didn\u2019t do very well.",
        "The planet they found was desolately cold and lonely, so achingly far from the sun that should warm it, that it took all of the Envir O Form machinery and LifeSupport O Systems they carried with them to render it, or at least enough parts of it, habitable.",
        "There were better planets nearer in, but the ship\u2019s Strateej O Mat was obviously locked into Lurk mode and chose the most distant and unobtrusive planet and, furthermore, would not be gainsaid by anybody other than the ship\u2019s Chief Strategic Officer.",
        "Since everybody on the ship had lost their minds no one knew who the Chief Strategic Officer was or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed to go about gainsaying the ship\u2019s Strateej O Mat.",
        "As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though, they hit solid gold.",
