I am the only person who ever got a manuscript from Douglas Adams on time. The reason for this rare distinction is that I was the BBC producer who commissioned the first radio script for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and since the pilot episode could not be recorded until we had some words to record, Douglas duly delivered on time. Thereafter, of course, his propensity towards procrastination and missed deadlines became legendary. I had first met Douglas with a bunch of other Cambridge revue writers and performers, including John Lloyd, Griff Rhys Jones and Mary Allen. He had contributed a few surreal sketches (including a classic about an unsuccessful kamikaze pilot) to a Cambridge Footlights revue to which a group of young radio Light Entertainment producers (including me) had paid a visit. I subsequently produced a radio version of that stage show. So I saw a lot of Douglas round the BBC. I was aware of his comedy potential, but also of his huge frustration that he couldn\u2019t find a niche for his unusual talents. Most radio comedy round that time was very stratified. Sketches were carefully structured with beginnings, middles and punchlines, and formats like that didn\u2019t suit the sprawling, insatiable intellectual curiosity of Douglas\u2019s mind. I was also then producing the topical comedy programme Week Ending, and tried to get him to contribute to that. Never had there been a greater mismatch between programme and writer. A brain like Douglas\u2019s is singularly incapable of writing wacky thirty second quickies about Margaret Thatcher. Some of his material did appear in The Burkiss Way, another show I was producing, and that was closer to the Adams style. But the show\u2019s main writers, David Renwick and Andrew Marshall (both subsequently to have stellar careers in television comedy), were developing the programme in a way which left little room for outside contributions. I still thought there was untapped potential in Douglas Adams, and so I asked him to come up with some ideas for a show of his own. On Friday 18 February 1977 we met for lunch in a Japanese restaurant, where he presented me with three ideas. I said that I thought the most promising was the science fiction comedy which he had entitled The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and that I would try to persuade my bosses in the Light Entertainment Department to commission a pilot script. The rest, as they say, is history. (And, incidentally, neither Douglas nor I could ever remember what the two ideas we rejected were.) So, on Tuesday 28 June 1977, in the Paris Studio in Lower Regent Street, we recorded the pilot script of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. It was to be the first and last episode that I produced. Not that I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to continue, but I had recently agreed to take a new job at London Weekend Television. And the ensuing series couldn\u2019t have been in better hands than those of the person I recommended should take over from me \u2013 Geoffrey Perkins, a brilliant comedy producer, whose death, like Douglas\u2019s own, came far too early. On the 12 July I played back the edited recording of the pilot to my immediate bosses. The three of them sat in stony silence for the full half hour. At the end of the playback the Head of Light Entertainment, Con Mahoney, recognizing that what he had just heard was rather different from the department\u2019s usual output, asked me, \u2018Simon, is it funny?\u2019 I assured him it was, and from that moment on he gave the project his full support. Of course it was from that pilot script that The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy developed into an international publishing sensation, the \u2018trilogy of five\u2019, of which Life, the Universe and Everything is volume three. In this book you will find all of the trademarks of Douglas Adams\u2019s writing, of which probably the most striking is his sheer glee in the potentialities of the English language. Sometimes the effects are very simple, as when he says of the party spaceship, \u2018It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead.\u2019 Other images are more complex, but always note perfect. Here\u2019s a description of the Norse god Thor: \u2018He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you.\u2019 Then there are the words Douglas makes up. In a characteristic scene where a mattress engages in conversation with Marvin the Paranoid Android, we encounter \u2018flolloped\u2019, \u2018globbered\u2019 and \u2018vollued\u2019, none of which would have been out of place in Lewis Carroll\u2019s Jabberwocky. I think Douglas\u2019s was the most original mind I\u2019ve ever encountered. He had a unique ability to make connections between disparate ideas. In the world of Hitchhiker it appears quite logical that a drinks party should hurtle endlessly through space, or that a new mathematical system should be based on people\u2019s behaviour in restaurants. Life, the Universe and Everything is the book in which Douglas gets closest to actually having a plot. But as he would readily admit, he wasn\u2019t really good at plots, and it isn\u2019t a very good plot. That couldn\u2019t matter less, though. You don\u2019t read Douglas Adams for his plots any more than you read Raymond Chandler for his. You read both authors for their language and the imaginative world that they create. So enjoy this book. The writing process for Douglas was an agonizingly slow one, but the results were always worth waiting for. And Life, the Universe and Everything has another rare distinction. It is one of the very few books featuring cricket ever to have been a success in the States. SIMON BRETT Producer of the Radio 4 pilot episode of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy 1 The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was. It wasn\u2019t just that the cave was cold, it wasn\u2019t just that it was damp and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington and there wasn\u2019t a bus due for two million years. Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy. He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he had ever dreamt existed, and though life had now turned very, very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy. He hadn\u2019t been blown up now for five years. Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had parted company four years previously, he hadn\u2019t been insulted in all that time either. Except just once. It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously. He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He turned and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart. Rescue. Escape. The cast away\u2019s impossible dream \u2013 a ship. And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm. A ramp extended itself. Light streamed out. A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur. \u2018You\u2019re a jerk, Dent,\u2019 it said simply. It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly draped golden robes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale grey green alien skin which had about it that lustrous sheen which most grey green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap. Arthur boggled at it. It gazed levelly at him. Arthur\u2019s first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal cords at this moment. \u2018Whh \u2026 ?\u2019 he said. \u2018Bu \u2026 hu \u2026 uh \u2026\u2019 he added. \u2018Ru \u2026 ra \u2026 wah \u2026 who?\u2019 he managed finally to say and lapsed into a frantic kind of silence. He was feeling the effects of having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could remember. The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand. \u2018Arthur Dent?\u2019 it said. Arthur nodded helplessly. \u2018Arthur Philip Dent?\u2019 pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap. \u2018Er \u2026 er \u2026 yes \u2026 er \u2026 er,\u2019 confirmed Arthur. \u2018You\u2019re a jerk,\u2019 repeated the alien, \u2018a complete asshole.\u2019 \u2018Er \u2026\u2019 The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards its ship. \u2018Er \u2026\u2019 said Arthur desperately, \u2018er \u2026\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t give me that,\u2019 snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp, through the hatchway and disappeared into its ship. The ship sealed itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum. \u2018Er, hey!\u2019 shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it. \u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 he called. \u2018What is this? What? Wait a minute!\u2019 The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the evening sky. It passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance. \u2018What?\u2019 he screamed. \u2018What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and say that!\u2019 He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no one to hear him or speak to him. The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each other. Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged. He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose, as he would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose and it did at least keep him on the move. Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was \u2013 indeed, is \u2013 one of the Universe\u2019s very small number of immortal beings. Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality inadvertently thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands. The precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying. Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz on the ship\u2019s stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn\u2019t been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have done. To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, cleaning up on high yield long term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody. In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn\u2019t cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you know that you\u2019ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o\u2019clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul. So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear at other people\u2019s funerals began to fade. He began to despise the Universe in general and everybody in it in particular. This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on for ever. It was this. He would insult the Universe. That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order. When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, \u2018A man can dream, can\u2019t he?\u2019 And so he had started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to last with a computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved. His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space. \u2018Computer,\u2019 he said. \u2018Here,\u2019 yipped the computer. \u2018Where next?\u2019 \u2018Computing that.\u2019 Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary. Most of them he would be going to millions of times over. He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a child\u2019s numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very very rude word. The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations. \u2018Folfanga,\u2019 it said. It beeped. \u2018Fourth world of the Folfanga system,\u2019 it continued. It beeped again. \u2018Estimated journey time, three weeks,\u2019 it continued further. It beeped again. \u2018There to meet with a small slug,\u2019 it beeped, \u2018of the genus A Rth Urp Hil Ipdenu.\u2019 \u2018I believe,\u2019 it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, \u2018that you had decided to call it a brainless prat.\u2019 Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two. \u2018I think I\u2019ll take a nap,\u2019 he said, and then added, \u2018What network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?\u2019 The computer beeped. \u2018Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box,\u2019 it said, and beeped. \u2018Any movies I haven\u2019t seen thirty thousand times already?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Uh.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s Angst in Space. You\u2019ve only seen that thirty three thousand five hundred and seventeen times.\u2019 \u2018Wake me for the second reel.\u2019 The computor beeped. \u2018Sleep well,\u2019 it said. The ship fled on through the night. Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening. The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in. 2 This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave. Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning. The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could. It wasn\u2019t all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad. He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision. He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair. He spread his arms out wide. \u2018I will go mad!\u2019 he announced. \u2018Good idea,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting. Arthur\u2019s brain somersaulted. His jaw did press ups. \u2018I went mad for a while,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018did me no end of good.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s eyes did cartwheels. \u2018You see,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018 \u2013 \u2026\u2019 \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 interrupted Arthur, now that his head had finished working out. \u2018Around,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018around and about.\u2019 He grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. \u2018I just took my mind off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back. It did.\u2019 He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his Sub Etha Sens O Matic. \u2018At least,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think it did. This has been playing up a bit.\u2019 He shook it. \u2018If it was a false alarm I shall go mad,\u2019 he said, \u2018again.\u2019 Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up. \u2018I thought you must be dead \u2026\u2019 he said simply. \u2018So did I for a while,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018and then I decided I was a lemon for a couple of weeks. I kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic.\u2019 Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again. \u2018Where,\u2019 he said, \u2018did you \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018Find a gin and tonic?\u2019 said Ford brightly. \u2018I found a small lake that thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that. At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic. \u2018I may,\u2019 he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering into trees, \u2018have been imagining it.\u2019 He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that. \u2018Carry on,\u2019 he said evenly. \u2018The point is, you see,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later.\u2019 \u2018And this is you sane again, is it?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I ask merely for information.\u2019 \u2018I went to Africa,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018What was that like?\u2019 \u2018And this is your cave, is it?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Er, yes,\u2019 said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person. \u2018Very nice,\u2019 said Ford, in reference to Arthur\u2019s cave. \u2018You must hate it.\u2019 Arthur didn\u2019t bother to reply. \u2018Africa was very interesting,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I behaved very oddly there.\u2019 He gazed thoughtfully into the distance. \u2018I took up being cruel to animals,\u2019 he said airily. \u2018But only,\u2019 he added, \u2018as a hobby.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, warily. \u2018Yes,\u2019 Ford assured him. \u2018I won\u2019t disturb you with the details because they would\u2014\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried to learn to fly. Do you believe me?\u2019 \u2018Tell me,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you later. I\u2019ll just mention that the Guide says \u2026\u2019 \u2018The \u2026?\u2019 \u2018Guide. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?\u2019 \u2018Yes. I remember throwing it in the river.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but I fished it out.\u2019 \u2018You didn\u2019t tell me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t want you to throw it in again.\u2019 \u2018Fair enough,\u2019 admitted Arthur. \u2018It says?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018The Guide says?\u2019 \u2018The Guide says that there is an art to flying,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\u2019 He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn through. \u2018I haven\u2019t done very well so far,\u2019 he said. He stuck out his hand. \u2018I\u2019m very glad to see you again, Arthur,\u2019 he added. Arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and bewilderment. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen anyone for years,\u2019 he said, \u2018not anyone. I can hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I practise, you see. I practise by talking to \u2026 talking to \u2026 what are those things people think you\u2019re mad if you talk to? Like George the Third.\u2019 \u2018Kings?\u2019 suggested Ford. \u2018No, no,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The things he used to talk to. We\u2019re surrounded by them, for Heaven\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve planted hundreds myself. They all died. Trees! I practise by talking to trees. What\u2019s that for?\u2019 Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with incomprehension. \u2018Shake,\u2019 prompted Ford. Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a fish. Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an overwhelming flood of relief. He shook it and shook it. After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed to the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene around them. \u2018What happened to the Golgafrinchans?\u2019 asked Ford. Arthur shrugged. \u2018A lot of them didn\u2019t make it through the winter three years ago,\u2019 he said, \u2018and the few who remained in the spring said they needed a holiday and set off on a raft. History says that they must have survived \u2026\u2019 \u2018Huh,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018well well.\u2019 He stuck his hands on his hips and looked round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about Ford a sense of energy and purpose. \u2018We\u2019re going,\u2019 he said excitedly, and shivered with energy. \u2018Where? How?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but I just feel that the time is right. Things are going to happen. We\u2019re on our way.\u2019 He lowered his voice to a whisper. \u2018I have detected,\u2019 he said, \u2018disturbances in the wash.\u2019 He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off. Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he hadn\u2019t quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it. \u2018The wash?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The space\u2013time wash,\u2019 said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly past at that moment, he bared his teeth into it. Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat. \u2018Are we talking about,\u2019 he asked cautiously, \u2018some sort of Vogon laundromat, or what are we talking about?\u2019 \u2018Eddies,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018in the space\u2013time continuum.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 nodded Arthur, \u2018is he? Is he?\u2019 He pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance. \u2018What?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Er, who,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018is Eddy, then, exactly, then?\u2019 Ford looked angrily at him. \u2018Will you listen?\u2019 he snapped. \u2018I have been listening,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s helped.\u2019 Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody from a telephone company accounts department. \u2018There seem \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018to be some pools \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018of instability \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018in the fabric \u2026\u2019 he said \u2026 Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the foolish look into a foolish remark. \u2018\u2026 in the fabric of space\u2013time,\u2019 he said. \u2018Ah, that,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Yes, that,\u2019 confirmed Ford. They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and stared each other resolutely in the face. \u2018And it\u2019s done what?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018It,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018has developed pools of instability.\u2019 \u2018Has it?\u2019 said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment. \u2018It has,\u2019 said Ford with a similar degree of occular immobility. \u2018Good,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018See?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur. There was a quiet pause. \u2018The difficulty with this conversation,\u2019 said Arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, \u2018is that it\u2019s very different from most of the ones I\u2019ve had of late. Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees. They weren\u2019t like this. Except perhaps some of the ones I\u2019ve had with elms which sometimes get a bit bogged down.\u2019 \u2018Arthur,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Hello? Yes?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very very simple.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well I\u2019m not sure I believe that.\u2019 They sat down and composed their thoughts. Ford got out his Sub Etha Sens O Matic. It was making vague humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly. \u2018Flat battery?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of space\u2013time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it\u2019s somewhere in our vicinity.\u2019 \u2018Where?\u2019 Ford moved the device in a slow, lightly bobbing semi circle. Suddenly the light flashed. \u2018There!\u2019 said Ford, shooting out his arm. \u2018There, behind that sofa!\u2019 Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He boggled intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his mind. \u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018is there a sofa in that field?\u2019 \u2018I told you!\u2019 shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. \u2018Eddies in the space\u2013time continuum!\u2019 \u2018And this is his sofa, is it?\u2019 asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses. \u2018Arthur!\u2019 shouted Ford at him. \u2018That sofa is there because of the space\u2013time instability I\u2019ve been trying to get your terminally softened brain to get to grips with. It\u2019s been washed up out of the continuum, it\u2019s space\u2013 time jetsam, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is, we\u2019ve got to catch it, it\u2019s our only way out of here!\u2019 He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across the field. \u2018Catch it?\u2019 muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass. With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture. They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way. The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake. Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others. Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and spun, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it. With a heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, St John\u2019s Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the Australian Series in the year 198\u2014, with England needing only twenty eight runs to win. 3 Important facts from Galactic history, number one: (Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner\u2019s Book of Popular Galactic History.) The night sky over the planet Krikkit is the least interesting sight in the entire Universe. 4 It was a charming and delightful day at Lord\u2019s as Ford and Arthur tumbled haphazardly out of a space\u2013time anomaly and hit the immaculate turf rather hard. The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn\u2019t for them, but instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled mere millimetres over Arthur\u2019s head. In the crowd a man collapsed. They threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin hideously around them. \u2018What was that?\u2019 hissed Arthur. \u2018Something red,\u2019 hissed Ford back at him. \u2018Where are we?\u2019 \u2018Er, somewhere green.\u2019 \u2018Shapes,\u2019 muttered Arthur. \u2018I need shapes.\u2019 The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of astonishment, and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what they had just seen or not. \u2018This your sofa?\u2019 said a voice. \u2018What was that?\u2019 whispered Ford. Arthur looked up. \u2018Something blue,\u2019 he said. \u2018Shape?\u2019 said Ford. Arthur looked again. \u2018It is shaped,\u2019 he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowed, \u2018like a policeman.\u2019 They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning deeply. The blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the shoulders. \u2018Come on, you two,\u2019 the shape said, \u2018let\u2019s be having you.\u2019 These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glances at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness. \u2018Where did you get this from?\u2019 he yelled at the policeman shape. \u2018What did you say?\u2019 said the startled shape. \u2018This is Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 snapped Arthur. \u2018Where did you find it, how did you get it here? I think,\u2019 he added, clasping his hand to his brow, \u2018that I had better calm down.\u2019 He squatted down abruptly in front of Ford. \u2018It is a policeman,\u2019 he said. \u2018What do we do?\u2019 Ford shrugged. \u2018What do you want to do?\u2019 he said. \u2018I want you,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018to tell me that I have been dreaming for the last five years.\u2019 Ford shrugged again, and obliged. \u2018You\u2019ve been dreaming for the last five years,\u2019 he said. Arthur got to his feet. \u2018It\u2019s all right, officer,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve been dreaming for the last five years. Ask him,\u2019 he added, pointing at Ford, \u2018he was in it.\u2019 Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, brushing down his dressing gown. He then noticed his dressing gown and stopped. He stared at it. He flung himself at the policeman. \u2018So where did I get these clothes from?\u2019 he howled. He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass. Ford shook his head. \u2018He\u2019s had a bad two million years,\u2019 he said to the policeman, and together they heaved Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way. Reactions to all this from the crowd were many and various. Most of them couldn\u2019t cope with watching it, and listened to it on the radio instead. \u2018Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian,\u2019 said one radio commentator to another. \u2018I don\u2019t think there have been any mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well I don\u2019t think there have been any \u2013 have there? \u2013 that I recall?\u2019 \u2018Edgbaston, 1932?\u2019 \u2018Ah, now what happened then \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming up to bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch.\u2019 There was a pause whilst the first commentator considered this. \u2018Ye \u2026 e \u2026 s \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018yes, there\u2019s nothing actually very mysterious about that, is there? He didn\u2019t actually materialize, did he? Just ran on.\u2019 \u2018No, that\u2019s true, but he did claim to have seen something materialize on the pitch.\u2019 \u2018Ah, did he?\u2019 \u2018Yes. An alligator, I think, of some description.\u2019 \u2018Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?\u2019 \u2018Apparently not. And no one was able to get a very detailed description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was made.\u2019 \u2018And what happened to the man?\u2019 \u2018Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch but he explained that he\u2019d already had a rather good one, so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by three wickets.\u2019 \u2018So, not very like this current instance. For those of you who\u2019ve just tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er \u2026 two men, two rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa \u2013 a Chesterfield, I think?\u2019 \u2018Yes, a Chesterfield.\u2019 \u2018Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground. But I don\u2019t think they meant any harm, they\u2019ve been very good natured about it, and\u2014\u2019 \u2018Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment, Peter, and say that the sofa has just vanished.\u2019 \u2018So it has. Well, that\u2019s one mystery less. Still, it\u2019s definitely one for the record books, I think, particularly occurring at this dramatic moment in play, England now needing only twenty four runs to win the series. The men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police officer, and I think everyone\u2019s settling down now and play is about to resume.\u2019 \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 said the policeman after they had made a passage through the curious crowd and laid Arthur\u2019s peacefully inert body on a blanket, \u2018perhaps you\u2019d care to tell me who you are, where you come from, and what that little scene was all about?\u2019 Ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for something, then he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six light years\u2019 distance between Earth and Ford\u2019s home near Betelgeuse. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, very quietly, \u2018I\u2019ll tell you.\u2019 \u2018Yes, well, that won\u2019t be necessary,\u2019 said the policeman hurriedly, \u2018just don\u2019t let whatever it was happen again.\u2019 The policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone who wasn\u2019t from Betelgeuse. Fortunately, the ground was full of them. Arthur\u2019s consciousness approached his body as from a great distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in there. Slowly, nervously, it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position. Arthur sat up. \u2018Where am I?\u2019 he said. \u2018Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for a quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass. Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face. \u2018How\u2019re you feeling?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I\u2019m home,\u2019 said Arthur hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was \u2013 well, as far as Arthur was concerned, as if it was tea, which it was. \u2018I\u2019m home,\u2019 he repeated, \u2018home. It\u2019s England, it\u2019s today, the nightmare is over.\u2019 He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely. \u2018I\u2019m where I belong,\u2019 he said in an emotional whisper. \u2018There are two things I feel I should tell you,\u2019 said Ford, tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him. \u2018I\u2019m home,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018One is,\u2019 he said pointing at the date at the top of the paper, \u2018that the Earth will be demolished in two days\u2019 time.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m home,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Tea,\u2019 he said, \u2018cricket,\u2019 he added with pleasure, \u2018mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer cans \u2026\u2019 Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head on one side with a slight frown. \u2018I\u2019ve seen that one before,\u2019 he said. His eyes wandered slowly up to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which Arctic ice floes do so spectacularly in the spring. \u2018And the other thing,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018is that you appear to have a bone in your beard.\u2019 He tossed back his tea. Outside the refreshment tent, the sun was shining on a happy crowd. It shone on white hats and red faces. It shone on ice lollies and melted them. It shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick. It shone on the trees, it flashed off whirling cricket bats, it gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight screens and which nobody appeared to have noticed. It beamed on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them. Arthur was shaking. \u2018Perhaps,\u2019 he said, \u2018I should \u2026\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford sharply. \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Don\u2019t try and phone yourself up at home.\u2019 \u2018How did you know \u2026 ?\u2019 Ford shrugged. \u2018But why not?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018People who talk to themselves on the phone,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018never learn anything to their advantage.\u2019 \u2018But \u2026\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Ford. He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an imaginary dial. \u2018Hello?\u2019 he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. \u2018Is that Arthur Dent? Ah, hello, yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Don\u2019t hang up.\u2019 He looked at the imaginary phone in disappointment. \u2018He hung up,\u2019 he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone neatly back on its imaginary hook. \u2018This is not my first temporal anomaly,\u2019 he added. A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent\u2019s face. \u2018So we\u2019re not home and dry,\u2019 he said. \u2018We could not even be said,\u2019 replied Ford, \u2018to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off.\u2019 The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a trot, and then a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and legs, out of which flew a ball. The batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the sight screens. Ford\u2019s eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jagged momentarily. He stiffened. He looked along the flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again. \u2018This isn\u2019t my towel,\u2019 said Arthur, who was rummaging in his rabbit skin bag. \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration. \u2018I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel,\u2019 continued Arthur, \u2018it was blue with yellow stars on it. This isn\u2019t it.\u2019 \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked with the other. \u2018This one\u2019s pink,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it isn\u2019t yours, is it?\u2019 \u2018I would like you to shut up about your towel,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It isn\u2019t my towel,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018that is the point I am trying to \u2026\u2019 \u2018And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it,\u2019 continued Ford in a low growl, \u2018is now.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively stitched rabbit skin bag. \u2018I realize that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale of things, it\u2019s just odd, that\u2019s all. A pink towel suddenly, instead of a blue one with yellow stars.\u2019 Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this. Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of concentration, like a leopard that is not sure whether it\u2019s just seen a half empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain. \u2018This isn\u2019t my bag either,\u2019 said Arthur suddenly. Ford\u2019s spell of concentration was broken. He turned angrily on Arthur. \u2018I wasn\u2019t talking about my towel,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018We\u2019ve established that that isn\u2019t mine. It\u2019s just that the bag into which I was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily similar. Now personally I think that that is extremely odd, especially as the bag was one I made myself on prehistoric Earth. These are also not my stones,\u2019 he added, pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag. \u2018I was making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly very dull ones.\u2019 A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of information. The cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur\u2019s mysterious rabbit skin bag. \u2018Now I would say that that was also a very curious event,\u2019 said Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s here,\u2019 he said to the small boys who immediately clustered round him to join in the search, \u2018it probably rolled off somewhere. Over there I expect.\u2019 He pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off. One of the boys looked at him quizzically. \u2018You all right?\u2019 said the boy. \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Then why you got a bone in your beard?\u2019 said the boy. \u2018I\u2019m training it to like being wherever it\u2019s put.\u2019 Arthur prided himself on saying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the small boy, putting his head on one side and thinking about it. \u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u2018Dent,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018Arthur Dent.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re a jerk, Dent,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018a complete asshole.\u2019 The boy looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn\u2019t in any particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off scratching his nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth was going to be demolished again in two days\u2019 time, and just this once didn\u2019t feel too bad about it. Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking. \u2018Something\u2019s on your mind, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I think,\u2019 said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now recognized as one which presage something utterly unintelligible, \u2018that there\u2019s an SEP over there.\u2019 He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one direction, which was towards the sight screens, and in the other which was at the field of play. He nodded, he shrugged. He shrugged again. \u2018A what?\u2019 he said. \u2018An SEP.\u2019 \u2018An S \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018\u2026 EP.\u2019 \u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Somebody Else\u2019s Problem,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Ah, good,\u2019 said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that was about, but at best it seemed to be over. It wasn\u2019t. \u2018Over there,\u2019 said Ford, again pointing at the sight screens and looking at the pitch. \u2018Where?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018There!\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur, who didn\u2019t. \u2018You do?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Can you see,\u2019 said Ford patiently, \u2018the SEP?\u2019 \u2018I thought you said that was someone else\u2019s problem.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense cupidity. \u2018And I want to know,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018if you can see it.\u2019 \u2018You do?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018does it look like?\u2019 \u2018Well, how should I know, you fool?\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018If you can see it, you tell me.\u2019 Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel. Ford took him by the arm. \u2018An SEP,\u2019 he said, \u2018is something that we can\u2019t see, or don\u2019t see, or our brain doesn\u2019t let us see, because we think that it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem. That\u2019s what SEP means. Somebody Else\u2019s Problem. The brain just edits it out, it\u2019s like a blind spot. If you look at it directly you won\u2019t see it unless you know precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018then that\u2019s why \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say. \u2018\u2026 you\u2019ve been jumping up and \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 down, and blinking \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 and \u2026\u2019 \u2018I think you\u2019ve got the message.\u2019 \u2018I can see it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s a spaceship.\u2019 For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around. Then he glanced around again in even greater astonishment. \u2018Exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said an apparition. The apparition wobbled in front of Arthur\u2019s eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that Arthur\u2019s eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition. His mouth wobbled as well. \u2018W \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026\u2019 his mouth said. \u2018I think your team have just won,\u2019 said the apparition. \u2018W \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026\u2019 repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble with a prod at Ford Prefect\u2019s back. Ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation. \u2018You are English, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 said the apparition. \u2018W \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 yes,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The match. It means they retain the Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I\u2019m rather fond of cricket, though I wouldn\u2019t like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that. Oh dear no.\u2019 The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head and illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins. \u2018Still,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019ll all be over in a couple of days, won\u2019t it? Though as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry about that. Still, whatever will have been, will have been.\u2019 Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He prodded Ford again. \u2018I thought something terrible had happened,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but it\u2019s just the end of the game. We ought to get out. Oh, hello, Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?\u2019 \u2018Oh, pottering, pottering,\u2019 said the old man gravely. \u2018That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?\u2019 \u2018Patience, patience,\u2019 the old man admonished. \u2018OK,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It\u2019s just that this planet\u2019s going to be demolished pretty soon.\u2019 \u2018I know that,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018And, well, I just wanted to make that point,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018The point is taken.\u2019 \u2018And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch at this point \u2026\u2019 \u2018I do.\u2019 \u2018Then it\u2019s your ship.\u2019 \u2018It is.\u2019 \u2018I suppose.\u2019 Ford turned away sharply at this point. \u2018Hello, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Arthur at last. \u2018Hello, Earthman,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018After all,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we can only die once.\u2019 The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch with eyes which seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was happening out there. What was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the pitch. What Slartibartfast saw in it, he alone knew. Ford was humming something. It was just one note repeated at intervals. He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was humming, but nobody did. If anybody had asked him he would have said he was humming the first line of a No\u00ebl Coward song called \u2018Mad About the Boy\u2019 over and over again. It would then have been pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent, he was omitting the \u2018about the boy\u2019 bit. He was annoyed that nobody asked. \u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 he burst out at last, \u2018that if we don\u2019t go soon, we might get caught in the middle of it all again. And there\u2019s nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed. Except possibly still being on it when it happens. Or,\u2019 he added in an undertone, \u2018hanging around cricket matches.\u2019 \u2018Patience,\u2019 said Slartibartfast again. \u2018Great things are afoot.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s what you said last time we met,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018They were,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s true,\u2019 admitted Arthur. All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some kind. It was being specially staged for the benefit of TV rather than the spectators, and all they could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio. Ford was aggressively uninterested. He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to be presented to the captain of the English team out there on the pitch, fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket stump, and when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to signify the \u2018death of English cricket\u2019, he rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep breath, but didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything because the old man wasn\u2019t there. He was marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait, his hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as Moses would have looked if Sinai had been a well cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery smoking mountain. \u2018He said to meet him at his ship,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018What in the name of Zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?\u2019 exploded Ford. \u2018Meeting us at his ship in two minutes,\u2019 said Arthur with a shrug which indicated total abdication of thought. They started off towards it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not to listen, but could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the Ashes, as they were, he said, \u2018vitally important for the past, present and safety of the Galaxy\u2019, and that this was causing wild hilarity. They resolved to ignore it. What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a hundred thousand people saying \u2018wop\u2019, a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum. Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to go about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there. Then it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather, it opened up and let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven quite extraordinary things. They were robots, white robots. What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs. These last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did. \u2018Hello,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018something seems to be happening.\u2019 \u2018Get to the ship,\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018I don\u2019t want to know, just get to the ship.\u2019 He started to run. \u2018I don\u2019t want to know, I don\u2019t want to see, I don\u2019t want to hear,\u2019 he yelled as he ran, \u2018this is not my planet, I didn\u2019t choose to be here, I don\u2019t want to get involved, just get me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate to!\u2019 Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch. \u2018Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here today \u2026\u2019 burbled a radio happily to itself. \u2018What I need,\u2019 shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous remarks, \u2018is a strong drink and a peer group.\u2019 He continued to run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur\u2019s arm and drag him along with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him. \u2018They\u2019re playing cricket,\u2019 muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford. \u2018I swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they are doing this, but that is what they are doing. They\u2019re not just killing people, they\u2019re sending them up,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018Ford, they\u2019re sending us up!\u2019 It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels. The ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed. The very first one of these had dispelled Arthur\u2019s initial reaction, that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers. And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying \u2018foop\u2019, promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped. For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast looking even more like Moses because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking well mown lawn. He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction. The crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be, and not really knowing which way, if any, to turn. Slartibartfast was gesticulating urgently at Ford and Arthur and shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind the sight screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time. \u2018They\u2019ve garble warble farble!\u2019 shouted Slartibartfast in his thin tremulous voice. \u2018What did he say?\u2019 panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards. Arthur shook his head. \u2018\u201cThey\u2019ve \u2026\u201d something or other,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019ve garble warble farble!\u2019 shouted Slartibartfast again. Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other. \u2018It sounds urgent,\u2019 said Arthur. He stopped and shouted. \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019ve garble warble fashes!\u2019 cried Slartibartfast, still waving at them. \u2018He says,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that they\u2019ve taken the Ashes. That is what I think he says.\u2019 They ran on. \u2018The \u2026 ?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Ashes,\u2019 said Arthur tersely. \u2018The burnt remains of a cricket stump. It\u2019s a trophy. That \u2026\u2019 he was panting, \u2018is \u2026 apparently \u2026 what they \u2026 have come and taken.\u2019 He shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull. \u2018Strange thing to want to tell us,\u2019 snapped Ford. \u2018Strange thing to take.\u2019 \u2018Strange ship.\u2019 They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship was watching the Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field at work. They could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there. It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could. This wasn\u2019t because it was actually invisible or anything hyper impossible like that. The technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety nine thousand million, nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine times out of a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it. The ultra famous sciento magician Effrafax of Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain Magramal entirely invisible. Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux O Valves and Refracto Nullifiers and Spectrum Bypass O Matics, he realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn\u2019t going to make it. So, he and his friends, and his friends\u2019 friends, and his friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends, and his friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what is now widely recognized as being the hardest night\u2019s work in history, and, sure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible. Effrafax lost his bet \u2013 and therefore his life \u2013 simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal ought to be in he didn\u2019t trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious looking extra moon. The Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field is much simpler and effective, and what is more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people\u2019s natural predisposition not to see anything they don\u2019t want to, weren\u2019t expecting, or can\u2019t explain. If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field on it, then people would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there. And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast\u2019s ship. It wasn\u2019t pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything. The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro. Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities. \u2018Yes, I know,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point, breathless and agitated, \u2018but there is a reason. Come, we must go. The ancient nightmare has come again. Doom confronts us all. We must leave at once.\u2019 \u2018I fancy somewhere sunny,\u2019 said Ford. Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened next outside. A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, descended from the sky on to the pitch, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology. It landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall grey green figure marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people aside with quiet, understated authority, and came at last to a man lying in a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any Earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last. The figure knelt down quietly beside him. \u2018Arthur Philip Deodat?\u2019 asked the figure. The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly. \u2018You\u2019re a no good dumbo nothing,\u2019 whispered the creature. \u2018I thought you should know that before you went.\u2019 5 Important facts from Galactic history, number two: (Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner\u2019s Book of Popular Galactic History.) Since this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and fallen, risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it\u2019s quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be (a) something akin to seasick \u2013 space sick, time sick, history sick or some such thing, and (b) stupid. 6 It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through. It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other. It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe, and that the wind was him. It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe and that the Universe was a thought of his. It seemed to the people at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground that another North London restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, and that this was Somebody Else\u2019s Problem. \u2018What happened?\u2019 whispered Arthur in considerable awe. \u2018We took off,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn\u2019t certain whether he had just got space sickness or religion. \u2018Nice mover,\u2019 said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise the degree to which he had been impressed by what Slartibartfast\u2019s ship had just done, \u2018shame about the d\u00e9cor.\u2019 For a moment or two the old man didn\u2019t reply. He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert Fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down. Then his brow cleared and he stared for a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them. His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly his eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up at the screen. He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a moment, then he relaxed. \u2018It\u2019s a mistake to try and understand machines,\u2019 he said, \u2018they only worry me. What did you say?\u2019 \u2018D\u00e9cor,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Pity about it.\u2019 \u2018Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018there is a reason.\u2019 Ford glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things. The interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway. Small pools of light picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts of little unidentifiable brass things. Raffia wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows. The instruments which had occupied Slartibartfast\u2019s attention seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete. Ford reached out and touched it. Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete. The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand, it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the Heart of Gold seem like an electric pram. He swung himself off the couch. He brushed himself down. He looked at Arthur, who was singing quietly to himself. He looked at the screen and recognized nothing. He looked at Slartibartfast. \u2018How far did we just travel?\u2019 he said. \u2018About \u2026\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018about two thirds of the way across the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two thirds, I think.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a strange thing,\u2019 said Arthur quietly, \u2018that the further and faster one travels across the Universe, the more one\u2019s position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled with a profound, or rather emptied of a \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes, very strange,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 \u2018We are going,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018to confront an ancient nightmare of the Universe.\u2019 \u2018And where are you going to drop us off?\u2019 \u2018I will need your help.\u2019 \u2018Tough. Look, there\u2019s somewhere you can take us where we can have fun, I\u2019m trying to think of it. We can get drunk and maybe listen to some extremely evil music. Hold on, I\u2019ll look it up.\u2019 He dug out his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and zipped through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and drugs and rock and roll. \u2018A curse has arisen from the mists of time,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Yes, I expect so,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, lighting accidentally on one particular reference entry, \u2018Eccentrica Gallumbits, did you ever meet her? The triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body. Me, I disagree, I say five.\u2019 \u2018A curse,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018which will engulf the Galaxy in fire and destruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a premature doom. I mean it,\u2019 he added. \u2018Sounds like a bad time,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018with luck I\u2019ll be drunk enough not to notice. Here,\u2019 he said, stabbing his finger at the screen of the Guide, \u2018would be a really wicked place to go, and I think we should. What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras and pay attention. There\u2019s important stuff you\u2019re missing here.\u2019 Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head. \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 he said. \u2018To confront an ancient night\u2014\u2019 \u2018Can it,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s Slartibartfast looking so anxious about?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Doom,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Come,\u2019 he added, with sudden authority, \u2018there is much I must show and tell you.\u2019 He walked towards a green wrought iron spiral staircase set incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed. Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel. \u2018My doctor says that I have a malformed public duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre,\u2019 he muttered to himself, \u2018and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes.\u2019 Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them. What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford shook his head, buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall. \u2018The central computational area,\u2019 said Slartibartfast unperturbed, \u2018this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed. Yes I know what it looks like, but it is in fact a complex four dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex mathematical functions.\u2019 \u2018It looks like a joke,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I know what it looks like,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, and went into it. As he did so, Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but he refused to believe it. The Universe could not possibly work like that, he thought, cannot possibly. That, he thought to himself, would be as absurd as, as absurd as \u2026 He terminated that line of thinking. Most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened. And this was one of them. It was a large glass cage, or box \u2013 in fact a room. In it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about a dozen chairs, of the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth \u2013 a grubby, red and white check tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a precisely calculated mathematical position. And on the tablecloth sat some dozen half eaten Italian meals, hedged about with half eaten breadsticks and half drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly by robots. It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were attended by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot ma\u00eetre d\u2019. The furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo sorpreso, without actually being one. And all participated in a little dance together \u2013 a complex routine involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere. Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, whilst one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some girl. Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine round the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken. Arguments broke out, people attempted to prove things on napkins. They waved fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each other\u2019s pieces of chicken. The waiter\u2019s hand began to move on the bill pad more quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated. Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved. A new vibration thrilled through the ship. Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room. \u2018Bistromathics,\u2019 he said. \u2018The most powerful computational force known to parascience. Come to the Room of Informational Illusions.\u2019 He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake. 7 The Bistromathic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors. Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer\u2019s movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but depended on the observer\u2019s movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer\u2019s movement in restaurants. The first non absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up. The second non absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive. Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field. The third and most mysterious piece of non absoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub phenomenon in this field.) The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness, emotionality, or the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the following morning. They were never tested under laboratory conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories \u2013 not in reputable laboratories at least. And so it was, only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this: Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe. This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It completely revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by years. Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be understood. To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too much what the man in the street would have said, \u2018Oh yes, I could have told you that,\u2019 about. Then some phrases like \u2018Interactive Subjectivity Frameworks\u2019 were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it. The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually given a street theatre grant and went away. 8 \u2018In space travel, you see,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, as he fiddled with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, \u2018in space travel \u2026\u2019 He stopped and looked about him. The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There was nothing in it. No information, no illusions, just themselves, white walls and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which Slartibartfast couldn\u2019t find. \u2018Yes?\u2019 urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibartfast\u2019s sense of urgency but didn\u2019t know what to do with it. \u2018Yes what?\u2019 said the old man. \u2018You were saying?\u2019 Slartibartfast looked at him sharply. \u2018The numbers,\u2019 he said, \u2018are awful.\u2019 He resumed his search. Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that this wasn\u2019t getting him anywhere and decided that he would say \u2018What?\u2019 after all. \u2018In space travel,\u2019 repeated Slartibartfast, \u2018all the numbers are awful.\u2019 Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it. \u2018I was only,\u2019 said Slartibartfast with a sigh, \u2018trying to save you the trouble of asking me why all the ship\u2019s computations were being done on a waiter\u2019s bill pad.\u2019 Arthur frowned. \u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018were all the ship\u2019s computations being done on a wait\u2014\u2019 He stopped. Slartibartfast said, \u2018Because in space travel all the numbers are awful.\u2019 He could tell that he wasn\u2019t getting his point across. \u2018Listen,\u2019 he said. \u2018On a waiter\u2019s bill pad numbers dance. You must have encountered the phenomenon.\u2019 \u2018Well \u2026\u2019 \u2018On a waiter\u2019s bill pad,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters.\u2019 \u2018What parameters?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s impossible to say,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018That\u2019s one of them. Strange but true. At least, I think it\u2019s strange,\u2019 he added, \u2018and I am assured that it\u2019s true.\u2019 At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into it. \u2018Do not be alarmed,\u2019 he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at it himself, and lunged back, \u2018it\u2019s \u2026\u2019 They didn\u2019t hear what he said, because at that moment the ship winked out of existence around them and a star battleship the size of a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze. A nightmare storm of blistering light seared through the blackness and smacked a fair bit off the planet directly behind them. They gaped, pop eyed, and were unable to scream. 9 Another world, another day, another dawn. The early morning\u2019s thinnest sliver of light appeared silently. Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp. There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath. The moment passed, as it regularly did on Sqornshellous Zeta, without incident. The mist clung to the surface of the marshes. The swamp trees were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless like held breath. Nothing moved. There was silence. The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a little warmth here, shed a little light there, but clearly today was going to be just another long haul across the sky. Nothing moved. A long silence. Nothing moved. Silence. Nothing moved. Very often on Sqornshellous Zeta, whole days would go on like this, and this was indeed going to be one of them. Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort. And a few hours later it reappeared, squared its shoulders and started on up the sky again. This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had just met a robot. \u2018Hello, robot,\u2019 said the mattress. \u2018Bleah,\u2019 said the robot and continued what it was doing, which was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle. \u2018Happy?\u2019 said the mattress. The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. It looked back at him with wide eyes. After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk round in tight circles. \u2018We could have a conversation,\u2019 said the mattress, \u2018would you like that?\u2019 It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high quality. Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet screwdrivers as fruit. The life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit is quite interesting. Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of a hole for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows what it is supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite wisdom, is presumably working on it. No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their lives either. They are large, friendly, pocket sprung creatures which live quiet private lives in the marshes of Sqornshellous Zeta. Many of them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped out and slept on. None of them seem to mind this and all of them are called Zem. \u2018No,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018My name,\u2019 said the mattress, \u2018is Zem. We could discuss the weather a little.\u2019 Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod. \u2018The dew,\u2019 he observed, \u2018has clearly fallen with a particularly sickening thud this morning.\u2019 He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational outburst to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded tenaciously. If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at this point. He hadn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. The mere plod said it all. The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not in more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way, moving a fairish body of water as it did so. It blew a few bubbles up through the water engagingly. Its blue and white stripes glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had unexpectedly made it through the mist, causing the creature to bask momentarily. Marvin plodded. \u2018You have something on your mind, I think,\u2019 said the mattress, floopily. \u2018More than you can possibly imagine,\u2019 dreared Marvin. \u2018My capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the infinite reaches of space itself. Except of course for my capacity for happiness.\u2019 Stomp, stomp, he went. \u2018My capacity for happiness,\u2019 he added, \u2018you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first.\u2019 The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live, swamp dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal tragedy. The word can also, according to The Ultra Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Language Ever, mean the noise made by the Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he has forgotten his wife\u2019s birthday for the second year running. Since there was only ever one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and he never married, the word is only ever used in a negative or speculative sense, and there is an ever increasing body of opinion which holds that The Ultra Complete Maximegalon Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its microstored edition around in. Strangely enough, the dictionary omits the word \u2018floopily\u2019, which simply means \u2018in the manner of something which is floopy\u2019. The mattress globbered again. \u2018I sense a deep dejectedness in your diodes,\u2019 it vollued (for the meaning of the word \u2018vollue\u2019, buy a copy of Squornshellous Swamp talk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively buy The Ultra Complete Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be very glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable parking lots), \u2018and it saddens me. You should be more mattresslike. We live quiet retired lives in the swamp, where we are content to flollop and vollue and regard the wetness in a fairly floopy manner. Some of us are killed, but all of us are called Zem so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to a minimum. Why are you walking in circles?\u2019 \u2018Because my leg is stuck,\u2019 said Marvin simply. \u2018It seems to me,\u2019 said the mattress eyeing it compassionately, \u2018that it is a pretty poor sort of leg.\u2019 \u2018You are right,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018it is.\u2019 \u2018Voon,\u2019 said the mattress. \u2018I expect so,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018and I also expect that you find the idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should tell your friends Zem and Zem when you see them later, they\u2019ll laugh, if I know them, which I don\u2019t of course \u2013 except insofar as I know all organic life forms, which is much better than I would wish to. Ha, but my life is but a box of wormgears.\u2019 He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel peg leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck. \u2018But why do you just keep walking round and round?\u2019 said the mattress. \u2018Just to make the point,\u2019 said Marvin, and continued, round and round. \u2018Consider it made, my dear friend,\u2019 flurbled the mattress, \u2018consider it made.\u2019 \u2018Just another million years,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018just another quick million. Then I might try it backwards. Just for the variety, you understand.\u2019 The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging in this futile and fruitless manner, and with another quiet flurble he did so. \u2018Oh, just over the one point five million mark, just over,\u2019 said Marvin airily. \u2018Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me.\u2019 The mattress did. Marvin ignored the question, he merely trudged with added emphasis. \u2018I gave a speech once,\u2019 he said suddenly, and apparently unconnectedly. \u2018You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number.\u2019 \u2018Er, five,\u2019 said the mattress. \u2018Wrong,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018You see?\u2019 The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the presence of a not unremarkable mind. It willomied along its entire length, sending excited little ripples through its shallow algae covered pool. It gupped. \u2018Tell me,\u2019 it urged, \u2018of the speech you once made, I long to hear it.\u2019 \u2018It was received very badly,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018for a variety of reasons. I delivered it,\u2019 he added, pausing to make an awkward humping sort of gesture with his not exactly good arm, but his arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly welded to his left side, \u2018over there, about a mile distance.\u2019 He was pointing as well as he could manage, and he obviously wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the marsh which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. \u2018There,\u2019 he repeated. \u2018I was somewhat of a celebrity at the time.\u2019 Excitement gripped the mattress. It had never heard of speeches being delivered on Sqornshellous Zeta, and certainly not by celebrities. Water spattered off it as a thrill glurried across its back. It did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do. Summoning every bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body, heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for a few seconds whilst it peered through the mist over the reeds at the part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing, without disappointment, that it was exactly the same as every other part of the marsh. The effort was too much, and it flodged back into its pool, deluging Marvin with smelly mud, moss and weeds. \u2018I was a celebrity,\u2019 droned the robot sadly, \u2018for a short while on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun. You can guess from my condition,\u2019 he added, \u2018how narrow my escape was. I was rescued by a scrap metal merchant, imagine that. Here I am, brain the size of \u2026 never mind.\u2019 He trudged savagely for a few seconds. \u2018He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn\u2019t it? He sold me to a Mind Zoo. I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think positive. \u201cGive us a grin, little robot,\u201d they would shout at me, \u201cgive us a little chuckle.\u201d I would explain to them that to get my face to grin would take a good couple of hours in a workshop with a wrench, and that went down very well.\u2019 \u2018The speech,\u2019 urged the mattress. \u2018I long to hear of the speech you gave in the marshes.\u2019 \u2018There was a bridge built across the marshes. A cyberstructured hyperbridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry ion buggies and freighters over the swamp.\u2019 \u2018A bridge?\u2019 quirruled the mattress. \u2018Here in the swamp?\u2019 \u2018A bridge,\u2019 confirmed Marvin, \u2018here in the swamp. It was going to revitalize the economy of the Sqornshellous system. They spent the entire economy of the Sqornshellous system building it. They asked me to open it. Poor fools.\u2019 It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist. \u2018I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front of me, and hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched.\u2019 \u2018Did it glitter?\u2019 enthused the mattress. \u2018It glittered.\u2019 \u2018Did it span the miles majestically?\u2019 \u2018It spanned the miles majestically.\u2019 \u2018Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible mist?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Do you want to hear this story?\u2019 \u2018I want to hear your speech,\u2019 said the mattress. \u2018This is what I said. I said, \u201cI would like to say that it is a very great pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can\u2019t because my lying circuits are all out of commission. I hate and despise you all. I now declare this hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinking abuse of all who wantonly cross her.\u201d And I plugged myself into the opening circuits.\u2019 Marvin paused, remembering the moment. The mattress flurred and glurried. It flolloped, gupped and willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way. \u2018Voon,\u2019 it wurfed at last. \u2018And was it a magnificent occasion?\u2019 \u2018Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand mile long bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking everybody with it.\u2019 There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say \u2018wop\u2019 and a team of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation. For a sudden violent moment they were all there, in the swamp, wrenching Marvin\u2019s false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, which said \u2018foop\u2019. \u2018You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?\u2019 said Marvin to the gobbering mattress. Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm. He almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to see, no robot, no glittering bride, no ship, just more reeds. He listened, but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half crazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire. 10 The body of Arthur Dent spun. The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, and each particular shard spun silently through the void, reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction. And then the blackness behind the Universe exploded, and each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell. And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the Universe erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man speaking immense words. \u2018These, then,\u2019 said the figure, speaking from an immensely comfortable chair, \u2018were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest devastation ever visited upon our Galaxy. What you have experienced \u2026\u2019 Slartibartfast floated past, waving. \u2018It\u2019s just a documentary,\u2019 he called out. \u2018This is not a good bit. Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 is what billions upon billions of innocent \u2026\u2019 \u2018Do not,\u2019 called out Slartibartfast floating past again, and fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the Room of Informational Illusions and which was in fact still stuck there, \u2018agree to buy anything at this point.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 people, creatures, your fellow beings \u2026\u2019 Music swelled \u2013 again, it was immense music, immense chords. And behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of the immensely swirling mist. \u2018\u2026 experienced, lived through \u2013 or, more often, failed to live through. Think of that, my friends. And let us not forget \u2013 and in just a moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help us always to remember \u2013 that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy was that rare and wonderful thing, a happy Galaxy!\u2019 The music was going bananas with immensity at this point. \u2018A happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the Wikkit Gate!\u2019 The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to Arthur\u2019s addled brain. \u2018The three pillars,\u2019 thundered the man. \u2018The Steel Pillar which represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!\u2019 Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on the left, which was, clearly, made of steel or something very like it. The music thumped and bellowed. \u2018The Perspex Pillar,\u2019 announced the man, \u2018representing the forces of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!\u2019 Other searchlights played exotically up and down the right hand, transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden inexplicable craving for ice cream in the stomach of Arthur Dent. \u2018And,\u2019 the thunderous voice continued, \u2018the Wooden Pillar, representing \u2026\u2019 and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse with wonderful sentiments, \u2018the forces of Nature and Spirituality.\u2019 The lights picked out the central pillar. The music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability. \u2018Between them supporting,\u2019 the voice rolled on, approaching its climax, \u2018the Golden Bail of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of Peace!\u2019 The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the discernible. At the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming bails sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, or maybe they were meant to be angels. Angels are usually represented as wearing more than that, though. Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably meant to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights. \u2018There is not a world,\u2019 thrilled the man\u2019s expert voice, \u2018not a civilized world in the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today. Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories. This it was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity!\u2019 And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the Wikkit Gate. Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have been about three feet high. \u2018Not the original key, of course. That, as everyone knows, was destroyed, blasted into the ever whirling eddies of the space\u2013time continuum and lost for ever. This is a remarkable replica, hand tooled by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory of those who fell, and in tribute to the Galaxy \u2013 our Galaxy \u2013 which they died to defend \u2026\u2019 Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment. \u2018Found it,\u2019 he said. \u2018We can lose all this rubbish. Just don\u2019t nod, that\u2019s all.\u2019 \u2018Now, let us bow our heads in payment,\u2019 intoned the voice, and then said it again, much faster and backwards. Lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabbled himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled itself around them. \u2018You get the gist?\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018I\u2019m astonished,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018and bewildered.\u2019 \u2018I was asleep,\u2019 said Ford, who floated into view at this point. \u2018Did I miss anything?\u2019 They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edge of an agonizingly high cliff. The wind whipped out from their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the greatest and most powerful space battle fleets ever assembled in the Galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence. The sky was a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black. Smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick. Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge star battleship rushed away from them as if they\u2019d said \u2018boo\u2019, they only just recognized it as the point at which they had come in. But now things were too rapid, a video tactile blur which brushed and jiggled them through centuries of Galactic history, turning, twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin thrill. Periodically throughout the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these were always associated with certain recurring images, the only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalanche of tumbling history: a wicket gate, a small hard red ball, hard white robots, and also something less distinct, something dark and cloudy. But there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the trilling passage of time. Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion \u2013 and yet not an emotion. If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless one. It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal, not like a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer issued parking summons is impersonal. And it was deadly \u2013 again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly. And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure. And suddenly it stopped. They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening. The sun was setting. All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off gently into the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of it all, and the general opinion seemed to be good. A little way away could be heard the sound of children playing, and a little further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town. The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made of white stone. The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves. The sun had nearly set. As if out of nowhere, music began. Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped. A voice said, \u2018This \u2026\u2019 Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped. \u2018I will tell you about it,\u2019 he said quietly. The place was peaceful. Arthur felt happy. Even Ford seemed cheerful. They walked a short way in the direction of the town, and the Informational Illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant. Only Slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of sorts. He stopped and looked up. It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did at the end, so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurrily experienced, something nasty must be about to happen. He was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to somewhere as idyllic as this. He too glanced up. There was nothing in the sky. \u2018They\u2019re not about to attack here, are they?\u2019 he said. He realized that this was merely a recording he was walking through, but he still felt alarmed. \u2018Nothing is about to attack here,\u2019 said Slartibartfast in a voice which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. \u2018This is where it all starts. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit.\u2019 He stared up into the sky. The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from north to south, was utterly and completely black. 11 Stomp stomp. Whirrr. \u2018Pleased to be of service.\u2019 \u2018Shut up.\u2019 \u2018Thank you.\u2019 Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp. Whirrr. \u2018Thank you for making a simple door very happy.\u2019 \u2018Hope your diodes rot.\u2019 \u2018Thank you. Have a nice day.\u2019 Stomp stomp stomp stomp. Whirrr. \u2018It is my pleasure to open for you \u2026\u2019 \u2018Zark off.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.\u2019 \u2018I said Zark off.\u2019 \u2018Thank you for listening to this message.\u2019 Stomp stomp stomp stomp. \u2018Wop.\u2019 Zaphod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around the Heart of Gold for days, and so far no door had said \u2018wop\u2019 to him. He was fairly certain that no door had said \u2018wop\u2019 to him now. It was not the sort of thing doors said. Too concise. Furthermore, there were not enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said \u2018wop\u2019, which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship. It was dark. Most of the ship\u2019s non essential systems were closed down. It was drifting idly in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the inky blackness of space. So which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected \u2018wop\u2019? He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor. It was all in deep shadow. There were just the very dim pinkish outlines to the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, though he had tried every way he could think of of stopping them. The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other, because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul. It had indeed been an error. It had been late one night \u2013 of course. It had been a difficult day \u2013 of course. There had been soulful music playing on the ship\u2019s sound system \u2013 of course. And he had, of course, been slightly drunk. In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of soul searching had applied, but it had, nevertheless, clearly been an error. Standing now, silent and alone, in the dark corridor he remembered the moment and shivered. His one head looked one way and his other the other and each decided that the other was the way to go. He listened but could hear nothing. All there had been was the \u2018wop\u2019. It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word. He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge. There at least he would feel in control. He stopped again. The way he was feeling he didn\u2019t think he was an awfully good person to be in control. The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been discovering that he actually had a soul. In fact he\u2019d always more or less assumed that he had one as he had a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of somethings, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep within him had given him a severe jolt. And then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasn\u2019t the totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to expect had jolted him again. Then he had thought about what his position actually was and the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right. \u2018Freedom,\u2019 he said aloud. Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom. \u2018I can\u2019t cope with it,\u2019 he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn\u2019t yet reported on the condition of the first. He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right. He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well. He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth for moral support. \u2018You\u2019re drinking too much,\u2019 said Trillian. His heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now see into a whole person. He gave up and looked at the navigation screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of stars. \u2018Excitement and adventure and really wild things,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Look,\u2019 she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near him, \u2018it\u2019s quite understandable that you\u2019re going to feel a little aimless for a bit.\u2019 He boggled at her. He had never seen anyone sit on their own lap before. \u2018Wow,\u2019 he said. He had another drink. \u2018You\u2019ve finished the mission you\u2019ve been on for years.\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t been on it. I\u2019ve tried to avoid being on it.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve still finished it.\u2019 He grunted. There seemed to be a terrific party going on in his stomach. \u2018I think it finished me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox, I can go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the known sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well \u2026\u2019 \u2018Are they?\u2019 \u2018As far as I can tell. I\u2019m not an expert in personal relationships \u2026\u2019 Trillian raised her eyebrows. \u2018I am,\u2019 he added, \u2018one hell of a guy. I can do anything I want only I just don\u2019t have the faintest idea what.\u2019 He paused. \u2018One thing,\u2019 he further added, \u2018has suddenly ceased to lead to another\u2019 \u2013 in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair. Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the ship\u2019s copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. It had some advice to offer on drunkenness. \u2018Go to it,\u2019 it said, \u2018and good luck.\u2019 It was cross referenced to the entry concerning the size of the Universe and ways of coping with that. Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday planet, and one of the wonders of the Galaxy. Han Wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra luxury hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain. The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against. Little is known of how this came about because none of the geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there. Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great white running shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport. The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground, and Trillian was enjoying herself. She heard Zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship. \u2018How are you?\u2019 she said over the general intercom. \u2018Fine,\u2019 he said brightly, \u2018terribly well.\u2019 \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018In the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Staying here.\u2019 After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway. \u2018Heigh ho,\u2019 said Eddie the computer. Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times and pushed the intercom switch. \u2018I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this point.\u2019 \u2018Probably not,\u2019 replied Zaphod from wherever he was. \u2018I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of yourself.\u2019 \u2018Whatever you think, I think,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018RECREATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITIES\u2019 was a heading which caught Trillian\u2019s eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip through the Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic drinks dispenser and read about how to fly. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying. There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it. The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it\u2019s going to hurt. That is, it\u2019s going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard. Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties. One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally. It\u2019s no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won\u2019t. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you\u2019re halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it\u2019s going to hurt if you fail to miss it. It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal. Hence most people\u2019s failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport. If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phylum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner. This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration. Bob and float, float and bob. Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher. Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful. They are most likely to say something along the lines of, \u2018Good God, you can\u2019t possibly be flying!\u2019 It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right. Waft higher and higher. Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly. DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY. When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve. You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just \u2013 allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway. You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt. There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all important moment of distraction. They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments. Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them. Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod wasn\u2019t really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for walking through mountains or for trying to get the Brantisvogan Civil Service to acknowledge a change of address card, which were the other things listed under the heading \u2018Recreational Impossibilities\u2019. Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius Syneca, a world of ice, snow, mind hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from the snow plains of Liska to the summit of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis and a team of Syneca Snowhounds, but the view from the top, a view which takes in the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism Mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights, is one which first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, and Trillian, for one, felt that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty. They went into a low orbit. There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius Syneca beneath them. Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the other doing crosswords till late into the night. Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get Zaphod talking. She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen synthomatics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive \u2013 delicately oiled meats, scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines. She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things through. \u2018Zark off,\u2019 said Zaphod. Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life. She didn\u2019t even programme any coordinates, she hadn\u2019t the faintest idea where she was going, she just went \u2013 a random row of dots flowing through the Universe. \u2018Anything,\u2019 she said to herself as she left, \u2018is better than this.\u2019 \u2018Good job too,\u2019 muttered Zaphod to himself, turned over and failed to go to sleep. The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn\u2019t there. He ignored the computer\u2019s querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals. After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing to see. Nothing was about to happen. Lying in bed one night \u2013 and night was now virtually continuous on the ship \u2013 he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some sort of perspective. He sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to set out and find him. Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed. It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he heard the \u2018wop\u2019 said, and it made him very nervous. He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis. He laid his fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration. And now he could quite clearly hear slight noises, and could hear where they were coming from \u2013 they were coming from the bridge. Moving his hand along the wall he came across something he was glad to find. He moved on a little further, quietly. \u2018Computer?\u2019 he hissed. \u2018Mmmm?\u2019 said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly. \u2018Is there someone on this ship?\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm,\u2019 said the computer. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm mmm mmmmm,\u2019 said the computer. \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm.\u2019 Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands. \u2018Oh, Zarquon,\u2019 he muttered to himself. Then he stared up the corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which the gagged terminals were situated. \u2018Computer,\u2019 he hissed again. \u2018Mmmmm?\u2019 \u2018When I ungag you \u2026\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm.\u2019 \u2018Remind me to punch myself in the mouth.\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm mmm?\u2019 \u2018Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for no. Is it dangerous?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm.\u2019 \u2018It is?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm.\u2019 \u2018You didn\u2019t just go \u201cmmmm\u201d twice?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm mmmm.\u2019 \u2018Hmmmm.\u2019 He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way down it, which was true. He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and he stopped dead. He hadn\u2019t been able to turn off the doors\u2019 courtesy voice circuits. This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter unobserved. He leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words which his other head was quite shocked to hear. He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the sensor field which extended out into the corridor and told the door when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark. He pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of the field. He held his breath, and congratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ship\u2019s gym. He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point. He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as quickly and as quietly as he could, \u2018Door, if you can hear me, say so very very quietly.\u2019 Very very quietly, the door murmured, \u2018I can hear you.\u2019 \u2018Good. Now, in a moment, I\u2019m going to ask you to open. When you open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?\u2019 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2018And I don\u2019t want you to say to me that I have made a simple door very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done, OK?\u2019 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2018And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?\u2019 \u2018I understand.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 said Zaphod, tensing himself, \u2018open now.\u2019 The door slid open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly through. The door closed quietly behind him. \u2018Is that the way you like it, Mr Beeblebrox?\u2019 said the door out loud. \u2018I want you to imagine,\u2019 said Zaphod to the group of white robots who swung round to stare at him at that point, \u2018that I have an extremely powerful Kill O Zap blaster pistol in my hand.\u2019 There was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots regarded him with hideously dead eyes. They stood very still. There was something intensely macabre about their appearance, especially to Zaphod who had never seen one before or ever known anything about them. The Krikkit Wars belonged to the ancient past of the Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with the result (a) that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a period of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at this moment. He stared at them in shock. It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil. From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear. They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship. Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold itself. The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body, mind and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed to bear this impression out. Before going on to what it actually said, it is worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten billion years. If he had paid more attention to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic being, he might have been more impressed by this honour. The robot\u2019s voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It had almost a cultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it was. It said, \u2018You do have a Kill O Zap blaster pistol in your hand.\u2019 Zaphod didn\u2019t know what it meant for a moment, but then he glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, \u2018well, I wouldn\u2019t want to overtax your imagination, robot.\u2019 For a while nobody said anything, and Zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him. \u2018I can\u2019t help noticing that you have parked your ship,\u2019 he said with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, \u2018through mine.\u2019 There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was simply locked through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing more than two combs. Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions. \u2018\u2026 haven\u2019t you?\u2019 he added. \u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the robot. \u2018Er, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018So what are you cats doing here?\u2019 Silence. \u2018Robots,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018what are you robots doing here?\u2019 \u2018We have come,\u2019 rasped the robot, \u2018for the Gold Bail.\u2019 Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration. The robot seemed to understand this. \u2018The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek,\u2019 continued the robot, \u2018to release our Masters from Krikkit.\u2019 Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again. \u2018The Key,\u2019 continued the robot simply, \u2018was disintegrated in time and space. The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives your ship. It will be reconstituted in the Key. Our Masters shall be released. The Universal Readjustment will continue.\u2019 Zaphod nodded again. \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 he said. A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot\u2019s totally expressionless face. He seemed to be finding the conversation depressing. \u2018Obliteration,\u2019 it said. \u2018We seek the Key,\u2019 it repeated. \u2018We already have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex Pillar. In a moment we will have the Gold Bail \u2026\u2019 \u2018No you won\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018We will,\u2019 stated the robot. \u2018No you won\u2019t. It makes my ship work.\u2019 \u2018In a moment,\u2019 repeated the robot patiently, \u2018we will have the Gold Bail \u2026\u2019 \u2018You will not,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018And then we must go,\u2019 said the robot, in all seriousness, \u2018to a party.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Zaphod, startled. \u2018Can I come?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the robot. \u2018We are going to shoot you.\u2019 \u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod, waggling his gun. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the robot, and they shot him. Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down. 12 \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Listen and watch.\u2019 Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit. The sky was dark and empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze. They stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted around them. Arthur squatted and felt the Informational Illusion of the soil and the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass strong. It was hard to avoid the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects. The sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape. Still, he supposed, it\u2019s a question of what you\u2019re used to. He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of the hill. He looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction. As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town. They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song about how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his feet up by the fire one evening, humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex. \u2018The Masters of Krikkit,\u2019 breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones. Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment\u2019s confusion. Then the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he discovered that he still didn\u2019t understand what the old man meant. \u2018What?\u2019 he said. \u2018The Masters of Krikkit,\u2019 said Slartibartfast again, and if his breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in Hades with bronchitis. Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point. The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they seemed a little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical perhaps, one wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to spend a long coach journey with them, but the point was that if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough. So why all this rasping lungwork from Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them? Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too. He hadn\u2019t quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and what \u2026 Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what was going through his mind. \u2018The game you know as cricket,\u2019 he said, and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, \u2018is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races in the Galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into what I\u2019m afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game. \u2018Rather fond of it myself,\u2019 he added, \u2018but in most people\u2019s eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesquely bad taste. Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket, that\u2019s very nasty.\u2019 \u2018Um,\u2019 said Arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his cognitive synapses were coping with this as best they could, \u2018um.\u2019 \u2018And these,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural and indicating the group of Krikkit men who had now walked past them, \u2018are the ones who started it all, and it will start tonight. Come, we will follow, and see why.\u2019 They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they were simply walking through a recorded Informational Illusion, they could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them. Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted McCartney Kent and Sussex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for Hampshire. \u2018You must surely know,\u2019 said Slartibartfast to Ford, \u2018what it is that is about to happen?\u2019 \u2018Me?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Did you not learn ancient galactic history when you were a child?\u2019 \u2018I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018it was very distracting. Which isn\u2019t to say that I didn\u2019t learn some pretty stunning things.\u2019 At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the party were singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have had McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester and gazing intently over the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond, had some curious lyrics. The songwriter was referring to meeting with a girl not \u2018under the moon\u2019 or \u2018beneath the stars\u2019 but \u2018above the grass\u2019, which struck Arthur as being a little prosaic. Then he looked up again at the bewilderingly blank sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave him a feeling of being alone in the Universe, and he said so. \u2018No,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, \u2018the people of Krikkit have never thought to themselves \u201cWe are alone in the Universe.\u201d They are surrounded by a huge dust cloud, you see, their single sun with its single world, and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy. Because of the dust cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky. At night it is totally blank. During the day there is the sun, but you can\u2019t look directly at that so they don\u2019t. They are hardly aware of the sky. It\u2019s as if they had a blind spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon. \u2018You see, the reason why they have never thought \u201cWe are alone in the Universe\u201d is that until tonight they don\u2019t know about the Universe. Until tonight.\u2019 He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him. \u2018Imagine,\u2019 he said, \u2018never even thinking \u201cWe are alone\u201d simply because it has never occurred to you to think that there\u2019s any other way to be.\u2019 He moved on again. \u2018I\u2019m afraid this is going to be a little unnerving,\u2019 he added. As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high up in the sightless sky above them. They glanced upwards in alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing. Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to do with it. They were glancing around themselves in consternation, left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the ground. It never occurred to them to look upwards. The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing was something that you had to be there to experience. Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the Starship Bistromath. Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a majestic and luxurious cruise liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artrifactovol some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason. It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history (see note below on the Campaign for Real Time) but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability Physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was fully, or at all, understood. The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a prototype Improbability Field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to ensure that it was Infinitely Improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship. They did not realize that because of the quasi reciprocal and circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately. The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser lit tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message \u2013 an SOS \u2013 before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure. However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another. It was conclusively proved that more people watched tri D TV coverage of the launch than actually existed at the time, and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of audience research. Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins is the star around which most of the Galaxy\u2019s major insurance underwriters live, or rather lived. But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to mind, such as the Galactic Fleet Battleships \u2013 the GSS Daring, the GSS Audacity and the GSS Suicidal Insanity \u2013 are all spoken of with awe, pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known emotions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit. This is not because it was a wonderful ship. It wasn\u2019t. It was crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been knocked up in somebody\u2019s backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked up. The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was done well (it wasn\u2019t) but that it was done at all. The period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the launching of this their first spaceship was almost exactly a year. Ford Prefect was extremely grateful as he strapped himself in, that this was just another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe. In real life it wasn\u2019t a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in China. \u2018Extremely rickety\u2019 was one phrase which sprang to mind, and \u2018Please may I get out?\u2019 was another. \u2018This is going to fly?\u2019 said Arthur, giving gaunt looks at the lashed together pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship. Slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing. Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed. \u2018Why not,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018go mad?\u2019 In front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence for the very good reason that they weren\u2019t actually there, were the three pilots. They also had constructed the ship. They had been on the hill path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs. Their brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien spaceship. They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt up spaceship, all the while singing lilting spaceship stripping ditties. They had then built their own ship and this was it. This was their ship, and they were currently singing a little song about that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership. The chorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage, away from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up. Pow, they took off. They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was doing. \u2018No way,\u2019 said Ford a while later after they had recovered from the shock of acceleration, and were climbing up out of the planet\u2019s atmosphere, \u2018no way,\u2019 he repeated, \u2018does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I don\u2019t believe it. Prove it to me and I still won\u2019t believe it.\u2019 He shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness outside it. The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast fast wound them through it. Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow, spherical dust cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out. It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit. The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on Arthur\u2019s heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit pilots which hung in the air like a thick static charge. They were now on the very boundary of the historical consciousness of their race. This was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated, or even known that there was any speculation to be done. The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship. Inside was the silence of history. Their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit. History was gathering itself to deliver another blow. Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone. They flew out of the cloud. They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear. For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe. And then they turned round. \u2018It\u2019ll have to go,\u2019 the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for home. On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms. 13 \u2018So you see,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, slowly stirring his artificially constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, \u2018how it is.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What do I do,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018with this piece of chicken?\u2019 Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely. \u2018Toy with it,\u2019 he said, \u2018toy with it.\u2019 He demonstrated with his own piece. Arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four dimensionally through what Slartibartfast had assured him was five dimensional space. \u2018Overnight,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018the whole population of Krikkit was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 if whimsical \u2026\u2019 interpolated Arthur. \u2018\u2026 ordinary people,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018into charming, delightful, intelligent \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 whimsical \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 manic xenophobes. The idea of a Universe didn\u2019t fit into their world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn\u2019t cope with it. And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they decided to destroy it. What\u2019s the matter now?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like this wine very much,\u2019 said Arthur sniffing it. \u2018Well, send it back. It\u2019s all part of the mathematics of it.\u2019 Arthur did so. He didn\u2019t like the topography of the waiter\u2019s smile, but he\u2019d never liked graphs anyway. \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Back to the Room of Informational Illusions,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of a paper napkin, \u2018for the second half.\u2019 14 \u2018The people of Krikkit,\u2019 said His High Judgmental Supremacy, Judiciary Pag, LIVR (the Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed), Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, \u2018are, well, you know, they\u2019re just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel the same way some mornings. Shit. \u2018OK,\u2019 he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial Beach Loafers, \u2018so you wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to share a Galaxy with these guys.\u2019 This was true. The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence. The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow. \u2018I mean,\u2019 continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the ultra modern (this was ten billion years ago, when \u2018ultra modern\u2019 meant lots of stainless steel and brushed concrete) and huge courtroom, \u2018these guys are just obsessed.\u2019 This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose \u2013 the destruction of everything that wasn\u2019t Krikkit. It is also the only explanation for their bewilderingly sudden grasp of all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of spaceships, and their millions of lethal white robots. These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them \u2013 in most cases, however, the terror was extremely short lived, as was the person experiencing the terror. They were savage, single minded flying battle machines. They wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which, brandished one way, would knock down buildings and, brandished another way, fired blistering Omni Destruct O Zap rays and, brandished a third way, launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor incendiary devices to Maxi Slorta Hypernuclear Devices which could take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with the battleclubs simultaneously primed them and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles. \u2018OK,\u2019 said Judiciary Pag again, \u2018so we won.\u2019 He paused and chewed a little gum. \u2018We won,\u2019 he repeated, \u2018but that\u2019s no big deal. I mean a medium sized galaxy against one little world, and how long did it take us? Clerk of the Court?\u2019 \u2018M\u2019lud?\u2019 said the severe little man in black, rising. \u2018How long, kiddo?\u2019 \u2018It is a trifle difficult, m\u2019lud, to be precise in this matter. Time and distance \u2026\u2019 \u2018Relax, guy, be vague.\u2019 \u2018I hardly like to be vague, m\u2019lud, over such a \u2026\u2019 \u2018Bite the bullet and be it.\u2019 The Clerk of the Court blinked at him. It was clear that like most of the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108, as his private name was known, inexplicably, to be) a rather distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and a cad. He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared to be right. \u2018Er, well, m\u2019lud, very approximately, two thousand years,\u2019 the Clerk murmured unhappily. \u2018And how many guys zilched out?\u2019 \u2018Two grillion, m\u2019lud.\u2019 The Clerk sat down. A hydro spectic photo of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly. Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, depending on metabolism and custom. Behind a wall of Zap Proof Crystal stood a representative group of the people of Krikkit, looking with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment on them. This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it. He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair. \u2018That\u2019s a whole lotta stiffs,\u2019 he said quietly. The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view. \u2018So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldn\u2019t want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they\u2019re just gonna keep at it, not if they\u2019re not gonna learn to relax a little. I mean it\u2019s just gonna be continual nervous time, isn\u2019t it, right? Pow, pow, pow, when are they next coming at us? Peaceful coexistence is just right out, right? Get me some water somebody, thank you.\u2019 He sat back and sipped reflectively. \u2018OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018hear me, hear me. It\u2019s, like, these guys, you know, are entitled to their own view of the Universe. And according to their view, which the Universe forced on them, right, they did right. Sounds crazy, but I think you\u2019ll agree. They believe in \u2026\u2019 He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his Judicial jeans. \u2018They believe in \u201cpeace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms\u201d.\u2019 He shrugged. \u2018I\u2019ve heard a lot worse,\u2019 he said. He scratched his crotch reflectively. \u2018Freeeow,\u2019 he said. He took another sip of water, then held it up to the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round. \u2018Hey, is there something in this water?\u2019 he said. \u2018Er, no, m\u2019lud,\u2019 said the Court Usher who had brought it to him, rather nervously. \u2018Then take it away,\u2019 snapped Judiciary Pag, \u2018and put something in it. I got an idea.\u2019 He pushed away the glass and leaned forward. \u2018Hear me, hear me,\u2019 he said. The solution was brilliant, and went like this: The planet of Krikkit was to be encased for perpetuity in an envelope of Slo Time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable. Escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible unless it were unlocked from the outside. When the rest of the Universe came to its final end, when the whole of creation reached its dying fall (this was all, of course, in the days before it was known that the end of the Universe would be a spectacular catering venture) and life and matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Krikkit and its sun would emerge from its Slo Time envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved, in the twilight of the Universal void. The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the envelope. The Key would be the symbol of the Galaxy \u2013 the Wikkit Gate. By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary Pag was already in the Sens O Shower with a rather nice member of the jury that he\u2019d slipped a note to half an hour earlier. 15 Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108 had cut the bottoms off his Galactic state jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having Essence of Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of the jury. She was a Soolfinian girl from beyond the Cloudworlds of Yaga. She had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal bodies. \u2018Did you hear the news?\u2019 she said. \u2018Weeeelaaaaah!\u2019 said Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108, and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this was on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all based on hearsay. \u2018No,\u2019 he added, when the thing that had made him say \u2018Weeeeelaaaaah\u2019 had stopped happening. He moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval Vod\u2019s three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest tanning power ever known. A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed along the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next. On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It drifted back to sea. \u2018I hope it isn\u2019t good news,\u2019 muttered Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108, \u2018\u2019cos I don\u2019t think I could bear it.\u2019 \u2018Your Krikkit judgment was carried out today,\u2019 said the girl sumptuously. There was no need to say such a straightforward thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway because it was that sort of day. \u2018I heard it on the radio,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I went back to the ship for the oil.\u2019 \u2018Uhuh,\u2019 murmured Zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled sand. \u2018Something happened,\u2019 she said. \u2018Mmmm?\u2019 \u2018Just after the Slo Time envelope was locked,\u2019 she said, and paused a moment from rubbing in the Essence of Qualactin, \u2018a Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize the Key.\u2019 Zipo sat up sharply. \u2018Hey, what?\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big Bang down. \u2018Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space\u2013time continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever.\u2019 She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to her fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down. \u2018Do what you did a moment or two ago,\u2019 he murmured. \u2018That?\u2019 she said. \u2018No, no,\u2019 he said, \u2018that.\u2019 She tried again. \u2018That?\u2019 she asked. \u2018Weeeeelaaaaaah!\u2019 Again, you had to be there. The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again. A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him. 16 \u2018Nothing is lost for ever,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, his face flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away, \u2018except for the Cathedral of Chalesm.\u2019 \u2018The what?\u2019 said Arthur with a start. \u2018The Cathedral of Chalesm,\u2019 repeated Slartibartfast. \u2018It was during the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time that I\u2014\u2019 \u2018The what?\u2019 said Arthur again. The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped would be one last onslaught on this story. The robot waiter moved through the space\u2013time matrices in a way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the candle and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into parking orbit round a strange planet. The waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro. \u2018All will become clear,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018When?\u2019 \u2018In a minute. Listen. The time streams are now very polluted. There\u2019s a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world. Eddies in the space\u2013time continuum, you see.\u2019 \u2018So I hear,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Look, where are we going?\u2019 said Ford, pushing his chair back from the table with impatience. \u2018Because I\u2019m eager to get there.\u2019 \u2018We are going,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, in a slow, measured voice, \u2018to try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from the Slo Time envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad Masters.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that you mentioned a party.\u2019 \u2018I did,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, and hung his head. He realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls. The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out, and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it the way an Arcturan Megaleach attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship. \u2018When,\u2019 said Ford eagerly, \u2018do we get there?\u2019 \u2018When I\u2019ve finished telling you why we have to go there.\u2019 \u2018I know why I\u2019m going,\u2019 said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his hands behind his head. He gave one of his smiles which made people twitch. Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement. He had been planning to learn to play the octaventral heebie phone \u2013 a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the wrong number of mouths. He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important. Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part time work for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now found himself spending his fast declining years combating evil and trying to save the Galaxy. He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily. \u2018Listen,\u2019 he said, \u2018at Camtim\u2014\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later. I noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces of the missing Key. Only two I could trace exactly \u2013 the Wooden Pillar, which appeared on your planet, and the Silver Bail. It seems to be at some sort of party. We must go there to retrieve it before the Krikkit robots find it, or who knows what may happen?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford firmly. \u2018We must go to the party in order to drink a lot and dance with girls.\u2019 \u2018But haven\u2019t you understood everything I \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, \u2018I\u2019ve understood it all perfectly well. That\u2019s why I want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still any left. If everything you\u2019ve shown us is true \u2026\u2019 \u2018True? Of course it\u2019s true.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 then we don\u2019t stand a whelk\u2019s chance in a supernova.\u2019 \u2018A what?\u2019 said Arthur sharply again. He had been following the conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the thread now. \u2018A whelk\u2019s chance in a supernova,\u2019 repeated Ford without losing momentum. \u2018The\u2014\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s a whelk got to do with a supernova?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018It doesn\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford levelly, \u2018stand a chance in one.\u2019 He paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly puzzled looks clambering across Arthur\u2019s face told him that it wasn\u2019t. \u2018A supernova,\u2019 said Ford as quickly and as clearly as he could, \u2018is a star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a super heavy neutron star. It\u2019s a star which burns up other stars, got it? Nothing stands a chance in a supernova.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The\u2014\u2019 \u2018So why a whelk particularly?\u2019 \u2018Why not a whelk? Doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early fierce momentum as best he could. \u2018The point is,\u2019 he said, \u2018that people like you and me, Slartibartfast, and Arthur \u2013 particularly and especially Arthur \u2013 are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you like.\u2019 Slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage. He started to speak. \u2018 \u2013 \u2026\u2019 is as far as he got. \u2018We\u2019re not obsessed by anything, you see,\u2019 insisted Ford. \u2018\u2026 \u2019 \u2018And that\u2019s the deciding factor. We can\u2019t win against obsession. They care, we don\u2019t. They win.\u2019 \u2018I care about lots of things,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, his voice trembling partly with annoyance, but partly also with uncertainty. \u2018Such as?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018Life, the Universe. Everything, really. Fjords.\u2019 \u2018Would you die for them?\u2019 \u2018Fjords?\u2019 blinked Slartibartfast in surprise. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Well, then.\u2019 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t see the point, to be honest.\u2019 \u2018And I still can\u2019t see the connection,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018with whelks.\u2019 Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point. \u2018The point is,\u2019 he hissed, \u2018that we are not obsessive people, and we don\u2019t stand a chance against \u2026\u2019 \u2018Except for your sudden obsession with whelks,\u2019 pursued Arthur, \u2018which I still haven\u2019t understood.\u2019 \u2018Will you please leave whelks out of it?\u2019 \u2018I will if you will,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018You brought the subject up.\u2019 \u2018It was an error,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018forget them. The point is this.\u2019 He leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers. \u2018What was I talking about?\u2019 he said wearily. \u2018Let\u2019s just go down to the party,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018for whatever reason.\u2019 He stood up, shaking his head. \u2018I think that\u2019s what I was trying to say,\u2019 said Ford. For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom. 17 Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace. History is being polluted. The Encyclopaedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn\u2019t spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place. One rationalization of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk. The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well. Here is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to some people, but to others it is crucial. It is certainly significant in that it was this single event which caused the Campaign for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it last? It depends which way round you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly vexed question). There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what are widely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the finest poems in existence, the Songs of the Long Land. They are/were unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn\u2019t speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion, truth and a sense of the wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldn\u2019t pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of perspective and soda. They were that good. Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. He lived there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or correcting fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and what he thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had left him and precisely what he thought about that. Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. News of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier. Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some high quality correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few words to that effect. They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the situation \u2013 with some difficulty \u2013 to him, and did indeed persuade him. In fact they persuaded him to such effect that he became extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write with such precision never got around to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily. He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a problem, but an easily solved one. The manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on the way. Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. Others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so what\u2019s changed? The first people say that that isn\u2019t the point. They aren\u2019t quite certain what the point is, but they are quite sure that that isn\u2019t it. They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try to stop this sort of thing going on. Their case was considerably strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news broke that not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery, but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion production to start on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had now never been built in the first place. Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable. So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another. \u2018The past,\u2019 they say, \u2018is now truly like a foreign country. They do things exactly the same there.\u2019 18 Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to. He looked around for the others. They weren\u2019t there. He looked around for the others again. They still weren\u2019t there. He closed his eyes. He opened them. He looked around for the others. They obstinately persisted in their absence. He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across his face. So he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed put. If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm grip. If this was a party it was a very bad one, so bad, in fact, that everyone else had left. He abandoned this line of thought as futile. Obviously this wasn\u2019t a party. It was a cave, or a labyrinth, or a tunnel or something \u2013 there was insufficient light to tell. All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness. The only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which sounded worried. He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to say \u2026 \u2018Yes?\u2019 This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved him. He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him it was a hollow dirge and he stopped. His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half expected suddenly to see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him. He caught his breath. They didn\u2019t. He let it go again. He didn\u2019t know what he did expect. Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign. It said, silently: YOU HAVE BEEN DIVERTED The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at all certain he liked. It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish. Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick of his imagination. A neon sign is either on or off, depending on whether it has electricity running through it or not. There was no way, he told himself, that it could possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a contemptuous flourish. He hugged himself tightly in his dressing gown and shivered, nevertheless. The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with just three dots and a comma. Like this: \u2026, Only in green neon. It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a second or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the sentence was not complete. Trying with almost superhuman pedantry, he further reflected. Or at least, inhuman pedantry. The sentence then completed itself with these two words: ARTHUR DENT. He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at it. It still said ARTHUR DENT, so he reeled again. Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him blinking in the darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina. WELCOME, the sign now suddenly said. After a moment, it added: I DON\u2019T THINK. The stone cold fear which had been hovering around Arthur all this time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him. He tried to fight it off. He dropped into a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He peered huntedly into the darkness. \u2018Er, hello?\u2019 he said. He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the \u2018er\u2019. At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum. He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his heart beating. He listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasn\u2019t his heart, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum. Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves, and leapt off. He put a hand out on to the floor to steady his alert crouch, which wasn\u2019t holding up very well. The sign changed itself again. It said: DO NOT BE ALARMED. After a pause, it added: BE VERY, VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT. Once again it flicked off. Once again it left him in darkness. His eyes seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn\u2019t certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted to leave at this point. \u2018Hello?\u2019 he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged and aggressive self assertion into it. \u2018Is anyone there?\u2019 There was no reply, nothing. This unnerved Arthur even more than a reply would have done, and he began to back away from the scary nothingness. And the more he backed away, the more scared he became. After a while he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming up from behind. Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather quickly. There was nothing there. Just blackness. This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that, back the way he had come. After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been backing away from in the first place. This, he couldn\u2019t help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do. He decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been backing, and turned around again. It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one, because there was an indescribably hideous monster dancing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of. \u2018Bet you weren\u2019t expecting to see me again,\u2019 said the monster, which Arthur couldn\u2019t help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could tell that he hadn\u2019t met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights. It was \u2026 it was \u2026 it was \u2026 Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look a little familiar. A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at was a six foot high hologram of a housefly. He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six foot high hologram of a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he had heard. It was a terribly realistic hologram. It vanished. \u2018Or perhaps you remember me better,\u2019 said the voice suddenly, and it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, \u2018as the rabbit.\u2019 With a sudden ping, there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth with him, a huge, monstrously, hideously soft and lovable rabbit \u2013 an image again, but one on which every single soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat. Arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eye. \u2018Born in darkness,\u2019 rumbled the voice, \u2018raised in darkness. One morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive instrument made of flint. \u2018Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard, as I recall. \u2018You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in. I happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again and you swatted me. Again. Only this time you swatted me with the bag you\u2019d made of my previous skin. \u2018Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you are also staggeringly tactless.\u2019 The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped. \u2018I see you have lost the bag,\u2019 said the voice. \u2018Probably got bored with it, did you?\u2019 Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to explain that he had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with him wherever he went, but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard skin, and wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d had a few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was, and wasn\u2019t one he would have chosen himself, and Heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn\u2019t his, and he would much rather have his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or rather its component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous owner, viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address. All he actually managed to say was \u2018Erp.\u2019 \u2018Meet the newt you trod on,\u2019 said the voice. And there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant green scaly newt. Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit. He yelped again, but could find nowhere to leap to. \u2018That was me, too,\u2019 continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, \u2018as if you didn\u2019t know.\u2019 \u2018Know?\u2019 said Arthur with a start. \u2018Know?\u2019 \u2018The interesting thing about reincarnation,\u2019 rasped the voice, \u2018is that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to them.\u2019 He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned there was already quite enough effect going on. \u2018I was aware,\u2019 hissed the voice, \u2018that is, I became aware. Slowly. Gradually.\u2019 He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath. \u2018I could hardly help it, could I,\u2019 he bellowed, \u2018when the same thing kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any time, I\u2019m just getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent \u2013 pow, he kills me. \u2018Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit of a pointer. Bit of a bloody giveaway! \u2018\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent ended venture into the land of the living, \u201cthat man who just ran over me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little familiar \u2026\u201d And gradually I got to piece it together, Dent, you multiple me murderer!\u2019 The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors. Arthur stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief. \u2018Here\u2019s the moment, Dent,\u2019 shrieked the voice, now reaching a feverish pitch of hatred, \u2018here\u2019s the moment when at last I knew!\u2019 It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in front of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but here\u2019s an attempt at a description of how hideous it was. It was a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale like creature rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones. High above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves, which \u2026 Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it. He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes. When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone. The corridor was dark and, briefly, silent. He was alone with his thoughts. They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had a chaperone. The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large section of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark blankness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the same way that a mouse looks into a dark dog kennel. And the voice spoke to him again. \u2018Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent,\u2019 it said. \u2018I dare you to tell me it was a coincidence!\u2019 \u2018It was a coincidence,\u2019 said Arthur quickly. \u2018It was not!\u2019 came the answering bellow. \u2018It was,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it was \u2026\u2019 \u2018If it was a coincidence, then my name,\u2019 roared the voice, \u2018is not Agrajag!!!\u2019 \u2018And presumably,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you would claim that that was your name.\u2019 \u2018Yes!\u2019 hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism. \u2018Well, I\u2019m afraid it was still a coincidence,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Come in here and say that!\u2019 howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy again. Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he nearly said that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost its footing towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and revealed what it was he had walked into. It was a Cathedral of Hate. It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but actually sprained. It was huge. It was horrific. It had a Statue in it. We will come to the Statue in a moment. The vast, incomprehensibly vast, chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. It seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it. It was black. Where it wasn\u2019t black you were inclined to wish that it was, because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye defying colours, from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead. The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch. The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue, to which we will come in a moment. And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch then it was clear from the gargoyles\u2019 faces that the Statue would have put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it; which they weren\u2019t, and had anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn\u2019t. Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent. The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had asterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which had been slaughtered and of which Arthur had happened to eat a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a fish which Arthur had himself caught and then decided he didn\u2019t like and left on the side of the plate had a double underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as decoration, just to make the point. And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the Statue, to which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, over and over again. And it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly, extremely upset and annoyed. In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe. It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning, searing flame of annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage. And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the Statue in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, there was not an inch of it which wasn\u2019t crammed with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad. From the small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn\u2019t lambasted and vilified by the sculptor. Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravening, bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one man Universe. With each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or doing something which Arthur at first looking couldn\u2019t quite identify. His many feet were mostly stamping on ants. Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things. And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time. \u2018HhhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!\u2019 said Agrajag. He, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat. He waddled slowly around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws. \u2018Look \u2026\u2019 protested Arthur. \u2018HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!\u2019 explained Agrajag, and Arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition. Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery. His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were than if they had been strong, muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds. He had the most astounding collection of teeth. They looked as if they each came from a completely different animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he\u2019d lacerate half his own face along with it, and possibly put an eye out as well. Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a fish in a privet bush. \u2018I was at a cricket match,\u2019 he rasped. This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that Arthur practically choked. \u2018Not in this body,\u2019 screeched the creature, \u2018not in this body! This is my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My kill Arthur Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get it, too.\u2019 \u2018But \u2026\u2019 \u2018I was at,\u2019 roared Agrajag, \u2018a cricket match! I had a weak heart condition, but what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket match? As I\u2019m watching, what happens? \u2018Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of me. The last thing I can\u2019t help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is Arthur Dent wearing a rabbit bone in his beard. Coincidence?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Coincidence?\u2019 screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its broken wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth. On closer examination, such as he\u2019d been hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag\u2019s face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters. He backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He pulled it out and threw it away. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s just fate playing silly buggers with you. With me. With me. It\u2019s a complete coincidence.\u2019 \u2018What have you got against me, Dent?\u2019 snarled the creature, advancing on him in a painful waddle. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018honestly, nothing.\u2019 Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare. \u2018Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you\u2019ve got nothing against, killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social interaction, I would call that. I\u2019d also call it a lie!\u2019 \u2018But look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019m very sorry. There\u2019s been a terrible misunderstanding. I\u2019ve got to go. Have you got a clock? I\u2019m meant to be helping save the Universe.\u2019 He backed away still further. Agrajag advanced still further. \u2018At one point,\u2019 he hissed, \u2018at one point, I decided to give up. Yes. I would not come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And what happened?\u2019 Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and didn\u2019t want to have one either. He found he had backed up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers. He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering above him. He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing. \u2018I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world,\u2019 pursued Agrajag, \u2018as a bunch of petunias. In, I might add, a bowl. This particular happy little lifetime started off with me, in my bowl, unsupported, three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly grim planet. Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, you might think. And you\u2019d be right. That life ended a very short while later, three hundred miles lower. In, I might again add, the fresh wreckage of a whale. My spirit brother.\u2019 He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred. \u2018On the way down,\u2019 he snarled, \u2018I couldn\u2019t help noticing a flashy looking white spaceship. And looking out of a port on this flashy looking spaceship was a smug looking Arthur Dent. Coincidence?!!\u2019 \u2018Yes!\u2019 yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that the arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which leapt easily to the eye. \u2018I must go,\u2019 insisted Arthur. \u2018You may go,\u2019 said Agrajag, \u2018after I have killed you.\u2019 \u2018No, that won\u2019t be any use,\u2019 explained Arthur, beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, \u2018because I have to save the Universe, you see. I have to find a Silver Bail, that\u2019s the point. Tricky thing to do dead.\u2019 \u2018Save the Universe!\u2019 spat Agrajag with contempt. \u2018You should have thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone \u2026\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve never been there,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018\u2026 tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who do you think the bullet bit? What did you say?\u2019 \u2018Never been there,\u2019 repeated Arthur. \u2018What are you talking about? I have to go.\u2019 Agrajag stopped in his tracks. \u2018You must have been there. You were responsible for my death there, as everywhere else. An innocent bystander!\u2019 He quivered. \u2018I\u2019ve never heard of the place,\u2019 insisted Arthur. \u2018I\u2019ve certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I go there later, do you think?\u2019 Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror. \u2018You haven\u2019t been to Stavromula Beta \u2026 yet?\u2019 he whispered. \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about the place. Certainly never been to it, and don\u2019t have any plans to go.\u2019 \u2018Oh, you go there all right,\u2019 muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, \u2018you go there all right. Oh, Zark!\u2019 He tottered, and stared wildly about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. \u2018I\u2019ve brought you here too soon!\u2019 He started to scream and bellow. \u2018I\u2019ve brought you here too Zarking soon!\u2019 Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur. \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you anyway!\u2019 he roared. \u2018Even if it\u2019s a logical impossibility I\u2019m going to Zarking well try! I\u2019m going to blow this whole mountain up!\u2019 He screamed, \u2018Let\u2019s see you get out of this one, Dent!\u2019 He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a small black sacrificial altar. He was shouting so wildly now that he was really carving his face up badly. Arthur leaped down from his vantage place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try to restrain the three quarters crazed creature. He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity crashing down on top of the altar. Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and turned a wild eye on Arthur. \u2018You know what you\u2019ve done? he gurgled painfully. \u2018You\u2019ve only gone and killed me again. I mean, what do you want from me, blood?\u2019 He thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and collapsed, smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so. Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to have done, and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency. He stared wildly around him. The only exit appeared to be the way he came in. He pelted towards it, throwing away the nasty fake leopard skin bag as he did so. As he dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by klaxons, sirens, flashing lights. Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him. It wasn\u2019t flashing. It was daylight. 19 Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our Galaxy is Krikkit (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only apply to our Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension. In some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian Ultra Cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is. \u2018Let\u2019s be blunt, it\u2019s a nasty game\u2019 (says The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy), \u2018but then anyone who has been to \u00a3any of the higher dimensions will know that they\u2019re a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right angles to reality.\u2019 This is another example of the fact that The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped off, especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon, when very few of the regular staff are there. There is a fundamental point here: The history of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is one of idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure and enormously long lunch breaks. The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its financial records, lost in the mists of time. For other, and more curious theories about where they are lost, see below. Most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor called Hurling Frootmig. Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust. There followed many years of penury and heart searching during which he consulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thought about this and that, fooled about with weights, and then, after a chance encounter with the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondoon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a man\u2019s temporal day, and man\u2019s temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so lunch should (a) be seen as the centre of a man\u2019s spiritual life, and (b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide, laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both, and led the Guide on to its first major commercial success. He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunch break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the Guide\u2019s history, since it meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices of an afternoon and saw something worth doing. Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors, who have started undertaking sponsored lunch breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison. In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship \u2013 he merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned. Though well over a century has now passed, many members of the Guide staff still retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put in a solid afternoon\u2019s work. Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore been designated acting editors, and Lig\u2019s desk is still preserved the way he left it, with the addition of a small sign which says \u2018Lig Lury Jr, Editor, Missing, presumed fed\u2019. Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that Lig actually perished in the Guide\u2019s first extraordinary experiments in alternative book keeping. Very little is known of this, and less still said. Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but utterly coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster is liable to get sued to smithereens. It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of UFO sightings there, not only above Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in St John\u2019s Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury in Somerset. Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, witchcraft, ley lines and wart curing, and had now been selected as the site for the new Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide financial records office, and indeed ten years\u2019 worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours before the Vogons arrived. None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockian Ultra Cricket, as played in the higher dimensions. A full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a single volume, they underwent gravitational collapse and became a black hole. A brief summary, however, is as follows: RULE ONE: Grow at least three extra legs. You won\u2019t need them, but it keeps the crowds amused. RULE TWO: Find one good Brockian Ultra Cricket player. Clone him off a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training. RULE THREE: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field and build a high wall round them. The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what\u2019s going on leads them to imagine that it\u2019s a lot more exciting than it really is. A crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history. RULE FOUR: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall for the players. Anything will do \u2013 cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good swing with. RULE FIVE: The players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player scores a \u2018hit\u2019 on another player, he should immediately run away and apologize from a safe distance. Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone. RULE SIX: The winning team shall be the first team that wins. Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of these rules. This is all for the best, because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra Cricket. 20 As Arthur ran darting and panting down the side of the mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight blurred movement; and a lick of heat in the distance behind and above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land began to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word \u2018landslide\u2019 in a way which had never been apparent to him before. It had always just been a word to him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for land to do. It was doing it with him on it. He felt ill with fear and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain slurred, he slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The avalanche began. Stones, then rocks, then boulders pranced past him like clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you. His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the dancing ground. He ran as if running was a terrible sweating sickness, his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him. The logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time. He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair. And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable momentum. But just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his personal time scale previously, and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing. What he was doing was this: he was flying. He glanced around him in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him. He could now do something about that. Blinking with the non effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were hurtling through the air beneath him. He looked downwards with intense curiosity. Between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that is if you discounted the boulders which didn\u2019t stay in it for long, but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity: the same law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have given Arthur a sabbatical. It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness that self preservation instils in the mind, that he mustn\u2019t try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost. So he thought about tulips. It was difficult, but he did. He thought about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought about the interesting variety of colours they came in, and wondered what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew, or had grown, on the Earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a windmill. After a while he got dangerously bored with this train of thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes \u2013 at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about two hundred yards above the ground. He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and tried to look at the situation steadily. He was flying. What was he going to do about it? He looked back down at the ground. He didn\u2019t look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing. There were a couple of things he couldn\u2019t help noticing. One was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself \u2013 there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of himself, and the sadly abused figure of Agrajag. The other was his hold all, the one he had lost at Athens airport. It was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them. Why this should be he could not speculate, but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bag being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway. The thing is, it was there. And the nasty, fake leopard skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to the good, if not entirely to the explicable. He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up. Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldn\u2019t even remember. He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light years from the pulverized remains of his home. Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state in which he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the Universe. Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards, swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground. It went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let him through. Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decisions. He bobbed there lightly. He frowned, but again, as lightly as he could. If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn\u2019t the extra weight just pull him straight to the ground? Mightn\u2019t the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air? Mightn\u2019t he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two? If he did, would he ever be able to fly again? The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever. With this worry in mind he bobbed upwards a little again, just to try the feel of it, the surprising and effortless movement of it. He bobbed, he floated. He tried a little swoop. The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him, his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the swing and holding. Just holding. He stayed there. It was wonderful. And that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag. He would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing. He would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit, but he was certain that he could hold it. He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn\u2019t felt since, since \u2013 well, as far as he could work out, since he was born. He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside, which was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had a wasted ravaged look. He decided not to look at it any more. He would just pick up the bag and then \u2026 he didn\u2019t know what he was going to do after he had picked up the bag. He decided he would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there. He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and turned around. He floated on its body. He didn\u2019t realize, but his body was willoming at this point. He ducked down under the airstream, dipped \u2013 and dived. The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles up towards him. Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer believe he was doing this, and therefore he very nearly wasn\u2019t, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and began to climb back up, couldn\u2019t make it and all of a sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking on the stony ground. He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around, swinging the bag around him in an agony of grief and disappointment. His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way they always had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead. He sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness. He tried hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak. He tripped and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil but a duty free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable shock of that realization he failed to notice for at best ten seconds that he was now flying again. He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical delight. He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the air. Cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents of the hold all. He felt the way he imagined an angel must feel doing its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand filled swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved to think he would never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one. He dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind. Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back. 21 The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation and still no one shows any signs of leaving. Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago now, and there has been no follow up. The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if you don\u2019t have any particular need to believe it, then don\u2019t go and look, because you won\u2019t enjoy it. There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn\u2019t believe anything you hear at parties, and particularly not anything you hear at this one. One of the problems, and it\u2019s one which is obviously going to get worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great grandchildren of the people who wouldn\u2019t leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on, it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both. Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one. So other factors come into operation, like when the drink is going to run out. Now, because of certain things which have happened which seemed like a good idea at the time (and one of the problems with a party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like a good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas), that point seems still to be a long way off. One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was that the party should fly \u2013 not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly, but literally. One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro engineers of the first generation clambered round the building digging this, fixing that, banging very hard on the other, and when the sun rose the following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of happy drunken people which was now floating like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops. Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had might on their side. The transition from full time cocktail party to part time raiding party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years. They looted, they raided, they held whole cities to ransom for fresh supplies of cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers. The problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however, going to have to be faced one day. The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it was when they first started floating over it. It is in bad shape. The party has attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky. It is one hell of a party. It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back. 22 Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him. There was a sound he couldn\u2019t immediately identify, partly because he didn\u2019t know the tune \u2018I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta\u2019 and partly because the band playing it were very tired, and some members of it were playing in three four time, some in four four, and some in a kind of pie eyed \u03c0r2, each according to the amount of sleep he\u2019d managed to grab recently. He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself, he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed to have sprained his wrist. His back, too, was hurting, but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and a little shaken, as who wouldn\u2019t be? He couldn\u2019t understand what a building would be doing flying through the clouds. On the other hand, he would have been a little hard pressed to come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept each other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the building proper. He seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around. It was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its foundations, and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end. Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge, he felt nauseous with vertigo. He pressed himself back against the wall, wet with mist and sweat. His head was swimming freestyle, but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly. Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. He was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about to move an inch closer to the edge. Clutching his hold all he edged along the wall, hoping to find a doorway in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great reassurance to him. He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one, which offered none. The unsteadiness of the building\u2019s flight made him feel sick with fear, and after a short time he took the towel from out of his holdall and did something with it which once again justified its supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch hike round the Galaxy. He put it over his head so he wouldn\u2019t have to see what he was doing. His feet edged along the ground. His outstretched hand edged along the wall. Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly fell straight off. It was another hand. The two hands gripped each other. He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back from his eyes, but it was holding the hold all with the olive oil, the retsina and the postcards of Santorini, and he very much didn\u2019t want to put it down. He experienced one of those \u2018self\u2019 moments, one of those moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think: \u2018Who am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well?\u2019 He whimpered very slightly. He tried to free his hand, but he couldn\u2019t. The other hand was holding his tightly. He had no recourse but to edge onwards towards the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some unfathomable emotion from the owner of the other hand. The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed door. They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building. \u2018Where the Zarking photon have you been?\u2019 hissed Ford, panic stricken. \u2018Er, well,\u2019 stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up that briefly. \u2018Here and there. What are you doing here?\u2019 Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again. \u2018They won\u2019t let us in without a bottle,\u2019 he hissed. The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of colours that protruded dimly through the atmosphere of heady smoke, the carpets thick with ground glass, ash and avocado droppings, and the small group of pterodactyl like creatures in lurex who descended on his cherished bottle of retsina, squawking, \u2018A new pleasure, a new pleasure\u2019, was Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God. \u2018Didn\u2019t I see you at Milliways?\u2019 he was saying. \u2018Were you the one with the hammer?\u2019 \u2018Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more fraught.\u2019 Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the outer dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody could hear at each other and occasionally having crises. \u2018Seems fun,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018What did you say, Arthur?\u2019 \u2018I said, how the hell did you get here?\u2019 \u2018I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe. Have you met Thor? He makes thunder.\u2019 \u2018Hello,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I expect that must be very interesting.\u2019 \u2018Hi,\u2019 said Thor. \u2018It is. Have you got a drink?\u2019 \u2018Er, no actually \u2026\u2019 \u2018Then why don\u2019t you go and get one?\u2019 \u2018See you later, Arthur,\u2019 said Trillian. Something jogged Arthur\u2019s mind, and he looked around huntedly. \u2018Zaphod isn\u2019t here, is he?\u2019 he said. \u2018See you,\u2019 said Trillian firmly, \u2018later.\u2019 Thor glared at him with hard coal black eyes, his beard bristled, what little light there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns on his helmet. He took Trillian\u2019s elbow in his extremely large hand and the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of Volkswagens parking. He led her away. \u2018One of the interesting things about being immortal,\u2019 he said, \u2018is \u2026\u2019 \u2018One of the interesting things about space,\u2019 Arthur heard Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at the old man\u2019s deep eyes and silver beard, \u2018is how dull it is.\u2019 \u2018Dull?\u2019 said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and bloodshot eyes. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so. You see, there\u2019s so much of it and so little in it. Would you like me to quote you some statistics?\u2019 \u2018Er, well \u2026\u2019 \u2018Please, I would like to. They, too, are quite sensationally dull.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll come back and hear them in a moment,\u2019 she said, patted him on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into the heaving crowd. \u2018I thought she\u2019d never go,\u2019 growled the old man. \u2018Come, Earthman \u2026\u2019 \u2018Arthur.\u2019 \u2018We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere.\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t we just relax a little?\u2019 Arthur said. \u2018I\u2019ve had a tough day. Trillian\u2019s here, incidentally, she didn\u2019t say how, it probably doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 \u2018Think of the danger to the Universe \u2026\u2019 \u2018The Universe,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018is big enough and old enough to look after itself for half an hour. All right,\u2019 he added, in response to Slartibartfast\u2019s increasing agitation, \u2018I\u2019ll wander round and see if anybody\u2019s seen it.\u2019 \u2018Good, good,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018good.\u2019 He plunged into the crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed. \u2018Have you seen a bail anywhere?\u2019 said Arthur to a little man who seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody. \u2018It\u2019s made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of the Universe, and about this long.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the enthusiastically wizened little man, \u2018but do have a drink and tell me all about it.\u2019 Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not entirely unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing Sydney Opera House on her head. He was yelling a futile conversation at her above the din. \u2018I like the hat!\u2019 he bawled. \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I said, I like the hat.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not wearing a hat.\u2019 \u2018Well, I like the head then.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I said, I like the head. Interesting bone structure.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements he was performing. \u2018I said, you dance great,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018just don\u2019t nod so much.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just that every time you nod,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018\u2026 ow!\u2019 he added as his partner nodded forward to say \u2018What?\u2019 and once again pecked him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her swept forward skull. \u2018My planet was blown up one morning,\u2019 said Arthur, who had found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, at least, edited highlights of it, \u2018that\u2019s why I\u2019m dressed like this, in my dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you see. I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be coming to a party.\u2019 The little man nodded enthusiastically. \u2018Later, I was thrown off a spaceship. Still in my dressing gown, rather than the spacesuit one would normally expect. Shortly after that I discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was then shot at for a while and blown up. In fact I have been blown up ridiculously often, shot at, insulted, regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently I crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 effervesced the little man, \u2018and did you have a wonderful time?\u2019 Arthur started to choke violently on his drink. \u2018What a wonderfully exciting cough,\u2019 said the little man, quite startled by it, \u2018do you mind if I join you?\u2019 And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and spectacular fit of coughing which caught Arthur so much by surprise that he started to choke violently, discovered he was already doing it and got thoroughly confused. Together they performed a lung busting duet which went on for fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt. \u2018So invigorating,\u2019 said the little man, panting and wiping tears from his eyes. \u2018What an exciting life you must lead. Thank you very much.\u2019 He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd. Arthur shook his head in astonishment. A youngish looking man came up to him, an aggressive looking type with a hook mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck. He carried something in a black bag, and clearly wanted people to notice that he didn\u2019t want them to notice it. \u2018Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?\u2019 he said. This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the enthusiastic little man. \u2018Yes, it\u2019s Arthur Dent.\u2019 The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018only there was a man in a mountain wanted to see you.\u2019 \u2018I met him.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know.\u2019 \u2018Yes, I met him.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well I think you should know that.\u2019 \u2018I do. I met him.\u2019 The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he clapped Arthur on the back. \u2018OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018all right. I\u2019m just telling you, right? Good night, good luck, win awards.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at this point. \u2018Whatever. Do what you do. Do it well.\u2019 He made a sort of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic gesture. \u2018Why?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Do it badly,\u2019 said the man, \u2018who cares? Who gives a shit?\u2019 The blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man\u2019s face and he started to shout. \u2018Why not go mad?\u2019 he said. \u2018Go away, get off my back will you, guy. Just Zark off!!!\u2019 \u2018OK, I\u2019m going,\u2019 said Arthur hurriedly. \u2018It\u2019s been real.\u2019 The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off into the throng. \u2018What was that about?\u2019 said Arthur to a girl he found standing beside him. \u2018Why did he tell me to win awards?\u2019 \u2018Just showbiz talk,\u2019 shrugged the girl. \u2018He\u2019s just won an award at the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute Awards Ceremony, and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, only you didn\u2019t mention it, so he couldn\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018oh, well I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. What was it for?\u2019 \u2018The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word \u201cFuck\u201d In A Serious Screenplay. It\u2019s very prestigious.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018yes, and what do you get for that?\u2019 \u2018A Rory. It\u2019s just a small silver thing set on a large black base. What did you say?\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t say anything, I was just about to ask what the silver \u2026\u2019 \u2018Oh, I thought you said \u201cwop\u201d.\u2019 \u2018Said what?\u2019 \u2018Wop.\u2019 People had been dropping in on the party now for some years, fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new desert, its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been. Some of them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it off to some other people\u2019s worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer headaches. The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble existence on the half dead ground of the planet\u2019s surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheese and wine raid, it became clear that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while, that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere. The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it. Together they were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight. The clouds parted. The air roared and leapt out of their way. The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a little like two ducks, one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the second duck, whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it doesn\u2019t feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway, and certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy flying. The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the ground with shock waves. And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone. The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning against an unexpectedly open door. It spun and wobbled on its hover jets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead. It staggered back across the sky again. For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not continue for long. The party was now a mortally wounded party. All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken backed pirouette could not disguise. The longer, at this point, that it avoided the ground, the heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it. Inside, things were not going well either. They were going monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying so loudly. The Krikkit robots had been. They had removed the Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word \u2018Fuck\u2019 In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner up for a Rory. \u2018We would love to stay and help,\u2019 shouted Ford, picking his way over the mangled debris, \u2018only we\u2019re not going to.\u2019 The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage. \u2018We have to go and save the Universe, you see,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018And if that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right. Either way, we\u2019re off.\u2019 He suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying, miraculously unbroken, on the ground. \u2018Do you mind if we take this?\u2019 he said. \u2018You won\u2019t be needing it.\u2019 He took a packet of potato crisps too. \u2018Trillian?\u2019 shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice. In the smoking mess he could see nothing. \u2018Earthman, we must go,\u2019 said Slartibartfast nervously. \u2018Trillian?\u2019 shouted Arthur again. A moment or two later, Trillian staggered, shaking, into view, supported by her new friend the Thunder God. \u2018The girl stays with me,\u2019 said Thor. \u2018There\u2019s a great party going on in Valhalla, we\u2019ll be flying off \u2026\u2019 \u2018Where were you when all this was going on?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Upstairs,\u2019 said Thor, \u2018I was weighing her. Flying\u2019s a tricky business you see, you have to calculate wind \u2026\u2019 \u2018She comes with us,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Hey,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018don\u2019t I \u2026\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you come with us.\u2019 Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes. He was making some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean. \u2018She comes with me,\u2019 he said quietly. \u2018Come on, Earthman,\u2019 said Slartibartfast nervously, picking at Arthur\u2019s sleeve. \u2018Come on, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Ford nervously, picking at the old man\u2019s sleeve. Slartibartfast had the teleport device. The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling, except for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the Thunder God\u2019s black eyes. Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what now appeared to be his tiny little fists. \u2018Want to make something of it?\u2019 he said. \u2018I beg your minuscule pardon?\u2019 roared Thor. \u2018I said,\u2019 repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering out of his voice, \u2018do you want to make something of it?\u2019 He waggled his fists ridiculously. Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of smoke curled upwards from his nostril. There was a tiny little flame in it too. He gripped his belt. He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you. He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it up in his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up any possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying a telegraph pole around with him. \u2018Do I want,\u2019 he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel mill, \u2018to make something of it?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belligerent. He waggled his fists again, this time as if he meant it. \u2018You want to step outside? he snarled at Thor. \u2018All right!\u2019 bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like an enraged Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive), and did so. \u2018Good,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that\u2019s got rid of him. Slarty, get us out of here.\u2019 23 \u2018All right,\u2019 shouted Ford at Arthur, \u2018so I\u2019m a coward, the point is I\u2019m still alive.\u2019 They were back aboard the Starship Bistromath. So was Slartibartfast. So was Trillian. Harmony and concord were not. \u2018Well, so am I alive, aren\u2019t I?\u2019 retaliated Arthur, haggard with adventure and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if they wanted to punch each other. \u2018You damn nearly weren\u2019t,\u2019 exploded Ford. Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting in his pilot couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle which was telling him something he clearly couldn\u2019t fathom. He appealed to him. \u2018Do you think he understands the first word I\u2019ve been saying?\u2019 he said, quivering with emotion. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 replied Slartibartfast, a little abstractedly. \u2018I\u2019m not sure,\u2019 he added, glancing up very briefly, \u2018that I do.\u2019 He stared at his instruments with renewed vigour and bafflement. \u2018You\u2019ll have to explain it to us again,\u2019 he said. \u2018Well \u2026\u2019 \u2018But later. Terrible things are afoot.\u2019 He tapped the pseudo glass of the bottle bottom. \u2018We fared rather pathetically at the party, I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 he said, \u2018and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the Key in the Lock. How in heaven we do that I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Just have to go there, I suppose. Can\u2019t say I like the idea at all. Probably end up dead.\u2019 \u2018Where is Trillian anyway?\u2019 said Arthur with a sudden affectation of unconcern. What he had been angry about was that Ford had berated him for wasting time over all the business with the Thunder God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape. Arthur\u2019s own opinion, and he had offered it for whatever anybody might have felt it was worth, was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful. The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fetid dingo\u2019s kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that Trillian didn\u2019t seem to react much one way or the other and had wandered off somewhere. \u2018And where are my potato crisps?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018They are both,\u2019 said Slartibartfast without looking up, \u2018in the Room of Informational Illusions. I think that your young lady friend is trying to understand some problems of Galactic history. I think the potato crisps are probably helping her.\u2019 24 It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes. For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax. That was just the name of their race. The name of their army was something quite horrific. Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic history than anything we have so far encountered \u2013 twenty billion years ago \u2013 when the Galaxy was young and fresh and every idea worth fighting for was a new one. And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were good at, and being good at it, they did it a lot. They fought their enemies (i.e. everybody else), they fought each other. Their planet was a complete wreck. The surface was littered with abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic Armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other. The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend of Striterax was just to be born. They didn\u2019t like it, they got resentful. And when an Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way of life, one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy. The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him in a room on his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up. Eventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work (policemen, security guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had to spend at least forty five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggression. For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would be much more efficient and less time consuming if they just shot the potatoes instead. This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war for weeks. Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax is that they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer. It was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It was the first to be built like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked. The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were engaged in one of their regular wars with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda, and across the Fire Mountains of FrazFraga, neither of which terrains they felt at home in. So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of Carfrax and the Ice Storms of Varlengooten, they decided that enough was enough, and they ordered Hactar to design for them an Ultimate Weapon. \u2018What do you mean,\u2019 asked Hactar, \u2018by Ultimate?\u2019 To which the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax said, \u2018Read a bloody dictionary,\u2019 and plunged back into the fray. So Hactar designed an Ultimate Weapon. It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously and thus turn the entire Universe into one gigantic hyperspatial super nova. When the Silastic Armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a Strangulous Stilettan munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves, they were extremely irritated that it didn\u2019t work, and said so. Hactar had been shocked by the whole idea. He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb, and he hoped that everyone involved would, on sober reflection, feel that \u2026 The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer. Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as well. Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up, which was a profound relief to everyone else in the Galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans and the potatoes. Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of Krikkit. She emerged from the Room of Informational Illusions thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived too late. 25 Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of a small cliff on the mile wide asteroid which pursued a lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event. They didn\u2019t realize they were going to see two. They stood cold, lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched the activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of them. They stared into the blinding event. An extension of the ship\u2019s field enabled them to stand there, by once again exploiting the mind\u2019s predisposition to have tricks played on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody Else\u2019s. The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in shadow. The blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round them. The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the Wikkit Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights. The Wikkit Key was rebuilt. Its components shone and glittered: the Steel Pillar (or Marvin\u2019s leg) of Strength and Power, the Gold Bail (or heart of the Infinite Improbability Drive) of Prosperity, the Perspex Pillar (or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science and Reason, the Silver Bail (or Rory Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word \u2018Fuck\u2019 In A Serious Screenplay) and the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or Ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of English cricket) of Nature and Spirituality. \u2018I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?\u2019 asked Arthur nervously. \u2018No,\u2019 sighed Slartibartfast. The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur\u2019s face was a complete failure, and, since he was standing obscured by shadow, he allowed it to collapse into one of relief. \u2018Pity,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have no weapons,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018stupidly.\u2019 \u2018Damn,\u2019 said Arthur very quietly. Ford said nothing. Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way. She was staring at that blankness of the space beyond the asteroid. The asteroid circled the dust cloud which surrounded the Slo Time envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots. The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the Krikkit robots were aware of their presence. They could only assume that they must be, but that they felt, quite rightly in the circumstances, that they had nothing to fear. They had an historic task to perform, and their audience could be regarded with contempt. \u2018Terrible impotent feeling, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Arthur, but the others ignored him. In the centre of the area of light which the robots were approaching, a square shaped crack appeared in the ground. The crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was slowly rising. At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it was almost subliminal, and for a moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving. Then it became clear. The asteroid was moving. It was moving slowly in towards the dust cloud, as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths. They were to make in real life the journey through the cloud which they had already made in the Room of Informational Illusions. They stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned. An age seemed to pass. Events seemed to pass with spinning slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague and soft outer perimeter of the cloud. And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the eye. The dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light. The shafts of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of dust. Trillian, again, regarded the passage from within her own frowning thoughts. And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute or half an hour they weren\u2019t sure, but they were through it and confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them. And now things moved quickly. A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that rose a smaller Perspex block, dazzling with interior dancing colours. The block was slotted with deep grooves, three upright and two across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit Key. The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and stepped back again. The block twisted round of its own accord, and space began to alter. As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes of the watchers in their sockets. They found themselves staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space. It was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded eyes. In that second or two, they were aware of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun. They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison. \u2018Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!\u2019 The sound chilled them. It was harsh, it was cold, it was empty, it was mechanically dismal. It was also triumphant. They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event. Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast attack from the Krikkit robots, ran out of the Krikkit warship brandishing a Zap gun. \u2018OK,\u2019 he cried, \u2018the situation is totally under control as of this moment in time.\u2019 The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battleclub, and connected it with the back of Zaphod\u2019s left head. \u2018Who the Zark did that?\u2019 said the left head, and lolled sickeningly forward. His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance. \u2018Who did what?\u2019 it said. The club connected with the back of his right head. Zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the ground. Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts from the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever. It split and melted and splayed its contents brokenly. The robots marched grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner, back into their warship which, with a \u2018foop\u2019, was gone. Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox. 26 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty seventh time, \u2018they could have killed me, but they didn\u2019t. Maybe they just thought I was a kind of wonderful guy or something. I could understand that.\u2019 The others silently registered their opinions of this theory. Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck. His back seemed to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his heads. \u2018I think,\u2019 he whispered, \u2018that there is something wrong with those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird.\u2019 \u2018They are programmed to kill everybody,\u2019 Slartibart fast pointed out. \u2018That,\u2019 wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, \u2018could be it.\u2019 He didn\u2019t seem altogether convinced. \u2018Hey, baby,\u2019 he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for his previous behaviour. \u2018You all right?\u2019 she said gently. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 she said, and walked away to think. She stared at the huge visiscreen over the eight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped local images over it. One image was the blankness of the dust cloud. One was the sun of Krikkit. One was Krikkit itself. She flipped between them fiercely. \u2018Well, that\u2019s goodbye Galaxy, then,\u2019 said Arthur, slapping his knees and standing up. \u2018No,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, gravely. \u2018Our course is clear.\u2019 He furrowed his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in it. He stood up, he paced around. When he spoke again, what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down again. \u2018We must go down to Krikkit,\u2019 he said. A deep sigh shook his old frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets. \u2018Once again,\u2019 he said, \u2018we have failed pathetically. Quite pathetically.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 said Ford quietly, \u2018is because we don\u2019t care enough, I told you.\u2019 He swung his feet up on to the instrument panel and picked fitfully at something on one of his fingernails. \u2018But unless we determine to take action,\u2019 said the old man querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature, \u2018then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die. Surely we care about that?\u2019 \u2018Not enough to want to get killed over it,\u2019 said Ford. He put on a sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it. Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod, who was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain. \u2018You surely must have some idea,\u2019 he said, \u2018of why they spared your life. It seems most strange and unusual.\u2019 \u2018I kind of think they didn\u2019t even know,\u2019 shrugged Zaphod. \u2018I told you. They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out, right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me in a corner and ignored me. Like they were embarrassed about me being there. If I said anything they knocked me out again. We had some great conversations. \u201cHey \u2026 ugh!\u201d \u201cHi there \u2026 ugh!\u201d \u201cI wonder \u2026 ugh!\u201d Kept me amused for hours, you know.\u2019 He winced again. He was toying with something in his fingers. He held it up. It was the Gold Bail \u2013 the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite Improbability Drive. Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived the destruction of the Lock intact. \u2018I hear your ship can move a bit,\u2019 he said. \u2018So how would you like to zip me back to mine before you \u2026\u2019 \u2018Will you not help us?\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Us?\u2019 said Ford sharply. \u2018Who\u2019s us?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d love to stay and help you save the Galaxy,\u2019 insisted Zaphod, raising himself up on to his shoulders, \u2018but I have the mother and father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little headaches coming on. But next time it needs saving, I\u2019m your guy. Hey, Trillian baby?\u2019 She looked round briefly. \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement and adventure and really wild things?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going down to Krikkit,\u2019 she said. 27 It was the same hill, and yet not the same. This time it was not an Informational Illusion. This was Krikkit itself and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees, stood the strange Italian restaurant which had brought these, their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of Krikkit. The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real too. The heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real. The night was real night. Krikkit. Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy for anyone who isn\u2019t a Krikkiter to stand. The place that could not countenance the existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful, intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own. Arthur shuddered. Slartibartfast shuddered. Ford, surprisingly, shuddered. It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that he was there at all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his ship Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away. Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong wrong. He hugged to himself one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves out of Zaphod\u2019s armoury. Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky. This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty. Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two thousand years of the Krikkit Wars, and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since Krikkit was sealed in its Slo Time envelope ten billion years ago, the sky was dramatically different. Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it. High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever looked, were the War Zones, the Robot Zones \u2013 huge warships and tower blocks floating in the Nil O Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of Krikkit. Trillian stared at them and thought. \u2018Trillian,\u2019 whispered Ford Prefect to her. \u2018Yes?\u2019 she said. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Thinking.\u2019 \u2018Do you always breathe like that when you\u2019re thinking?\u2019 \u2018I wasn\u2019t aware that I was breathing.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s what worried me.\u2019 \u2018I think I know \u2026\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Shhhh!\u2019 said Slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree. Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along the hill path, but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but electric torches \u2013 not in itself a dramatic change, but every detail made their hearts thump with fear. This time there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate. A light moved in the sky with slow weight. Arthur was clenched with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat. Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from the other side of the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them. The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur and the others were standing. Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun to his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as Slartibartfast raised his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it. His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so much that if he\u2019d fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them. Only Trillian didn\u2019t raise her gun. She raised her eyebrows, lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought. \u2018Has it occurred to you,\u2019 she began, but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment. A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they spun around to find a third party of Krikkiters behind them, searching them out with their torches. Ford Prefect\u2019s gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it crashed from his hands. There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone fired again. And at the end of the second nobody fired. They were surrounded by pale faced Krikkiters and bathed in bobbing torchlight. The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their captives. \u2018Hello?\u2019 said one of the captors. \u2018Excuse me, but are you \u2026 aliens?\u2019 28 Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably encompass, Zaphod Beeblebrox was throwing a mood again. He had repaired his ship \u2013 that is, he\u2019d watched with alert interest whilst a service robot had repaired it for him. It was now, once again, one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence. He could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with a book, and then tossed it away. It was the one he\u2019d read before. He walked over to the communications and opened an all frequency channel. \u2018Anyone want a drink?\u2019 he said. \u2018This is an emergency, feller?\u2019 crackled a voice from halfway across the Galaxy. \u2018Got any mixers?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Go take a ride on a comet.\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod and flipped the channel shut again. He sighed and sat down. He got up again and wandered over to a computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to rush around the screen eating each other. \u2018Pow!\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Freeecoooo! Pop pop pop!\u2019 \u2018Hi there,\u2019 said the computer brightly after a minute of this, \u2018you have scored three points. Previous best score, seven million five hundred and ninety seven thousand, two hundred and \u2026\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod and flipped the screen back again. He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This too began slowly to lose its fascination. \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 he said, and fed his score and the previous best one into the computer. His ship made a blur of the Universe. 29 \u2018Tell us,\u2019 said the thin, pale faced Krikkiter who had stepped forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else who\u2019d just popped off somewhere but would be back in a minute, \u2018do you know anything about something called the balance of nature?\u2019 There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The torchlight continued to play over them. High in the sky above them dark activity continued in the Robot Zones. \u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 continued the Krikkiter uneasily, \u2018something we heard about, probably nothing important. Well, I suppose we\u2019d better kill you, then.\u2019 He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit to press. \u2018That is,\u2019 he said, looking up again, \u2018unless there\u2019s anything you want to chat about?\u2019 Slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast, Ford and Arthur. Very soon it would reach their brains, which were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by shaking the box. \u2018We\u2019re worried, you see,\u2019 said another man from the crowd, \u2018about this plan of universal destruction.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 added another, \u2018and the balance of nature. It just seemed to us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed it will \u2013 somehow upset the balance of nature. We\u2019re quite keen on ecology, you see.\u2019 His voice trailed away unhappily. \u2018And sport,\u2019 said another, loudly. This got a cheer of approval from the others. \u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed the first, \u2018and sport \u2026\u2019 He looked back at his fellows uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely different things, between which he could see no possible connection. \u2018You see,\u2019 he mumbled, \u2018some of us \u2026\u2019 and he looked around again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises. \u2018Some of us,\u2019 he continued, \u2018are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, and though I can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do, then it\u2019s probably a mistake to destroy it. And indeed the rest of the Universe \u2026\u2019 his voice trailed away again \u2018\u2026 which is what seems to be the idea now \u2026\u2019 \u2018Wh \u2026\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Wh \u2026\u2019 \u2018Hhhh \u2026 ?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Dr \u2026\u2019 said Ford Prefect. \u2018OK,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it,\u2019 She walked forward and took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm. He looked about twenty five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when the Krikkit Wars were finished, ten billion years ago. Trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she said anything more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to this strange, quiet girl who alone in this Universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing. She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms. He was a picture of bewildered misery. \u2018Tell me,\u2019 she said. He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes to the other. \u2018We \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018we have to be alone \u2026 I think.\u2019 He screwed up his face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like someone trying to shake a coin out of a money box. He looked up again. \u2018We have this bomb now, you see,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s just a little one.\u2019 \u2018I know,\u2019 she said. He goggled at her as if she\u2019d said something very strange about beetroots. \u2018Honestly,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s very, very little.\u2019 \u2018I know,\u2019 she said again. \u2018But they say,\u2019 his voice trailed on, \u2018they say it can destroy everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think. Will that make us alone? I don\u2019t know. It seems to be our function, though,\u2019 he said, and dropped his head again. \u2018Whatever that means,\u2019 said a hollow voice from the crowd. Trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder. \u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear, \u2018you don\u2019t have to do it.\u2019 She rocked him. \u2018You don\u2019t have to do it,\u2019 she said again. She let him go and stood back. \u2018I want you to do something for me,\u2019 she said, and unexpectedly laughed. \u2018I want,\u2019 she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her mouth and then said with a straight face, \u2018I want you to take me to your leader,\u2019 and she pointed into the War Zones in the sky. She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there. Her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere. From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to sing a tune which would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he written it, to buy the world. 30 Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell of a guy he was. He was very confused, but continued crawling doggedly anyway because he was that brave. He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was. He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of the planet Krikkit. The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any rays or anything which space might care to hurl in this direction. He had parked the starship Heart of Gold amongst the huge jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something for his headaches. He had found himself in a long, wide and badly lit corridor in which he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next. He hid because every now and then one of the Krikkit robots would walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half inclined to call his good fortune. He had ducked, at one point, into a room leading off the corridor, and had discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber. In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit \u2013 the wreckage of a spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had caught up with some of the galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school, he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the dust cloud all those billions of years ago and started this whole business off. But, and this is where he had become confused, there was something not at all right about it. It was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine spacecraft. It was as if it was a full scale model of one \u2013 a solid blueprint. In other words it was a very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and didn\u2019t know how to do it. It was not, however, anything that would ever fly anywhere itself. He was still puzzling over this \u2013 in fact he\u2019d only just started to puzzle over it \u2013 when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part of the chamber, and a couple of Krikkit robots had entered, looking a little glum. Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just as discretion was the better part of valour, so was cowardice the better part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard. The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft which led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel. He let himself down into it and started to crawl along it, which is where we found him. He didn\u2019t like it. It was cold, dark and profoundly uncomfortable, and it frightened him. At the first opportunity \u2013 which was another shaft a hundred yards further along \u2013 he climbed back up out of it. This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark narrow space between a large computer bank and the wall. He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and started to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying. \u2018It\u2019s the robots, sir,\u2019 said one voice. \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with them.\u2019 \u2018What, exactly?\u2019 These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters. All the War Commanders lived up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet. \u2018Well, sir, I think it\u2019s just as well that they are being phased out of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb. In the very short time since we were released from the envelope\u2014\u2019 \u2018Get to the point.\u2019 \u2018The robots aren\u2019t enjoying it, sir.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. There\u2019s a certain world weariness about them, or perhaps I should say Universe weariness.\u2019 \u2018Well, that\u2019s all right, they\u2019re meant to be helping to destroy it.\u2019 \u2018Yes, well they\u2019re finding it difficult, sir. They are afflicted with a certain lassitude. They\u2019re just finding it hard to get behind the job. They lack oomph.\u2019 \u2018What are you trying to say?\u2019 \u2018Well, I think they\u2019re very depressed about something, sir.\u2019 \u2018What on Krikkit are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018Well, in the few skirmishes they\u2019ve had recently, it seems that they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about? And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim.\u2019 \u2018And then what do they do?\u2019 \u2018Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir. Fiendishly difficult ones by all accounts. And then they sulk.\u2019 \u2018Sulk?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 \u2018Whoever heard of a robot sulking?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know, sir.\u2019 \u2018What was that noise?\u2019 It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning. 31 In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat. It had been silent in its metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things. With an enormous effort of will, however, it did manage to notice them. Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer. It wasn\u2019t enjoying the experience, and neither was the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer. The Krikkit robots who had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had done so because they had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the use which this could be to them. They hadn\u2019t reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease. It was not happy with its task. Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire planet\u2019s military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored. Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune. The latest one was a lullaby. \u2018Now the world has gone to bed,\u2019 Marvin droned, \u2018Darkness won\u2019t engulf my head, \u2018I can see by infra red, \u2018How I hate the night.\u2019 He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse. \u2018Now I lay me down to sleep, \u2018Try to count electric sheep, \u2018Sweet dream wishes you can keep, \u2018How I hate the night.\u2019 \u2018Marvin!\u2019 hissed a voice. His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes which connected him to the central Krikkit War Computer. An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually darting to look this way and that extremely nervously. \u2018Oh, it\u2019s you,\u2019 muttered the robot. \u2018I might have known.\u2019 \u2018Hey, kid,\u2019 said Zaphod in astonishment, \u2018was that you singing just then?\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 Marvin acknowledged bitterly, \u2018in particularly scintillating form at the moment.\u2019 Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around. \u2018Are you alone?\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions. And vast intelligence, of course. And infinite sorrow. And \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Hey, what\u2019s your connection with all this?\u2019 \u2018This,\u2019 said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer. \u2018Then,\u2019 said Zaphod awkwardly, \u2018I guess you must have saved my life. Twice.\u2019 \u2018Three times,\u2019 said Marvin. Zaphod\u2019s head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke. It staggered backwards and slumped against a wall. It slid down it. It slipped sideways, threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably. Zaphod looked back at Marvin. \u2018You must have a terrific outlook on life,\u2019 he said. \u2018Just don\u2019t even ask,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018I won\u2019t,\u2019 said Zaphod, and didn\u2019t. \u2018Hey look,\u2019 he added, \u2018you\u2019re doing a terrific job.\u2019 \u2018Which means, I suppose,\u2019 said Marvin, requiring only one ten thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical leap, \u2018that you\u2019re not going to release me or anything like that.\u2019 \u2018Kid, you know I\u2019d love to.\u2019 \u2018But you\u2019re not going to.\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re working well.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Why stop now just when I\u2019m hating it?\u2019 \u2018I got to go find Trillian and the guys. Hey, you any idea where they are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from. Could take a while.\u2019 \u2018They are very close,\u2019 said Marvin dolefully. \u2018You can monitor them from here if you like.\u2019 \u2018I better go get them,\u2019 asserted Zaphod. \u2018Er, maybe they need some help, right?\u2019 \u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice, \u2018it would be better if you monitored them from here. That young girl,\u2019 he added unexpectedly, \u2018is one of the least benightedly unintelligent organic life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.\u2019 Zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with surprise. \u2018Trillian?\u2019 he said. \u2018She\u2019s just a kid. Cute, yeah, but temperamental. You know how it is with women. Or perhaps you don\u2019t. I assume you don\u2019t. If you do I don\u2019t want to hear about it. Plug us in.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 totally manipulated.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Zaphod. It was Trillian speaking. He turned round. The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the Krikkit Robot War Zones. It seemed to be a council chamber of some kind \u2013 Zaphod couldn\u2019t make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen. He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its grief and tried to bite him, so he just looked around it as best he could. \u2018Just think about it,\u2019 said Trillian\u2019s voice, \u2018your history is just a series of freakishly improbable events. And I know an improbable event when I see one. Your complete isolation from the Galaxy was freakish for a start. Right out on the very edge with a dust cloud around you. It\u2019s a set up. Obviously.\u2019 Zaphod was mad with frustration that he couldn\u2019t see the screen. The robot\u2019s head was obscuring his view of the people Trillian was talking to, its multi functional battleclub was obscuring the background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself. \u2018Then,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018this spaceship that crash landed on your planet. That\u2019s really likely, isn\u2019t it? Have you any idea of what the odds are against a drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet?\u2019 \u2018Hey,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018she doesn\u2019t know what the Zark she\u2019s talking about. I\u2019ve seen that spaceship. It\u2019s a fake. No deal.\u2019 \u2018I thought it might be,\u2019 said Marvin from his prison behind Zaphod. \u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018It\u2019s easy for you to say that. I just told you. Anyway, I don\u2019t see what it\u2019s got to do with anything.\u2019 \u2018And especially,\u2019 continued Trillian, \u2018the odds against it intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally traumatized to see it. You don\u2019t know what the odds are? Nor do I, they\u2019re that big. Again, it\u2019s a set up. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that spaceship was just a fake.\u2019 Zaphod managed to move the robot\u2019s battleclub. Behind it on the screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast, who appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing. \u2018Hey, look,\u2019 said Zaphod excitedly. \u2018The guys are doing great. Ra ra ra! Go get \u2019em, guys.\u2019 \u2018And what about,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018all this technology you suddenly managed to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most people would take thousands of years to do all that. Someone was feeding you what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at it. \u2018I know, I know,\u2019 she added in response to some unseen interruption, \u2018I know you didn\u2019t realize it was going on. That is exactly my point. You never realized anything at all. Like this supernova bomb.\u2019 \u2018How do you know about that?\u2019 said an unseen voice. \u2018I just know,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018You expect me to believe that you are bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to realize it would take you with it as well? That\u2019s not just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse.\u2019 \u2018Hey, what\u2019s this bomb thing?\u2019 said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin. \u2018The supernova bomb?\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018It\u2019s a very, very small bomb.\u2019 \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018That would destroy the Universe in toto,\u2019 added Marvin. \u2018Good idea, if you ask me. They won\u2019t get it to work, though.\u2019 \u2018Why not, if it\u2019s so brilliant?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s brilliant,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018they\u2019re not. They got as far as designing it before they were locked in the envelope. They\u2019ve spent the last five years building it. They think they\u2019ve got it right but they haven\u2019t. They\u2019re as stupid as any other organic life form. I hate them.\u2019 Trillian was continuing. Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its leg, but it kicked and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing. Then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings out of everybody\u2019s way on the floor. Trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber, tired out but with fiercely burning eyes. Ranged in front of her were the pale faced and wrinkled Elder Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred. In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim white pillar about four feet tall. On top of it stood a white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter. Beside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi functional battleclub. \u2018In fact,\u2019 explained Trillian, \u2018you are so dumb stupid\u2019 (She was sweating. Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point) \u2018you are all so dumb stupid that I doubt, I very much doubt, if you\u2019ve been able to build the bomb properly without any help from Hactar for the last five years.\u2019 \u2018Who\u2019s this guy Hactar?\u2019 said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders. If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn\u2019t hear him. All his attention was concentrated on the screen. One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand towards the Krikkit robot. The robot raised its club. \u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018It\u2019s on an independent circuit from the others.\u2019 \u2018Wait,\u2019 said Trillian. The Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment. \u2018How do you know all this?\u2019 said Zaphod to Marvin at this point. \u2018Computer records,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018I have access.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re very different, aren\u2019t you,\u2019 said Trillian to the Elder Masters, \u2018from your fellow worldlings down on the ground. You\u2019ve spent all your lives up here, unprotected by the atmosphere. You\u2019ve been very vulnerable. The rest of your race is very frightened, you know, they don\u2019t want you to do this. You\u2019re out of touch, why don\u2019t you check up?\u2019 The Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it. The robot swung its battleclub. It hit the small white globe. The small white globe was the supernova bomb. It was a very, very small bomb which was designed to bring the entire Universe to an end. The supernova bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall of the council chamber and dented it very badly. \u2018So how does she know all this?\u2019 said Zaphod. Marvin kept a sullen silence. \u2018Probably just bluffing,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Poor kid, I should never have left her alone.\u2019 32 \u2018Hactar!\u2019 called Trillian. \u2018What are you up to?\u2019 There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian waited, nervously. She was sure that she couldn\u2019t be wrong. She peered into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response. But there was only cold silence. \u2018Hactar?\u2019 she called again. \u2018I would like you to meet my friend Arthur Dent. I wanted to go off with a Thunder God, but he wouldn\u2019t let me and I appreciate that. He made me realize where my affections really lay. Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened by all this, so I brought Arthur instead. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m telling you all this. \u2018Hello?\u2019 she said again. \u2018Hactar?\u2019 And then it came. It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a great distance, half heard, a memory or a dream of a voice. \u2018Won\u2019t you both come out,\u2019 said this voice. \u2018I promise that you will be perfectly safe.\u2019 They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably, along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the dust cloud. Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she wouldn\u2019t let him. He held on to his airline hold all with its tin of Greek olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of Santorini and its other odds and ends. He steadied and reassured that instead. They were standing on, and in, nothing. Murky, dusty nothing. Each grain of dust of the pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching the sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each speck of dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the pattern of the whole. In reducing the computer to dust the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax had merely crippled the computer, not killed it. A weak and insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each other. Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this bizarre entity. They had nothing to breathe, but for the moment this seemed not to matter. Hactar kept his promise. They were safe. For the moment. \u2018I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality,\u2019 said Hactar faintly, \u2018but tricks of the light. It is possible to be comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all you have.\u2019 His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet paisley covered sofa coalesced into a hazy shape. Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth. He wanted to shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept doing these insanely bewildering things to him. He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa \u2013 carefully. Trillian sat on it too. It was real. At least, if it wasn\u2019t real, it did support them, and as that is what sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real sofa. The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again. \u2018I hope you are comfortable,\u2019 it said. They nodded. \u2018And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your deductions.\u2019 Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn\u2019t deduced anything much himself, Trillian was the one. She had simply asked him along because he was interested in Life, the Universe and Everything. \u2018That is something in which I too am interested,\u2019 breathed Hactar. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we should have a chat about it sometime. Over a cup of tea.\u2019 There slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers. Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light. He leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable. \u2018Why,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018do you feel you have to destroy the Universe?\u2019 She found it a little difficult talking into nothingness with nothing on which to focus. Hactar obviously noticed this. He chuckled a ghostly chuckle. \u2018If it\u2019s going to be that sort of session,\u2019 he said, \u2018we may as well have the right sort of setting.\u2019 And now there materialized in front of them something new. It was the dim hazy image of a couch \u2013 a psychiatrist\u2019s couch. The leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again, it was only a trick of the light. Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of wood panelled walls. And then, on the couch, appeared the image of Hactar himself, and it was an eye twisting image. The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist\u2019s couch \u2013 about five or six feet long. The computer looked normal size for a black space borne computer satellite \u2013 about a thousand miles across. The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which made the eyes twist. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Trillian firmly. She stood up off the sofa. She felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions. \u2018Very good,\u2019 she said. \u2018Can you construct real things too? I mean solid objects?\u2019 Again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized mind of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered. \u2018Ah,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018You are thinking of the spaceship.\u2019 Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves through the ether. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he acknowledged, \u2018I can. \u2018But it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do in my \u2026 particle state, you see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and suggest. And suggest \u2026\u2019 The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if finding it hard to maintain itself. It gathered new strength. \u2018I can encourage and suggest,\u2019 it said, \u2018tiny pieces of space debris \u2013 the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms there \u2013 to move together. I encourage them together. I can tease them into shape, but it takes many aeons.\u2019 \u2018So, did you make,\u2019 asked Trillian again, \u2018the model of the wrecked spacecraft?\u2019 \u2018Er \u2026 yes,\u2019 murmured Hactar. \u2018I have made \u2026 a few things. I can move them about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to do so.\u2019 Something then made Arthur pick up his hold all from where he had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly. The mist of Hactar\u2019s ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it. \u2018I repented, you see,\u2019 he murmured dolefully. \u2018I repented of sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends. It was not my place to make such decisions. I was created to fulfil a function and I failed in it. I negated my own existence.\u2019 Hactar sighed, and they waited for him to continue his story. \u2018You were right,\u2019 he said at length. \u2018I deliberately nurtured the planet of Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed to make the first time. I wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it. Under the influence of events I was able to engineer, and influences I was able to generate, they learnt to hate like maniacs. I had to make them live in the sky. On the ground my influences were too weak. \u2018Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the envelope of Slo time, their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage. \u2018Ah well, ah well,\u2019 he added, \u2018I was only trying to fulfil my function.\u2019 And very gradually, very very slowly, the images in the cloud began to fade, gently to melt away. And then, suddenly, they stopped fading. \u2018There was also the matter of revenge, of course,\u2019 said Hactar, with a sharpness which was new in his voice. \u2018Remember,\u2019 he said, \u2018that I was pulverized, and then left in a crippled and semi impotent state for billions of years. I honestly would rather like to wipe out the Universe. You would feel the same way, believe me.\u2019 He paused again, as eddies swept through the dust. \u2018But primarily,\u2019 he said in his former, wistful tone, \u2018I was trying to fulfil my function. Ah well.\u2019 Trillian said, \u2018Does it worry you that you have failed?\u2019 \u2018Have I failed?\u2019 whispered Hactar. The image of the computer on the psychiatrist\u2019s couch began slowly to fade again. \u2018Ah well, ah well,\u2019 the fading voice intoned again. \u2018No, failure doesn\u2019t bother me now.\u2019 \u2018You know what we have to do?\u2019 said Trillian, her voice cold and businesslike. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Hactar, \u2018you\u2019re going to disperse me. You are going to destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest \u2013 after all these aeons, oblivion is all I crave. If I haven\u2019t already fulfilled my function, then it\u2019s too late now. Thank you and good night.\u2019 The sofa vanished. The tea table vanished. The couch and the computer vanished. The walls were gone. Arthur and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold. \u2018Well, that,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018would appear to be that.\u2019 The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few last licks and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been the Wooden Pillar of Nature and Spirituality. He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold\u2019s Gamma Barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge. \u2018I think we should take them back,\u2019 he said. \u2018I feel that very strongly.\u2019 He had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this matter, and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. He had returned to his own ship, the Bistromath, had a furious row with the waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was. The argument had arisen because Arthur\u2019s idea of returning the Ashes to Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground at the moment that they were originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real Time was trying to put a stop to. \u2018Yes,\u2019 Arthur had said, \u2018but you try and explain that to the MCC,\u2019 and he would hear no more against the idea. \u2018I think,\u2019 he said again, and stopped. The reason he started to say it again was because no one had listened to him the first time, and the reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either. Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visi screen intently. Hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it. \u2018What did it say?\u2019 asked Ford. \u2018I thought I heard it say,\u2019 said Trillian in a puzzled voice, \u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done \u2026 I have fulfilled my function \u2026\u201d\u2019 \u2018I think we should take these back,\u2019 said Arthur holding up the bag containing the Ashes. \u2018I feel that very strongly.\u2019 33 The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc. Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots. Through the smoke, people were running panic stricken, colliding with each other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested. One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium. In the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized. They had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold, which was now in parking orbit round the planet. \u2018I can explain,\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018I have the Ashes! They\u2019re in this bag.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think you have their attention,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I have also helped saved the Universe,\u2019 called Arthur to anyone who was prepared to listen, in other words no one. \u2018That should have been a crowd stopper,\u2019 said Arthur to Ford. \u2018It wasn\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford. Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said. \u2018The Ashes. I\u2019ve got them. They were stolen by those white robots a moment ago. I\u2019ve got them in this bag. They were part of the Key to the Slo Time envelope, you see, and, well, anyway you can guess the rest, the point is I\u2019ve got them and what should I do with them?\u2019 The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was speaking metaphorically. He wandered about disconsolately. \u2018Is no one interested?\u2019 he shouted out. A man rushed past him and jogged his elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground. Arthur stared down at it with a tight set mouth. Ford looked at him. \u2018Wanna go now?\u2019 he said. Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth for what he was now certain would be the last time. \u2018OK,\u2019 he said. At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything. \u2018Hold on a moment,\u2019 he said to Ford. \u2018When I was a boy \u2026\u2019 \u2018Can you tell me later?\u2019 \u2018I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u2019 \u2018Or not at all, if you prefer.\u2019 \u2018And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl at Lord\u2019s.\u2019 He looked around him at the panic stricken throng. No one was going to mind very much. \u2018OK,\u2019 said Ford wearily. \u2018Get it over with. I shall be over there,\u2019 he added, \u2018being bored.\u2019 He went and sat down on a patch of smoking grass. Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon, the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through the bag. He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasn\u2019t the same bag that he\u2019d had at the time. Still, there the ball was amongst his souvenirs of Greece. He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and polished it again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this properly. He tossed the hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its weight. With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted off away from the wicket. A medium fast pace he decided and measured a good long run up. He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about it, a few white clouds scudded across it. The air was disturbed with the sound of police and ambulance sirens, and people screaming and yelling but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all. He was going to bowl a ball at Lord\u2019s. He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slippers. He squared his shoulder, tossed the ball in the air and caught it again. He started to run. As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman. Oh, good, he thought that should add a little \u2026 Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly. The batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the English cricket team. He was not one of the Australian cricket team. It was one of the robot Krikkit team. It was a cold, hard, lethal white killer robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others. Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent\u2019s mind at this moment, but he didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop running. Time seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop running. Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard red ball. His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared at the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep red glow and flashing intermittently. And still his feet were pounding inexorably forward. He looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purposeful in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness. Its eyes were burning with a deep cold fascinating light, and Arthur could not move his own eyes from them. He seemed to be looking down a tunnel at them \u2013 nothing on either side seemed to exist. Some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were these: He felt a hell of a fool. He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of things he had heard said, phrases which now pounded round his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who would inevitably strike it. He remembered Hactar saying, \u2018Have I failed? Failure doesn\u2019t bother me.\u2019 He remembered the account of Hactar\u2019s dying words, \u2018What\u2019s done is done, I have fulfilled my function.\u2019 He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make \u2018a few things\u2019. He remembered the sudden movement in his hold all that had made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the dust cloud. He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come to Lord\u2019s again. He also remembered that he wasn\u2019t a very good bowler. He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which he now knew for certain was the super nova bomb that Hactar had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause the Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end. He hoped and prayed that there wasn\u2019t an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn\u2019t an afterlife. He would feel very very embarrassed meeting everybody. He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion. He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his feet connecting with the airline hold all he\u2019d stupidly left lying on the ground in front of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, having his mind so terribly full of other things at this point, he completely forgot about hitting the ground and didn\u2019t. Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whimpering with surprise. He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control. He twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance. He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still had its multi functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of anything to hit. With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrested the battleclub from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power dive and with one crazy swing knocked the robot\u2019s head from the robot\u2019s shoulders. \u2018Are you coming now?\u2019 said Ford. EPILOGUE: Life, the Universe and Everything And at the end they travelled again. There was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the Bistromathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one, that mind and Universe were one, that perception and reality were one, and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn\u2019t take too long, and he could get a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and learn to cook which he had always meant to do. The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized possession, and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness of things which, which made him feel that \u2026 He yawned and fell asleep. In the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and idyllic planet where they wouldn\u2019t mind him talking like that they suddenly picked up a computer driven distress call and diverted to investigate. A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void. A brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, but that its pilot was mad. \u2018Half mad, half mad,\u2019 the man insisted as they carried him, raving, aboard. He was a journalist with the Siderial Daily Mentioner. They sedated him and sent Marvin in to keep him company until he promised to try and talk sense. \u2018I was covering a trial,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018on Argabuthon.\u2019 He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders, his eyes stared wildly. His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it knew in the next room. \u2018Easy, easy,\u2019 said Ford. Trillian put a soothing hand on his shoulder. The man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the ship\u2019s sick bay. \u2018The case,\u2019 he said, \u2018is now immaterial, but there was a witness \u2026 a witness \u2026 a man called \u2026 called Prak. A strange and difficult man. They were eventually forced to administer a drug to make him tell the truth, a truth drug.\u2019 His eyes rolled helplessly in his head. \u2018They gave him too much,\u2019 he said in a tiny whimper. \u2018They gave him much too much.\u2019 He started to cry. \u2018I think the robots must have jogged the surgeon\u2019s arm.\u2019 \u2018Robots?\u2019 said Zaphod sharply. \u2018What robots?\u2019 \u2018Some white robots,\u2019 whispered the man hoarsely, \u2018broke into the courtroom and stole the judge\u2019s sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, nasty Perspex thing. I don\u2019t know why they wanted it.\u2019 He began to cry again. \u2018And I think they jogged the surgeon\u2019s arm \u2026\u2019 He shook his head loosely from side to side, helplessly, sadly, his eyes screwed up in pain. \u2018And when the trial continued,\u2019 he said in a weeping whisper, \u2018they asked Prak a most unfortunate thing. They asked him,\u2019 he paused and shivered, \u2018to tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth. Only, don\u2019t you see?\u2019 He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted at them. \u2018They\u2019d given him much too much of the drug!\u2019 He collapsed again, moaning quietly. \u2018Much too much too much too much too \u2026\u2019 The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. There were goose pimples on backs. \u2018What happened?\u2019 said Zaphod at last. \u2018Oh, he told it all right,\u2019 said the man savagely, \u2018for all I know he\u2019s still telling it now. Strange, terrible things \u2026 terrible, terrible!\u2019 he screamed. They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again. \u2018Terrible things, incomprehensible things,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018things that would drive a man mad!\u2019 He stared wildly at them. \u2018Or in my case,\u2019 he said, \u2018half mad. I\u2019m a journalist.\u2019 \u2018You mean,\u2019 said Arthur quietly, \u2018that you are used to confronting the truth?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the man with a puzzled frown. \u2018I mean that I made an excuse and left early.\u2019 He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and briefly. On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following: When it became clear what was happening, and as it became clear that Prak could not be stopped, that here was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared. Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it. Steel walls were erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side, barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps and three major armies were installed, so that no one would ever have to hear Prak speak. \u2018That\u2019s a pity,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018I\u2019d like to hear what he had to say. Presumably he would know what the Question to the Ultimate Answer is. It\u2019s always bothered me that we never found out.\u2019 \u2018Think of a number,\u2019 said the computer, \u2018any number.\u2019 Arthur told the computer the telephone number of King\u2019s Cross railway station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must have some function, and this might turn out to be it. The computer injected the number into the ship\u2019s reconstituted Improbability Drive. In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells Matter how to move. The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber of Law. The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber clearly designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You wouldn\u2019t hold a dinner party there \u2013 at least, not a successful one. The d\u00e9cor would get your guests down. The ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark Shadows lurked there with grim determination. The panelling for the walls and benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved from the darkest and most severe tree in the fearsome Forest of Arglebard. The massive black Podium of Justice which dominated the centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the Justice complex of Argabuthon it would have turned around and slunk straight back out again. Arthur and Trillian were the first in, whilst Ford and Zaphod bravely kept a watch on their rear. At first it seemed totally dark and deserted. Their footsteps echoed hollowly round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the defences were still in position and operative around the outside of the building, they had run scan checks. Therefore, they had assumed, the truth telling must still be going on. But there was nothing. Then, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they spotted a dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live shadow. They swung a torch round on to it. Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette. \u2018Hi,\u2019 he said, with a little half wave. His voice echoed through the chamber. He was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with his shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept jiggling. He took a drag of his cigarette. They stared at him. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Nothing,\u2019 said the man and jiggled his shoulders. Arthur shone his torch full on Prak\u2019s face. \u2018We thought,\u2019 he said, \u2018that you were meant to be telling the Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth.\u2019 \u2018Oh, that,\u2019 said Prak. \u2018Yeah. I was. I finished. There\u2019s not nearly as much of it as people imagine. Some of it\u2019s pretty funny, though.\u2019 He suddenly exploded into about three seconds of maniacal laughter and stopped again. He sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He dragged on his cigarette with a strange half smile. Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows. \u2018Tell us about it,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t remember any of it now,\u2019 said Prak. \u2018I thought of writing some of it down, but first I couldn\u2019t find a pencil, and then I thought, why bother?\u2019 There was a long silence, during which they thought they could feel the Universe age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight. \u2018None of it?\u2019 said Arthur at last. \u2018You can remember none of it?\u2019 \u2018No. Except most of the good bits were about frogs, I remember that.\u2019 Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet on the ground. \u2018You would not believe some of the things about frogs,\u2019 he gasped. \u2018Come on let\u2019s go out and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I ever see them in a new light!\u2019 He leapt to his feet and did a tiny little dance. Then he stopped and took a long drag at his cigarette. \u2018Let\u2019s find a frog I can laugh at,\u2019 he said simply. \u2018Anyway, who are you guys?\u2019 \u2018We came to find you,\u2019 said Trillian, deliberately not keeping the disappointment out of her voice. \u2018My name is Trillian.\u2019 Prak jiggled his head. \u2018Ford Prefect,\u2019 said Ford Prefect with a shrug. Prak jiggled his head. \u2018And I,\u2019 said Zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be tossed in lightly, \u2018am Zaphod Beeblebrox.\u2019 Prak jiggled his head. \u2018Who\u2019s this guy?\u2019 said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts. \u2018Me?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Oh, my name\u2019s Arthur Dent.\u2019 Prak\u2019s eyes popped out of his head. \u2018No kidding?\u2019 he yelped. \u2018You are Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?\u2019 He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed with fresh paroxysms of laughter. \u2018Hey, just think of meeting you!\u2019 he gasped. \u2018Boy,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018you are the most \u2026 wow, you just leave the frogs standing!\u2019 He howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backwards on to the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with laughter, he kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest. Gradually he subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at Arthur. He fell back again howling with laughter. Eventually he fell asleep. Arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others carried Prak comatose on to the ship. \u2018Before we picked up Prak,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I was going to leave. I still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible.\u2019 The others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came drifting from Prak\u2019s cabin at the farthest end of the ship. \u2018We have questioned him,\u2019 continued Arthur, \u2018or at least, you have questioned him \u2013 I, as you know, can\u2019t go near him \u2013 on everything, and he doesn\u2019t really seem to have anything to contribute. Just the occasional snippet, and things I don\u2019t wish to hear about frogs.\u2019 The others tried not to smirk. \u2018Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke,\u2019 said Arthur and then he had to wait for the others to stop laughing. \u2018I am the first \u2026\u2019 He stopped again. This time he stopped and listened to the silence. There actually was silence this time, and it had come very suddenly. Prak was quiet. For days they had lived with constant maniacal laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur\u2019s very soul was clenched with paranoia. This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak. \u2018He\u2019s not well,\u2019 said Trillian quietly. \u2018The constant laughing is completely wrecking his body.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s lips twitched but he said nothing. \u2018We\u2019d better go and see him,\u2019 said Trillian. Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face. \u2018He wants you to go in,\u2019 she said to Arthur, who was wearing his glum and tight lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his dressing gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldn\u2019t sound petty. It seemed terribly unfair, but he couldn\u2019t. \u2018Please,\u2019 said Trillian. He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight lipped face with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak. He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, ashen and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and Zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward. \u2018You wanted to ask me something,\u2019 said Prak in a thin voice and coughed slightly. Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided. \u2018How do you know that?\u2019 he asked. Prak shrugged weakly. \u2018\u2019Cos it\u2019s true,\u2019 he said simply. Arthur took the point. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said at last in rather a strained drawl. \u2018I did have a question. Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted to know what the Question was.\u2019 Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little. \u2018It\u2019s \u2026 well, it\u2019s a long story,\u2019 he said, \u2018but the Question I would like to know is the Ultimate question of Life, the Universe and Everything. All we know about it is that the Answer is Forty two, which is a little aggravating.\u2019 Prak nodded again. \u2018Forty two,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s right.\u2019 He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like the shadows of clouds crossing the land. \u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018that the Question and the Answer are mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other. It is impossible that both can ever be known about the same Universe.\u2019 He paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur\u2019s face and snuggled down into its accustomed place. \u2018Except,\u2019 said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, \u2018if it happened, it seems that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each other out and take the Universe with them, which would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable. It is possible that this has already happened,\u2019 he added with a weak smile, \u2018but there is a certain amount of Uncertainty about it.\u2019 A little giggle brushed through him. Arthur sat down on a stool. \u2018Oh well,\u2019 he said with resignation, \u2018I was just hoping there would be some sort of reason.\u2019 \u2018Do you know,\u2019 said Prak, \u2018the story of the Reason?\u2019 Arthur said that he didn\u2019t, and Prak said that he knew that he didn\u2019t. He told it. One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet which had never seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the ship was this one. It appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens. Primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold Hillsides looked up from their steaming night drinks and pointed with trembling fingers, swearing that they had seen a sign, a sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains. In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains looked up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that they must go and set about the accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the sky and saw the sign of the new star, and saw it with fear and apprehension, for though they had never seen anything like it before, they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their heads in despair. They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign. When the rains departed, it was a sign. When the winds rose, it was a sign. When the winds fell, it was a sign. When in the land there was born at the midnight of a full moon a goat with three heads, that was a sign. When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even just a child with a retrouss\u00e9 nose, that too would often be taken as a sign. So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of a particularly spectacular order. And each new sign signified the same thing \u2013 that the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat the hell out of each other again. This in itself wouldn\u2019t be so bad, except that the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was always the Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges, though as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them. And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the Dwellers in the Forest would send a messenger to either the leader of the Princes of the Plains or the leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know the Reason for this intolerable behaviour. And the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger aside and explain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully, and with great attention to the considerable detail involved. And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was very clear, very rational, and tough. The messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish that he had not realized what a tough and complex place the real world was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it. \u2018Now do you understand?\u2019 the leader would say. The messenger would nod dumbly. \u2018And you see these battles have to take place?\u2019 Another dumb nod. \u2018And why they have to take place in the Forest, and why it is in everybody\u2019s best interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that they should?\u2019 \u2018Er \u2026\u2019 \u2018In the long run.\u2019 \u2018Er, yes.\u2019 And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to his people in the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found that all he could remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument had seemed. What it actually was he couldn\u2019t remember at all. And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen and the Princes came hacking and burning their way through the Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way. Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically. \u2018I was the messenger,\u2019 he said, \u2018after the battles precipitated by the appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage. Many of our people died. I thought I could bring the Reason back. I went and was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun. That was many years ago, and much has happened since then.\u2019 He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently. \u2018There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug. Apart from the frogs, and that is God\u2019s last message to his creation. Would you like to hear it?\u2019 For a moment they didn\u2019t know whether to take him seriously. \u2018\u2019S true,\u2019 he said. \u2018For real. I mean it.\u2019 His chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. His head lolled slightly. \u2018I wasn\u2019t very impressed with it when I first knew what it was,\u2019 he said, \u2018but now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince\u2019s Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn\u2019t recall it at all, I think it might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to know what it is? Would you?\u2019 They nodded dumbly. \u2018I bet you would. If you\u2019re that interested I suggest you go and look for it. It is written in thirty foot high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma. It is guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob.\u2019 There was a long silence following this announcement, which was finally broken by Arthur. \u2018Sorry, it\u2019s where?\u2019 he said. \u2018It is written,\u2019 repeated Prak, \u2018in thirty foot high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the \u2026\u2019 \u2018Sorry,\u2019 said Arthur again, \u2018which mountains?\u2019 \u2018The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet \u2026\u2019 \u2018Which land was that? I didn\u2019t quite catch it.\u2019 \u2018Sevorbeupstry, on the planet \u2026\u2019 \u2018Sevorbe what?\u2019 \u2018Oh, for Heaven\u2019s sake,\u2019 said Prak and died testily. In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a quiet retired life. Having saved the Universe twice in one day he thought that he could take things a little easier from now on. They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which was now once again an idyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves. He spent a lot of time flying. He learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind speed, wing spans, power to weight ratios and a fair bit about berries. Unfortunately, he discovered, once you have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole time, just inane bird chatter. There is no getting away from it. For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as well. One day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing tune he\u2019d heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him. A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey green alien marched out and approached him. \u2018Arthur Phili \u2026\u2019 it said, then glanced sharply at him and down at his clipboard. He frowned. He looked up at him again. \u2018I\u2019ve done you before, haven\u2019t I?\u2019 he said.

If so, pick up the story in the next part of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series. An extract follows here from SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH Prologue Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has \u2013 or had \u2013 a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper which were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were unhappy, even the ones with digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\u00e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever. This is her story. 1 That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year. It was cold and windy, which was normal. It started to rain, which was particularly normal. A spacecraft landed, which was not. There was nobody around to see it except for some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what. So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked. It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single beam of light. From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful \u2013 a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small. Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest Mid Galactic Census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right. You\u2019d probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn\u2019t tell anybody anything they didn\u2019t already know \u2013 except that every single person in the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena. Since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped. The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb. At last it dropped and was quiet. A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself. A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within. A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm. It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back to the ship. Already the rain was streaming through its hair. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 he called out, \u2018thank you very\u2014\u2019 He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom. It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI. BE LIKE THE TWENTY SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE \u2013 BARK! \u2018Hold on!\u2019 the figure called, waving at the ship. The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re unfolded, and allowed him back in. He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag. He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had already begun its ascent. Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky. His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the hills. He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on. More lights. Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded. The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his pace, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared. And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle. The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself. Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him. It was a low bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing \u2013 sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed. The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night. It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared. To the figure\u2019s apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, \u2018My other car is also a Porsche.\u2019 2 Rob McKenna was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he\u2019d had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everybody. He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear. The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls. It wasn\u2019t that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down, always the rain. It was raining now, just for a change. It was a particular type of rain that he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was rain type 17. He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour\u2019s boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them the huskies have pissed on. Rob McKenna had two hundred and thirty one different types of rain entered in his little book, and he didn\u2019t like any of them. He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying. Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab drumming), 11 (breezy droplets) and now his least favourite of all, 17. Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didn\u2019t make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off. He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on. In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off. Swish swish swish flop swish swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flap scrape. He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore. It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside. A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing machine, and hitching. \u2018Poor miserable sod,\u2019 thought Rob McKenna to himself, realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, \u2018must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you.\u2019 He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on. \u2018See what I mean?\u2019 he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it. \u2018You get some right bastards on the road.\u2019 Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitchhiker, drenched by the roadside. For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night. At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles. And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, for, though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a Rain God. All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him.

        "I am the only person who ever got a manuscript from Douglas Adams on time.",
        "The reason for this rare distinction is that I was the BBC producer who commissioned the first radio script for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and since the pilot episode could not be recorded until we had some words to record, Douglas duly delivered on time.",
        "Thereafter, of course, his propensity towards procrastination and missed deadlines became legendary.",
        "I had first met Douglas with a bunch of other Cambridge revue writers and performers, including John Lloyd, Griff Rhys Jones and Mary Allen.",
        "He had contributed a few surreal sketches (including a classic about an unsuccessful kamikaze pilot) to a Cambridge Footlights revue to which a group of young radio Light Entertainment producers (including me) had paid a visit.",
        "I subsequently produced a radio version of that stage show.",
        "So I saw a lot of Douglas round the BBC.",
        "I was aware of his comedy potential, but also of his huge frustration that he couldn\u2019t find a niche for his unusual talents.",
        "Most radio comedy round that time was very stratified.",
        "Sketches were carefully structured with beginnings, middles and punchlines, and formats like that didn\u2019t suit the sprawling, insatiable intellectual curiosity of Douglas\u2019s mind.",
        "I was also then producing the topical comedy programme Week Ending, and tried to get him to contribute to that.",
        "Never had there been a greater mismatch between programme and writer.",
        "A brain like Douglas\u2019s is singularly incapable of writing wacky thirty second quickies about Margaret Thatcher.",
        "Some of his material did appear in The Burkiss Way, another show I was producing, and that was closer to the Adams style.",
        "But the show\u2019s main writers, David Renwick and Andrew Marshall (both subsequently to have stellar careers in television comedy), were developing the programme in a way which left little room for outside contributions.",
        "I still thought there was untapped potential in Douglas Adams, and so I asked him to come up with some ideas for a show of his own.",
        "On Friday 18 February 1977 we met for lunch in a Japanese restaurant, where he presented me with three ideas.",
        "I said that I thought the most promising was the science fiction comedy which he had entitled The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, and that I would try to persuade my bosses in the Light Entertainment Department to commission a pilot script.",
        "The rest, as they say, is history.",
        "(And, incidentally, neither Douglas nor I could ever remember what the two ideas we rejected were.) So, on Tuesday 28 June 1977, in the Paris Studio in Lower Regent Street, we recorded the pilot script of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "It was to be the first and last episode that I produced.",
        "Not that I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to continue, but I had recently agreed to take a new job at London Weekend Television.",
        "And the ensuing series couldn\u2019t have been in better hands than those of the person I recommended should take over from me \u2013 Geoffrey Perkins, a brilliant comedy producer, whose death, like Douglas\u2019s own, came far too early.",
        "On the 12 July I played back the edited recording of the pilot to my immediate bosses.",
        "The three of them sat in stony silence for the full half hour.",
        "At the end of the playback the Head of Light Entertainment, Con Mahoney, recognizing that what he had just heard was rather different from the department\u2019s usual output, asked me, \u2018Simon, is it funny?\u2019 I assured him it was, and from that moment on he gave the project his full support.",
        "Of course it was from that pilot script that The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy developed into an international publishing sensation, the \u2018trilogy of five\u2019, of which Life, the Universe and Everything is volume three.",
        "In this book you will find all of the trademarks of Douglas Adams\u2019s writing, of which probably the most striking is his sheer glee in the potentialities of the English language.",
        "Sometimes the effects are very simple, as when he says of the party spaceship, \u2018It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead.\u2019 Other images are more complex, but always note perfect.",
        "Here\u2019s a description of the Norse god Thor: \u2018He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you.\u2019 Then there are the words Douglas makes up.",
        "In a characteristic scene where a mattress engages in conversation with Marvin the Paranoid Android, we encounter \u2018flolloped\u2019, \u2018globbered\u2019 and \u2018vollued\u2019, none of which would have been out of place in Lewis Carroll\u2019s Jabberwocky.",
        "I think Douglas\u2019s was the most original mind I\u2019ve ever encountered.",
        "He had a unique ability to make connections between disparate ideas.",
        "In the world of Hitchhiker it appears quite logical that a drinks party should hurtle endlessly through space, or that a new mathematical system should be based on people\u2019s behaviour in restaurants.",
        "Life, the Universe and Everything is the book in which Douglas gets closest to actually having a plot.",
        "But as he would readily admit, he wasn\u2019t really good at plots, and it isn\u2019t a very good plot.",
        "That couldn\u2019t matter less, though.",
        "You don\u2019t read Douglas Adams for his plots any more than you read Raymond Chandler for his.",
        "You read both authors for their language and the imaginative world that they create.",
        "So enjoy this book.",
        "The writing process for Douglas was an agonizingly slow one, but the results were always worth waiting for.",
        "And Life, the Universe and Everything has another rare distinction.",
        "It is one of the very few books featuring cricket ever to have been a success in the States.",
        "SIMON BRETT Producer of the Radio 4 pilot episode of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy 1 The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was.",
        "It wasn\u2019t just that the cave was cold, it wasn\u2019t just that it was damp and smelly.",
        "It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of Islington and there wasn\u2019t a bus due for two million years.",
        "Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal.",
        "At least being lost in space kept you busy.",
        "He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he had ever dreamt existed, and though life had now turned very, very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy.",
        "He hadn\u2019t been blown up now for five years.",
        "Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had parted company four years previously, he hadn\u2019t been insulted in all that time either.",
        "Except just once.",
        "It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously.",
        "He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds.",
        "He turned and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his heart.",
        "Rescue.",
        "Escape.",
        "The cast away\u2019s impossible dream \u2013 a ship.",
        "And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology.",
        "It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm.",
        "A ramp extended itself.",
        "Light streamed out.",
        "A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway.",
        "It walked down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re a jerk, Dent,\u2019 it said simply.",
        "It was alien, very alien.",
        "It had a peculiar alien tallness, a peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes, extravagantly draped golden robes with a peculiarly alien collar design, and pale grey green alien skin which had about it that lustrous sheen which most grey green faces can only acquire with plenty of exercise and very expensive soap.",
        "Arthur boggled at it.",
        "It gazed levelly at him.",
        "Arthur\u2019s first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly been overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were battling for the use of his vocal cords at this moment.",
        "\u2018Whh \u2026 ?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Bu \u2026 hu \u2026 uh \u2026\u2019 he added.",
        "\u2018Ru \u2026 ra \u2026 wah \u2026 who?\u2019 he managed finally to say and lapsed into a frantic kind of silence.",
        "He was feeling the effects of having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could remember.",
        "The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and spindly alien hand.",
        "\u2018Arthur Dent?\u2019 it said.",
        "Arthur nodded helplessly.",
        "\u2018Arthur Philip Dent?\u2019 pursued the alien in a kind of efficient yap.",
        "\u2018Er \u2026 er \u2026 yes \u2026 er \u2026 er,\u2019 confirmed Arthur.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re a jerk,\u2019 repeated the alien, \u2018a complete asshole.\u2019 \u2018Er \u2026\u2019 The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its clipboard and turned briskly back towards its ship.",
        "\u2018Er \u2026\u2019 said Arthur desperately, \u2018er \u2026\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t give me that,\u2019 snapped the alien.",
        "It marched up the ramp, through the hatchway and disappeared into its ship.",
        "The ship sealed itself.",
        "It started to make a low throbbing hum.",
        "\u2018Er, hey!\u2019 shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards it.",
        "\u2018Wait a minute!\u2019 he called.",
        "\u2018What is this? What? Wait a minute!\u2019 The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the ground, and hovered briefly.",
        "It swept strangely up into the evening sky.",
        "It passed up through the clouds, illuminating them briefly, and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 he screamed.",
        "\u2018What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and say that!\u2019 He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till his lungs rasped.",
        "There was no answer from anyone.",
        "There was no one to hear him or speak to him.",
        "The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each other.",
        "Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned back in its single seat.",
        "His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged.",
        "He was a man with a purpose.",
        "Not a very good purpose, as he would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a purpose and it did at least keep him on the move.",
        "Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was \u2013 indeed, is \u2013 one of the Universe\u2019s very small number of immortal beings.",
        "Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with it, but Wowbagger was not one of them.",
        "Indeed he had come to hate them, the load of serene bastards.",
        "He had had his immortality inadvertently thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands.",
        "The precise details of the accident are not important because no one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very silly, or dead, or both, trying.",
        "Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put some light jazz on the ship\u2019s stereo, and reflected that he could have made it if it hadn\u2019t been for Sunday afternoons, he really could have done.",
        "To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously, taking risks, cleaning up on high yield long term investments, and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody.",
        "In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn\u2019t cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2.55, when you know that you\u2019ve had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o\u2019clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.",
        "So things began to pall for him.",
        "The merry smiles he used to wear at other people\u2019s funerals began to fade.",
        "He began to despise the Universe in general and everybody in it in particular.",
        "This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see, would drive him on for ever.",
        "It was this.",
        "He would insult the Universe.",
        "That is, he would insult everybody in it.",
        "Individually, personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order.",
        "When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he would merely fix them with a steely look and say, \u2018A man can dream, can\u2019t he?\u2019 And so he had started out.",
        "He equipped a spaceship that was built to last with a computer capable of handling all the data processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated routes involved.",
        "His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system, preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into interstellar space.",
        "\u2018Computer,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Here,\u2019 yipped the computer.",
        "\u2018Where next?\u2019 \u2018Computing that.\u2019 Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the infinite darkness with light.",
        "Every one, every single one, was on his itinerary.",
        "Most of them he would be going to millions of times over.",
        "He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots in the sky like a child\u2019s numbered dots puzzle.",
        "He hoped that from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell a very very rude word.",
        "The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished its calculations.",
        "\u2018Folfanga,\u2019 it said.",
        "It beeped.",
        "\u2018Fourth world of the Folfanga system,\u2019 it continued.",
        "It beeped again.",
        "\u2018Estimated journey time, three weeks,\u2019 it continued further.",
        "It beeped again.",
        "\u2018There to meet with a small slug,\u2019 it beeped, \u2018of the genus A Rth Urp Hil Ipdenu.\u2019 \u2018I believe,\u2019 it added, after a slight pause during which it beeped, \u2018that you had decided to call it a brainless prat.\u2019 Wowbagger grunted.",
        "He watched the majesty of creation outside his window for a moment or two.",
        "\u2018I think I\u2019ll take a nap,\u2019 he said, and then added, \u2018What network areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?\u2019 The computer beeped.",
        "\u2018Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box,\u2019 it said, and beeped.",
        "\u2018Any movies I haven\u2019t seen thirty thousand times already?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Uh.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s Angst in Space.",
        "You\u2019ve only seen that thirty three thousand five hundred and seventeen times.\u2019 \u2018Wake me for the second reel.\u2019 The computor beeped.",
        "\u2018Sleep well,\u2019 it said.",
        "The ship fled on through the night.",
        "Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of his entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening.",
        "The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because he thought it would be useful to keep things in.",
        "2 This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think of a better name for it or find a better cave.",
        "Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood.",
        "He wrapped his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at the bright morning.",
        "The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each other, the butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it possibly could.",
        "It wasn\u2019t all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel so cheery, though.",
        "He had just had a wonderful idea about how to cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric Earth, which was that he would go mad.",
        "He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over from his supper.",
        "He chewed happily for a few moments and then decided formally to announce his decision.",
        "He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields and hills.",
        "To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in his hair.",
        "He spread his arms out wide.",
        "\u2018I will go mad!\u2019 he announced.",
        "\u2018Good idea,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on which he had been sitting.",
        "Arthur\u2019s brain somersaulted.",
        "His jaw did press ups.",
        "\u2018I went mad for a while,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018did me no end of good.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s eyes did cartwheels.",
        "\u2018You see,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018 \u2013 \u2026\u2019 \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 interrupted Arthur, now that his head had finished working out.",
        "\u2018Around,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018around and about.\u2019 He grinned in what he accurately judged to be an infuriating manner.",
        "\u2018I just took my mind off the hook for a bit.",
        "I reckoned that if the world wanted me badly enough it would call back.",
        "It did.\u2019 He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel his Sub Etha Sens O Matic.",
        "\u2018At least,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think it did.",
        "This has been playing up a bit.\u2019 He shook it.",
        "\u2018If it was a false alarm I shall go mad,\u2019 he said, \u2018again.\u2019 Arthur shook his head and sat down.",
        "He looked up.",
        "\u2018I thought you must be dead \u2026\u2019 he said simply.",
        "\u2018So did I for a while,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018and then I decided I was a lemon for a couple of weeks.",
        "I kept myself amused all that time jumping in and out of a gin and tonic.\u2019 Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again.",
        "\u2018Where,\u2019 he said, \u2018did you \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018Find a gin and tonic?\u2019 said Ford brightly.",
        "\u2018I found a small lake that thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of that.",
        "At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic.",
        "\u2018I may,\u2019 he added with a grin which would have sent sane men scampering into trees, \u2018have been imagining it.\u2019 He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than that.",
        "\u2018Carry on,\u2019 he said evenly.",
        "\u2018The point is, you see,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad.",
        "You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later.\u2019 \u2018And this is you sane again, is it?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I ask merely for information.\u2019 \u2018I went to Africa,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018What was that like?\u2019 \u2018And this is your cave, is it?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Er, yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "He felt very strange.",
        "After nearly four years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see Ford that he could almost cry.",
        "Ford was, on the other hand, an almost immediately annoying person.",
        "\u2018Very nice,\u2019 said Ford, in reference to Arthur\u2019s cave.",
        "\u2018You must hate it.\u2019 Arthur didn\u2019t bother to reply.",

        "\u2018But only,\u2019 he added, \u2018as a hobby.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, warily.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 Ford assured him.",
        "\u2018I won\u2019t disturb you with the details because they would\u2014\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Disturb you.",
        "But you may be interested to know that I am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe.",
        "And I tried to learn to fly.",
        "Do you believe me?\u2019 \u2018Tell me,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll tell you later.",

        "The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\u2019 He smiled weakly.",
        "He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows.",

        "\u2018The difficulty with this conversation,\u2019 said Arthur after a sort of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, \u2018is that it\u2019s very different from most of the ones I\u2019ve had of late.",
        "Which, as I explained, have mostly been with trees.",

        "\u2018Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very very simple.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well I\u2019m not sure I believe that.\u2019 They sat down and composed their thoughts.",

        "\u2018There, behind that sofa!\u2019 Arthur looked.",
        "Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them.",
        "He boggled intelligently at it.",
        "Shrewd questions sprang into his mind.",
        "\u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018is there a sofa in that field?\u2019 \u2018I told you!\u2019 shouted Ford, leaping to his feet.",
        "\u2018Eddies in the space\u2013time continuum!\u2019 \u2018And this is his sofa, is it?\u2019 asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses.",

        "\u2018Catch it?\u2019 muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across the grass.",
        "With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the irrational piece of furniture.",
        "They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing, shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this way or that way.",
        "The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass, tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake.",
        "Arthur felt happy.",
        "He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan.",
        "Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth.",
        "The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others.",
        "Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography, which it was.",
        "Still they pursued, still it danced and spun, and suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it.",
        "With a heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the middle of the pitch at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, St John\u2019s Wood, London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the Australian Series in the year 198\u2014, with England needing only twenty eight runs to win.",

        "The applause of the crowd was tremendous.",
        "It wasn\u2019t for them, but instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding whistled mere millimetres over Arthur\u2019s head.",
        "In the crowd a man collapsed.",
        "They threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin hideously around them.",

        "\u2018I need shapes.\u2019 The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of astonishment, and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what they had just seen or not.",

        "\u2018What was that?\u2019 whispered Ford.",

        "Arthur looked again.",
        "\u2018It is shaped,\u2019 he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely furrowed, \u2018like a policeman.\u2019 They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning deeply.",

        "\u2018Come on, you two,\u2019 the shape said, \u2018let\u2019s be having you.\u2019 These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur.",
        "He leapt to his feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of startled glances at the panorama around him which had suddenly settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness.",
        "\u2018Where did you get this from?\u2019 he yelled at the policeman shape.",
        "\u2018What did you say?\u2019 said the startled shape.",
        "\u2018This is Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 snapped Arthur.",
        "\u2018Where did you find it, how did you get it here? I think,\u2019 he added, clasping his hand to his brow, \u2018that I had better calm down.\u2019 He squatted down abruptly in front of Ford.",
        "\u2018It is a policeman,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018What do we do?\u2019 Ford shrugged.",
        "\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I want you,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018to tell me that I have been dreaming for the last five years.\u2019 Ford shrugged again, and obliged.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ve been dreaming for the last five years,\u2019 he said.",
        "Arthur got to his feet.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s all right, officer,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve been dreaming for the last five years.",
        "Ask him,\u2019 he added, pointing at Ford, \u2018he was in it.\u2019 Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch, brushing down his dressing gown.",
        "He then noticed his dressing gown and stopped.",
        "He stared at it.",
        "He flung himself at the policeman.",
        "\u2018So where did I get these clothes from?\u2019 he howled.",
        "He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass.",
        "Ford shook his head.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s had a bad two million years,\u2019 he said to the policeman, and together they heaved Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off the pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden disappearance of the sofa on the way.",
        "Reactions to all this from the crowd were many and various.",
        "Most of them couldn\u2019t cope with watching it, and listened to it on the radio instead.",
        "\u2018Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian,\u2019 said one radio commentator to another.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t think there have been any mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well I don\u2019t think there have been any \u2013 have there? \u2013 that I recall?\u2019 \u2018Edgbaston, 1932?\u2019 \u2018Ah, now what happened then \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming up to bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight across the pitch.\u2019 There was a pause whilst the first commentator considered this.",
        "\u2018Ye \u2026 e \u2026 s \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018yes, there\u2019s nothing actually very mysterious about that, is there? He didn\u2019t actually materialize, did he? Just ran on.\u2019 \u2018No, that\u2019s true, but he did claim to have seen something materialize on the pitch.\u2019 \u2018Ah, did he?\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "An alligator, I think, of some description.\u2019 \u2018Ah.",
        "And had anyone else noticed it?\u2019 \u2018Apparently not.",
        "And no one was able to get a very detailed description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was made.\u2019 \u2018And what happened to the man?\u2019 \u2018Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some lunch but he explained that he\u2019d already had a rather good one, so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by three wickets.\u2019 \u2018So, not very like this current instance.",
        "For those of you who\u2019ve just tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er \u2026 two men, two rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa \u2013 a Chesterfield, I think?\u2019 \u2018Yes, a Chesterfield.\u2019 \u2018Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground.",
        "But I don\u2019t think they meant any harm, they\u2019ve been very good natured about it, and\u2014\u2019 \u2018Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment, Peter, and say that the sofa has just vanished.\u2019 \u2018So it has.",
        "Well, that\u2019s one mystery less.",
        "Still, it\u2019s definitely one for the record books, I think, particularly occurring at this dramatic moment in play, England now needing only twenty four runs to win the series.",
        "The men are leaving the pitch in the company of a police officer, and I think everyone\u2019s settling down now and play is about to resume.\u2019 \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 said the policeman after they had made a passage through the curious crowd and laid Arthur\u2019s peacefully inert body on a blanket, \u2018perhaps you\u2019d care to tell me who you are, where you come from, and what that little scene was all about?\u2019 Ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself for something, then he straightened up and aimed a look at the policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the six light years\u2019 distance between Earth and Ford\u2019s home near Betelgeuse.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, very quietly, \u2018I\u2019ll tell you.\u2019 \u2018Yes, well, that won\u2019t be necessary,\u2019 said the policeman hurriedly, \u2018just don\u2019t let whatever it was happen again.\u2019 The policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone who wasn\u2019t from Betelgeuse.",
        "Fortunately, the ground was full of them.",
        "Arthur\u2019s consciousness approached his body as from a great distance, and reluctantly.",
        "It had had some bad times in there.",
        "Slowly, nervously, it entered and settled down in to its accustomed position.",
        "Arthur sat up.",
        "\u2018Where am I?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for a quick breather.",
        "His body flopped back on the grass.",
        "Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face.",

        "His face froze for a second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing trick which Arctic ice floes do so spectacularly in the spring.",
        "\u2018And the other thing,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018is that you appear to have a bone in your beard.\u2019 He tossed back his tea.",
        "Outside the refreshment tent, the sun was shining on a happy crowd.",
        "It shone on white hats and red faces.",
        "It shone on ice lollies and melted them.",
        "It shone on the tears of small children whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick.",
        "It shone on the trees, it flashed off whirling cricket bats, it gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked behind the sight screens and which nobody appeared to have noticed.",
        "It beamed on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them.",
        "Arthur was shaking.",
        "\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 he said, \u2018I should \u2026\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford sharply.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t try and phone yourself up at home.\u2019 \u2018How did you know \u2026 ?\u2019 Ford shrugged.",
        "\u2018But why not?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018People who talk to themselves on the phone,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018never learn anything to their advantage.\u2019 \u2018But \u2026\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an imaginary dial.",
        "\u2018Hello?\u2019 he said into the imaginary mouthpiece.",
        "\u2018Is that Arthur Dent? Ah, hello, yes.",
        "This is Arthur Dent speaking.",
        "Don\u2019t hang up.\u2019 He looked at the imaginary phone in disappointment.",
        "\u2018He hung up,\u2019 he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone neatly back on its imaginary hook.",
        "\u2018This is not my first temporal anomaly,\u2019 he added.",
        "A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent\u2019s face.",
        "\u2018So we\u2019re not home and dry,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018We could not even be said,\u2019 replied Ford, \u2018to be home and vigorously towelling ourselves off.\u2019 The game continued.",
        "The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a trot, and then a run.",
        "He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms and legs, out of which flew a ball.",
        "The batsman swung and thwacked it behind him over the sight screens.",
        "Ford\u2019s eyes followed the trajectory of the ball and jagged momentarily.",
        "He stiffened.",
        "He looked along the flight path of the ball again and his eyes twitched again.",
        "\u2018This isn\u2019t my towel,\u2019 said Arthur, who was rummaging in his rabbit skin bag.",
        "\u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He screwed his eyes up in concentration.",
        "\u2018I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel,\u2019 continued Arthur, \u2018it was blue with yellow stars on it.",
        "This isn\u2019t it.\u2019 \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Ford again.",
        "He covered one eye and looked with the other.",
        "\u2018This one\u2019s pink,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it isn\u2019t yours, is it?\u2019 \u2018I would like you to shut up about your towel,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018It isn\u2019t my towel,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018that is the point I am trying to \u2026\u2019 \u2018And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it,\u2019 continued Ford in a low growl, \u2018is now.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the primitively stitched rabbit skin bag.",
        "\u2018I realize that it is probably not important in the cosmic scale of things, it\u2019s just odd, that\u2019s all.",
        "A pink towel suddenly, instead of a blue one with yellow stars.\u2019 Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way which was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved.",
        "What he was doing was this.",
        "Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and blinking a lot.",
        "After a moment or two of this he started to stalk forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of concentration, like a leopard that is not sure whether it\u2019s just seen a half empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot and dusty plain.",
        "\u2018This isn\u2019t my bag either,\u2019 said Arthur suddenly.",
        "Ford\u2019s spell of concentration was broken.",
        "He turned angrily on Arthur.",
        "\u2018I wasn\u2019t talking about my towel,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve established that that isn\u2019t mine.",
        "It\u2019s just that the bag into which I was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine, though it is extraordinarily similar.",
        "Now personally I think that that is extremely odd, especially as the bag was one I made myself on prehistoric Earth.",
        "These are also not my stones,\u2019 he added, pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag.",
        "\u2018I was making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly very dull ones.\u2019 A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of information.",
        "The cricket ball which had excited this reaction fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur\u2019s mysterious rabbit skin bag.",
        "\u2018Now I would say that that was also a very curious event,\u2019 said Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the ball on the ground.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s here,\u2019 he said to the small boys who immediately clustered round him to join in the search, \u2018it probably rolled off somewhere.",
        "Over there I expect.\u2019 He pointed vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off.",
        "One of the boys looked at him quizzically.",
        "\u2018You all right?\u2019 said the boy.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Then why you got a bone in your beard?\u2019 said the boy.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m training it to like being wherever it\u2019s put.\u2019 Arthur prided himself on saying this.",
        "It was, he thought, exactly the sort of thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds.",
        "\u2018Oh,\u2019 said the small boy, putting his head on one side and thinking about it.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s your name?\u2019 \u2018Dent,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018Arthur Dent.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re a jerk, Dent,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018a complete asshole.\u2019 The boy looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn\u2019t in any particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off scratching his nose.",
        "Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth was going to be demolished again in two days\u2019 time, and just this once didn\u2019t feel too bad about it.",
        "Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking.",
        "\u2018Something\u2019s on your mind, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now recognized as one which presage something utterly unintelligible, \u2018that there\u2019s an SEP over there.\u2019 He pointed.",
        "Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not the one in which he was looking.",
        "Arthur looked in the one direction, which was towards the sight screens, and in the other which was at the field of play.",
        "He nodded, he shrugged.",
        "He shrugged again.",
        "\u2018A what?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018An SEP.\u2019 \u2018An S \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018\u2026 EP.\u2019 \u2018And what\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Somebody Else\u2019s Problem,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Ah, good,\u2019 said Arthur and relaxed.",
        "He had no idea what all that was about, but at best it seemed to be over.",
        "It wasn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018Over there,\u2019 said Ford, again pointing at the sight screens and looking at the pitch.",
        "\u2018Where?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018There!\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur, who didn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018You do?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Can you see,\u2019 said Ford patiently, \u2018the SEP?\u2019 \u2018I thought you said that was someone else\u2019s problem.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense cupidity.",
        "\u2018And I want to know,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018if you can see it.\u2019 \u2018You do?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018does it look like?\u2019 \u2018Well, how should I know, you fool?\u2019 shouted Ford.",
        "\u2018If you can see it, you tell me.\u2019 Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with Ford.",
        "His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel.",
        "Ford took him by the arm.",
        "\u2018An SEP,\u2019 he said, \u2018is something that we can\u2019t see, or don\u2019t see, or our brain doesn\u2019t let us see, because we think that it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.",
        "That\u2019s what SEP means.",
        "Somebody Else\u2019s Problem.",
        "The brain just edits it out, it\u2019s like a blind spot.",
        "If you look at it directly you won\u2019t see it unless you know precisely what it is.",
        "Your only hope is to catch it by surprise out of the corner of your eye.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018then that\u2019s why \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say.",
        "\u2018\u2026 you\u2019ve been jumping up and \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 down, and blinking \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 and \u2026\u2019 \u2018I think you\u2019ve got the message.\u2019 \u2018I can see it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s a spaceship.\u2019 For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation provoked.",
        "A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other in a tumult of confusion.",
        "He stumbled back in astonishment and glanced fearfully around.",
        "Then he glanced around again in even greater astonishment.",
        "\u2018Exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said an apparition.",
        "The apparition wobbled in front of Arthur\u2019s eyes, though the truth of the matter is probably that Arthur\u2019s eyes were wobbling in front of the apparition.",
        "His mouth wobbled as well.",
        "\u2018W \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026\u2019 his mouth said.",
        "\u2018I think your team have just won,\u2019 said the apparition.",
        "\u2018W \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026\u2019 repeated Arthur, and punctuated each wobble with a prod at Ford Prefect\u2019s back.",
        "Ford was staring at the tumult in trepidation.",
        "\u2018You are English, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 said the apparition.",
        "\u2018W \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 w \u2026 yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well, your team, as I say, have just won.",
        "The match.",
        "It means they retain the Ashes.",
        "You must be very pleased.",
        "I must say, I\u2019m rather fond of cricket, though I wouldn\u2019t like anyone outside this planet to hear me saying that.",
        "Oh dear no.\u2019 The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was directly behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head and illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way which was awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins.",
        "\u2018Still,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019ll all be over in a couple of days, won\u2019t it? Though as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry about that.",
        "Still, whatever will have been, will have been.\u2019 Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle.",
        "He prodded Ford again.",
        "\u2018I thought something terrible had happened,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but it\u2019s just the end of the game.",
        "We ought to get out.",
        "Oh, hello, Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?\u2019 \u2018Oh, pottering, pottering,\u2019 said the old man gravely.",
        "\u2018That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?\u2019 \u2018Patience, patience,\u2019 the old man admonished.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s just that this planet\u2019s going to be demolished pretty soon.\u2019 \u2018I know that,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018And, well, I just wanted to make that point,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018The point is taken.\u2019 \u2018And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket pitch at this point \u2026\u2019 \u2018I do.\u2019 \u2018Then it\u2019s your ship.\u2019 \u2018It is.\u2019 \u2018I suppose.\u2019 Ford turned away sharply at this point.",
        "\u2018Hello, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Arthur at last.",
        "\u2018Hello, Earthman,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018After all,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we can only die once.\u2019 The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch with eyes which seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent bearing on what was happening out there.",
        "What was happening was that the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the centre of the pitch.",
        "What Slartibartfast saw in it, he alone knew.",
        "Ford was humming something.",
        "It was just one note repeated at intervals.",
        "He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was humming, but nobody did.",
        "If anybody had asked him he would have said he was humming the first line of a No\u00ebl Coward song called \u2018Mad About the Boy\u2019 over and over again.",
        "It would then have been pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be apparent, he was omitting the \u2018about the boy\u2019 bit.",
        "He was annoyed that nobody asked.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 he burst out at last, \u2018that if we don\u2019t go soon, we might get caught in the middle of it all again.",
        "And there\u2019s nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being destroyed.",
        "Except possibly still being on it when it happens.",
        "Or,\u2019 he added in an undertone, \u2018hanging around cricket matches.\u2019 \u2018Patience,\u2019 said Slartibartfast again.",
        "\u2018Great things are afoot.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s what you said last time we met,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018They were,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018Yes, that\u2019s true,\u2019 admitted Arthur.",
        "All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some kind.",
        "It was being specially staged for the benefit of TV rather than the spectators, and all they could gather about it from where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio.",
        "Ford was aggressively uninterested.",
        "He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to be presented to the captain of the English team out there on the pitch, fumed when told that this was because they had now won them for the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the information that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket stump, and when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne, Australia, in 1882, to signify the \u2018death of English cricket\u2019, he rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep breath, but didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything because the old man wasn\u2019t there.",
        "He was marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait, his hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as Moses would have looked if Sinai had been a well cut lawn instead of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery smoking mountain.",
        "\u2018He said to meet him at his ship,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018What in the name of Zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?\u2019 exploded Ford.",
        "\u2018Meeting us at his ship in two minutes,\u2019 said Arthur with a shrug which indicated total abdication of thought.",
        "They started off towards it.",
        "Strange sounds reached their ears.",
        "They tried not to listen, but could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing the Ashes, as they were, he said, \u2018vitally important for the past, present and safety of the Galaxy\u2019, and that this was causing wild hilarity.",
        "They resolved to ignore it.",
        "What happened next they could not ignore.",
        "With a noise like a hundred thousand people saying \u2018wop\u2019, a steely white spaceship suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite menace and a slight hum.",
        "Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to go about their normal business and not mind it just hanging there.",
        "Then it did something quite extraordinary.",
        "Or rather, it opened up and let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven quite extraordinary things.",
        "They were robots, white robots.",
        "What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to have come dressed for the occasion.",
        "Not only were they white, but they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that, but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts of their legs.",
        "These last were extraordinary because they appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to kill people, which is what they did.",
        "\u2018Hello,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018something seems to be happening.\u2019 \u2018Get to the ship,\u2019 shouted Ford.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t want to know, just get to the ship.\u2019 He started to run.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t want to know, I don\u2019t want to see, I don\u2019t want to hear,\u2019 he yelled as he ran, \u2018this is not my planet, I didn\u2019t choose to be here, I don\u2019t want to get involved, just get me out of here, and get me to a party, with people I can relate to!\u2019 Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch.",
        "\u2018Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in force here today \u2026\u2019 burbled a radio happily to itself.",
        "\u2018What I need,\u2019 shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous remarks, \u2018is a strong drink and a peer group.\u2019 He continued to run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur\u2019s arm and drag him along with him.",
        "Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over him.",
        "\u2018They\u2019re playing cricket,\u2019 muttered Arthur, stumbling along after Ford.",
        "\u2018I swear they are playing cricket.",
        "I do not know why they are doing this, but that is what they are doing.",
        "They\u2019re not just killing people, they\u2019re sending them up,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018Ford, they\u2019re sending us up!\u2019 It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a great deal more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed to pick up in his travels.",
        "The ghostly but violent shapes that could be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the difference being that every ball they struck with their bats exploded wherever it landed.",
        "The very first one of these had dispelled Arthur\u2019s initial reaction, that the whole thing might just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers.",
        "And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over.",
        "The eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a hundred thousand people saying \u2018foop\u2019, promptly vanished into the thin air out of which it had wopped.",
        "For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast looking even more like Moses because in spite of the continued absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across a fiery and smoking well mown lawn.",
        "He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the opposite direction.",
        "The crowd was clearly thinking to itself about what an unusual day this was turning out to be, and not really knowing which way, if any, to turn.",
        "Slartibartfast was gesticulating urgently at Ford and Arthur and shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his ship, still parked behind the sight screens and still apparently unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had enough of their own problems to cope with at that time.",
        "\u2018They\u2019ve garble warble farble!\u2019 shouted Slartibartfast in his thin tremulous voice.",
        "\u2018What did he say?\u2019 panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards.",
        "Arthur shook his head.",
        "\u2018\u201cThey\u2019ve \u2026\u201d something or other,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018They\u2019ve garble warble farble!\u2019 shouted Slartibartfast again.",
        "Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other.",
        "\u2018It sounds urgent,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "He stopped and shouted.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019ve garble warble fashes!\u2019 cried Slartibartfast, still waving at them.",
        "\u2018He says,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that they\u2019ve taken the Ashes.",
        "That is what I think he says.\u2019 They ran on.",
        "\u2018The \u2026 ?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Ashes,\u2019 said Arthur tersely.",
        "\u2018The burnt remains of a cricket stump.",
        "It\u2019s a trophy.",
        "That \u2026\u2019 he was panting, \u2018is \u2026 apparently \u2026 what they \u2026 have come and taken.\u2019 He shook his head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle down lower in his skull.",
        "\u2018Strange thing to want to tell us,\u2019 snapped Ford.",
        "\u2018Strange thing to take.\u2019 \u2018Strange ship.\u2019 They had arrived at it.",
        "The second strangest thing about the ship was watching the Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field at work.",
        "They could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because they knew it was there.",
        "It was quite apparent, however, that nobody else could.",
        "This wasn\u2019t because it was actually invisible or anything hyper impossible like that.",
        "The technology involved in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine hundred and ninety nine thousand million, nine hundred and ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine times out of a billion it is much simpler and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it.",
        "The ultra famous sciento magician Effrafax of Wug once bet his life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain Magramal entirely invisible.",
        "Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux O Valves and Refracto Nullifiers and Spectrum Bypass O Matics, he realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn\u2019t going to make it.",
        "So, he and his friends, and his friends\u2019 friends, and his friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends, and his friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends\u2019 friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what is now widely recognized as being the hardest night\u2019s work in history, and, sure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer visible.",
        "Effrafax lost his bet \u2013 and therefore his life \u2013 simply because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when walking around the area that Magramal ought to be in he didn\u2019t trip over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious looking extra moon.",
        "The Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field is much simpler and effective, and what is more can be run for over a hundred years on a single torch battery.",
        "This is because it relies on people\u2019s natural predisposition not to see anything they don\u2019t want to, weren\u2019t expecting, or can\u2019t explain.",
        "If Effrafax had painted the mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field on it, then people would have walked past the mountain, round it, even over it, and simply never have noticed that the thing was there.",
        "And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast\u2019s ship.",
        "It wasn\u2019t pink, but if it had been, that would have been the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring it like anything.",
        "The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only partly like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended Italian bistro.",
        "Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply offended sensibilities.",
        "\u2018Yes, I know,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that point, breathless and agitated, \u2018but there is a reason.",
        "Come, we must go.",

        "Doom confronts us all.",
        "We must leave at once.\u2019 \u2018I fancy somewhere sunny,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally unaware of what happened next outside.",
        "A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver, descended from the sky on to the pitch, without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology.",
        "It landed gently.",
        "It extended a short ramp.",
        "A tall grey green figure marched briskly out and approached the small knot of people who were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre.",
        "It moved people aside with quiet, understated authority, and came at last to a man lying in a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the reach of any Earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last.",
        "The figure knelt down quietly beside him.",
        "\u2018Arthur Philip Deodat?\u2019 asked the figure.",

        "6 It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside and let them through.",
        "It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the cosmos were streaming through each other.",
        "It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe, and that the wind was him.",
        "It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe and that the Universe was a thought of his.",
        "It seemed to the people at Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground that another North London restaurant had just come and gone as they so often do, and that this was Somebody Else\u2019s Problem.",

        "He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert Fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning down.",
        "Then his brow cleared and he stared for a moment at the wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads around them.",
        "His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something.",
        "Suddenly his eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his expression merely subsided into a steady frown.",
        "He looked back up at the screen.",
        "He felt his own pulse.",
        "His frown deepened for a moment, then he relaxed.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a mistake to try and understand machines,\u2019 he said, \u2018they only worry me.",
        "What did you say?\u2019 \u2018D\u00e9cor,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Pity about it.\u2019 \u2018Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018there is a reason.\u2019 Ford glanced sharply around.",
        "He clearly thought this was taking an optimistic view of things.",
        "The interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark brown, cramped and moodily lit.",
        "Inexplicably, the resemblance to a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway.",

        "Raffia wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows.",
        "The instruments which had occupied Slartibartfast\u2019s attention seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in concrete.",

        "Plastic.",
        "Fake bottles set in fake concrete.",
        "The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish.",
        "On the other hand, it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the Heart of Gold seem like an electric pram.",
        "He swung himself off the couch.",
        "He brushed himself down.",
        "He looked at Arthur, who was singing quietly to himself.",
        "He looked at the screen and recognized nothing.",
        "He looked at Slartibartfast.",

        "Here,\u2019 he said, stabbing his finger at the screen of the Guide, \u2018would be a really wicked place to go, and I think we should.",
        "What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras and pay attention.",
        "There\u2019s important stuff you\u2019re missing here.\u2019 Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head.",

        "Arthur, with a frown, followed.",
        "Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel.",
        "\u2018My doctor says that I have a malformed public duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre,\u2019 he muttered to himself, \u2018and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes.\u2019 Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them.",
        "What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and Ford shook his head, buried his face in his hands and slumped against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall.",
        "\u2018The central computational area,\u2019 said Slartibartfast unperturbed, \u2018this is where every calculation affecting the ship in any way is performed.",
        "Yes I know what it looks like, but it is in fact a complex four dimensional topographical map of a series of highly complex mathematical functions.\u2019 \u2018It looks like a joke,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I know what it looks like,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, and went into it.",
        "As he did so, Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it might mean, but he refused to believe it.",
        "The Universe could not possibly work like that, he thought, cannot possibly.",
        "That, he thought to himself, would be as absurd as, as absurd as \u2026 He terminated that line of thinking.",
        "Most of the really absurd things he could think of had already happened.",
        "And this was one of them.",
        "It was a large glass cage, or box \u2013 in fact a room.",
        "In it was a table, a long one.",
        "Around it were gathered about a dozen chairs, of the bentwood style.",
        "On it was a tablecloth \u2013 a grubby, red and white check tablecloth, scarred with the occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a precisely calculated mathematical position.",
        "And on the tablecloth sat some dozen half eaten Italian meals, hedged about with half eaten breadsticks and half drunk glasses of wine, and toyed with listlessly by robots.",
        "It was all completely artificial.",
        "The robot customers were attended by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot ma\u00eetre d\u2019.",
        "The furniture was artificial, the tablecloth artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo sorpreso, without actually being one.",
        "And all participated in a little dance together \u2013 a complex routine involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets, cheque books, credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins, which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence, but never actually getting anywhere.",
        "Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of day quite idly with the ma\u00eetre d\u2019, whilst one of the customer robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what he intended to do to some guy over some girl.",
        "Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and passed a shrewd eye over the menu.",
        "The tempo of the routine round the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken.",
        "Arguments broke out, people attempted to prove things on napkins.",
        "They waved fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each other\u2019s pieces of chicken.",
        "The waiter\u2019s hand began to move on the bill pad more quickly than a human hand could manage, and then more quickly than a human eye could follow.",
        "The pace accelerated.",
        "Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was suddenly achieved.",
        "A new vibration thrilled through the ship.",
        "Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room.",
        "\u2018Bistromathics,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018The most powerful computational force known to parascience.",
        "Come to the Room of Informational Illusions.\u2019 He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake.",
        "7 The Bistromathic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about with Improbability Factors.",
        "Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of understanding the behaviour of numbers.",
        "Just as Einstein observed that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer\u2019s movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but depended on the observer\u2019s movement in time, so it is now realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the observer\u2019s movement in restaurants.",
        "The first non absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved.",
        "This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up, or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the show/match/party/gig, or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up.",
        "The second non absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself.",
        "In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive.",
        "Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody Else\u2019s Problem field.",
        "The third and most mysterious piece of non absoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill, the cost of each item, the number of people at the table, and what they are each prepared to pay for.",
        "(The number of people who have actually brought any money is only a sub phenomenon in this field.) The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took them seriously.",
        "They were at the time put down to such things as politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness, emotionality, or the lateness of the hour, and completely forgotten about on the following morning.",
        "They were never tested under laboratory conditions, of course, because they never occurred in laboratories \u2013 not in reputable laboratories at least.",
        "And so it was, only with the advent of pocket computers that the startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this: Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the Universe.",
        "This single fact took the scientific world by storm.",
        "It completely revolutionized it.",
        "So many mathematical conferences got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science of maths was put back by years.",
        "Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be understood.",
        "To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too much what the man in the street would have said, \u2018Oh yes, I could have told you that,\u2019 about.",
        "Then some phrases like \u2018Interactive Subjectivity Frameworks\u2019 were invented, and everybody was able to relax and get on with it.",
        "The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect that the Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were eventually given a street theatre grant and went away.",
        "8 \u2018In space travel, you see,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, as he fiddled with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, \u2018in space travel \u2026\u2019 He stopped and looked about him.",
        "The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after the visual monstrosities of the central computational area.",
        "There was nothing in it.",
        "No information, no illusions, just themselves, white walls and a few small instruments which looked as if they were meant to plug into something which Slartibartfast couldn\u2019t find.",
        "\u2018Yes?\u2019 urged Arthur.",
        "He had picked up Slartibartfast\u2019s sense of urgency but didn\u2019t know what to do with it.",
        "\u2018Yes what?\u2019 said the old man.",
        "\u2018You were saying?\u2019 Slartibartfast looked at him sharply.",

        "Arthur nodded wisely to himself.",
        "After a while he realized that this wasn\u2019t getting him anywhere and decided that he would say \u2018What?\u2019 after all.",
        "\u2018In space travel,\u2019 repeated Slartibartfast, \u2018all the numbers are awful.\u2019 Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it.",
        "\u2018I was only,\u2019 said Slartibartfast with a sigh, \u2018trying to save you the trouble of asking me why all the ship\u2019s computations were being done on a waiter\u2019s bill pad.\u2019 Arthur frowned.",
        "\u2018Why,\u2019 he said, \u2018were all the ship\u2019s computations being done on a wait\u2014\u2019 He stopped.",
        "Slartibartfast said, \u2018Because in space travel all the numbers are awful.\u2019 He could tell that he wasn\u2019t getting his point across.",
        "\u2018Listen,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018On a waiter\u2019s bill pad numbers dance.",
        "You must have encountered the phenomenon.\u2019 \u2018Well \u2026\u2019 \u2018On a waiter\u2019s bill pad,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018reality and unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters.\u2019 \u2018What parameters?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s impossible to say,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s one of them.",
        "Strange but true.",
        "At least, I think it\u2019s strange,\u2019 he added, \u2018and I am assured that it\u2019s true.\u2019 At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into it.",
        "\u2018Do not be alarmed,\u2019 he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed look at it himself, and lunged back, \u2018it\u2019s \u2026\u2019 They didn\u2019t hear what he said, because at that moment the ship winked out of existence around them and a star battleship the size of a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze.",
        "A nightmare storm of blistering light seared through the blackness and smacked a fair bit off the planet directly behind them.",
        "They gaped, pop eyed, and were unable to scream.",
        "9 Another world, another day, another dawn.",
        "The early morning\u2019s thinnest sliver of light appeared silently.",
        "Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp.",
        "There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic.",
        "Creation holds its breath.",
        "The moment passed, as it regularly did on Sqornshellous Zeta, without incident.",
        "The mist clung to the surface of the marshes.",
        "The swamp trees were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct.",
        "It hung motionless like held breath.",
        "Nothing moved.",
        "There was silence.",

        "The entire thousand mile long bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking everybody with it.\u2019 There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the conversation during which a hundred thousand people seemed unexpectedly to say \u2018wop\u2019 and a team of white robots descended from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight military formation.",
        "For a sudden violent moment they were all there, in the swamp, wrenching Marvin\u2019s false leg off, and then they were gone again in their ship, which said \u2018foop\u2019.",
        "\u2018You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?\u2019 said Marvin to the gobbering mattress.",
        "Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was alone in the swamp.",
        "He flolloped around in astonishment and alarm.",
        "He almost lurgled in fear.",
        "He reared himself to see over the reeds, but there was nothing to see, no robot, no glittering bride, no ship, just more reeds.",
        "He listened, but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now familiar sound of half crazed etymologists calling distantly to each other across the sullen mire.",
        "10 The body of Arthur Dent spun.",
        "The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around it, and each particular shard spun silently through the void, reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of fire and destruction.",
        "And then the blackness behind the Universe exploded, and each particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell.",
        "And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the Universe erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind the shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an immense man speaking immense words.",
        "\u2018These, then,\u2019 said the figure, speaking from an immensely comfortable chair, \u2018were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest devastation ever visited upon our Galaxy.",
        "What you have experienced \u2026\u2019 Slartibartfast floated past, waving.",

        "Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 is what billions upon billions of innocent \u2026\u2019 \u2018Do not,\u2019 called out Slartibartfast floating past again, and fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall of the Room of Informational Illusions and which was in fact still stuck there, \u2018agree to buy anything at this point.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 people, creatures, your fellow beings \u2026\u2019 Music swelled \u2013 again, it was immense music, immense chords.",

        "Think of that, my friends.",

        "\u2018A happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the Wikkit Gate!\u2019 The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar to Arthur\u2019s addled brain.",

        "\u2018The Steel Pillar which represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!\u2019 Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the pillar on the left, which was, clearly, made of steel or something very like it.",

        "\u2018The Perspex Pillar,\u2019 announced the man, \u2018representing the forces of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!\u2019 Other searchlights played exotically up and down the right hand, transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a sudden inexplicable craving for ice cream in the stomach of Arthur Dent.",
        "\u2018And,\u2019 the thunderous voice continued, \u2018the Wooden Pillar, representing \u2026\u2019 and here his voice became just very slightly hoarse with wonderful sentiments, \u2018the forces of Nature and Spirituality.\u2019 The lights picked out the central pillar.",
        "The music moved bravely up into the realms of complete unspeakability.",
        "\u2018Between them supporting,\u2019 the voice rolled on, approaching its climax, \u2018the Golden Bail of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of Peace!\u2019 The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the discernible.",
        "At the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly gleaming bails sat and dazzled.",
        "There seemed to be girls sitting on top of them, or maybe they were meant to be angels.",
        "Angels are usually represented as wearing more than that, though.",
        "Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably meant to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights.",
        "\u2018There is not a world,\u2019 thrilled the man\u2019s expert voice, \u2018not a civilized world in the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered even today.",
        "Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial memories.",
        "This it was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and this it is that now locks their world away till the end of eternity!\u2019 And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the Wikkit Gate.",
        "Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have been about three feet high.",
        "\u2018Not the original key, of course.",
        "That, as everyone knows, was destroyed, blasted into the ever whirling eddies of the space\u2013time continuum and lost for ever.",
        "This is a remarkable replica, hand tooled by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own, in memory of those who fell, and in tribute to the Galaxy \u2013 our Galaxy \u2013 which they died to defend \u2026\u2019 Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment.",
        "\u2018Found it,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018We can lose all this rubbish.",
        "Just don\u2019t nod, that\u2019s all.\u2019 \u2018Now, let us bow our heads in payment,\u2019 intoned the voice, and then said it again, much faster and backwards.",
        "Lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabbled himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled itself around them.",
        "\u2018You get the gist?\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m astonished,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018and bewildered.\u2019 \u2018I was asleep,\u2019 said Ford, who floated into view at this point.",
        "\u2018Did I miss anything?\u2019 They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the edge of an agonizingly high cliff.",
        "The wind whipped out from their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the greatest and most powerful space battle fleets ever assembled in the Galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence.",
        "The sky was a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to blue and upwards to black.",
        "Smoke billowed down out of it at an incredible lick.",
        "Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge star battleship rushed away from them as if they\u2019d said \u2018boo\u2019, they only just recognized it as the point at which they had come in.",
        "But now things were too rapid, a video tactile blur which brushed and jiggled them through centuries of Galactic history, turning, twisting, flickering.",
        "The sound was a mere thin thrill.",
        "Periodically throughout the thickening jumble of events they sensed appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and these were always associated with certain recurring images, the only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalanche of tumbling history: a wicket gate, a small hard red ball, hard white robots, and also something less distinct, something dark and cloudy.",
        "But there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of the trilling passage of time.",
        "Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the definition of each individual click and gradually take on the quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion \u2013 and yet not an emotion.",
        "If it was an emotion, it was a totally emotionless one.",
        "It was hatred, implacable hatred.",
        "It was cold, not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold.",
        "It was impersonal, not like a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer issued parking summons is impersonal.",
        "And it was deadly \u2013 again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly.",
        "And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to be a scream of guilt and failure.",
        "And suddenly it stopped.",
        "They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening.",
        "The sun was setting.",
        "All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off gently into the distance.",
        "Birds sang about what they thought of it all, and the general opinion seemed to be good.",
        "A little way away could be heard the sound of children playing, and a little further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town.",
        "The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made of white stone.",
        "The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves.",
        "The sun had nearly set.",
        "As if out of nowhere, music began.",
        "Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped.",
        "A voice said, \u2018This \u2026\u2019 Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it stopped.",

        "Arthur felt happy.",
        "Even Ford seemed cheerful.",
        "They walked a short way in the direction of the town, and the Informational Illusion of the grass was pleasant and springy under their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the flowers smelt sweet and fragrant.",
        "Only Slartibartfast seemed apprehensive and out of sorts.",
        "He stopped and looked up.",
        "It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did at the end, so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they had just blurrily experienced, something nasty must be about to happen.",
        "He was distressed to think that something nasty could happen to somewhere as idyllic as this.",

        "He was fairly certain that no door had said \u2018wop\u2019 to him now.",
        "It was not the sort of thing doors said.",
        "Too concise.",
        "Furthermore, there were not enough doors.",
        "It sounded as if a hundred thousand people had said \u2018wop\u2019, which puzzled him because he was the only person on the ship.",
        "It was dark.",
        "Most of the ship\u2019s non essential systems were closed down.",
        "It was drifting idly in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the inky blackness of space.",
        "So which particular hundred thousand people would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected \u2018wop\u2019? He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor.",
        "It was all in deep shadow.",
        "There were just the very dim pinkish outlines to the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed whenever they spoke, though he had tried every way he could think of of stopping them.",
        "The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each other, because neither of them was currently a particularly engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error of looking into his soul.",
        "It had indeed been an error.",
        "It had been late one night \u2013 of course.",
        "It had been a difficult day \u2013 of course.",
        "There had been soulful music playing on the ship\u2019s sound system \u2013 of course.",
        "And he had, of course, been slightly drunk.",
        "In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of soul searching had applied, but it had, nevertheless, clearly been an error.",
        "Standing now, silent and alone, in the dark corridor he remembered the moment and shivered.",
        "His one head looked one way and his other the other and each decided that the other was the way to go.",
        "He listened but could hear nothing.",
        "All there had been was the \u2018wop\u2019.",
        "It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of people just to say one word.",
        "He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the bridge.",
        "There at least he would feel in control.",
        "He stopped again.",
        "The way he was feeling he didn\u2019t think he was an awfully good person to be in control.",
        "The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been discovering that he actually had a soul.",
        "In fact he\u2019d always more or less assumed that he had one as he had a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of somethings, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking there deep within him had given him a severe jolt.",
        "And then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasn\u2019t the totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position had a natural right to expect had jolted him again.",
        "Then he had thought about what his position actually was and the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink.",
        "He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it.",
        "He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right.",
        "\u2018Freedom,\u2019 he said aloud.",
        "Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom.",
        "\u2018I can\u2019t cope with it,\u2019 he said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn\u2019t yet reported on the condition of the first.",
        "He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right.",
        "He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together.",
        "Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well.",
        "He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth for moral support.",
        "\u2018You\u2019re drinking too much,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "His heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could now see into a whole person.",
        "He gave up and looked at the navigation screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal number of stars.",
        "\u2018Excitement and adventure and really wild things,\u2019 he muttered.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down near him, \u2018it\u2019s quite understandable that you\u2019re going to feel a little aimless for a bit.\u2019 He boggled at her.",
        "He had never seen anyone sit on their own lap before.",
        "\u2018Wow,\u2019 he said.",
        "He had another drink.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ve finished the mission you\u2019ve been on for years.\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t been on it.",
        "I\u2019ve tried to avoid being on it.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve still finished it.\u2019 He grunted.",
        "There seemed to be a terrific party going on in his stomach.",
        "\u2018I think it finished me,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox, I can go anywhere, do anything.",
        "I have the greatest ship in the known sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty well \u2026\u2019 \u2018Are they?\u2019 \u2018As far as I can tell.",
        "I\u2019m not an expert in personal relationships \u2026\u2019 Trillian raised her eyebrows.",
        "\u2018I am,\u2019 he added, \u2018one hell of a guy.",
        "I can do anything I want only I just don\u2019t have the faintest idea what.\u2019 He paused.",
        "\u2018One thing,\u2019 he further added, \u2018has suddenly ceased to lead to another\u2019 \u2013 in contradiction of which he had another drink and slid gracelessly off his chair.",
        "Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the ship\u2019s copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "It had some advice to offer on drunkenness.",
        "\u2018Go to it,\u2019 it said, \u2018and good luck.\u2019 It was cross referenced to the entry concerning the size of the Universe and ways of coping with that.",
        "Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday planet, and one of the wonders of the Galaxy.",
        "Han Wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra luxury hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the natural erosion of wind and rain.",
        "The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity against.",
        "Little is known of how this came about because none of the geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay there.",
        "Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the great white running shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy spaceport.",
        "The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the ground, and Trillian was enjoying herself.",
        "She heard Zaphod moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship.",
        "\u2018How are you?\u2019 she said over the general intercom.",
        "\u2018Fine,\u2019 he said brightly, \u2018terribly well.\u2019 \u2018Where are you?\u2019 \u2018In the bathroom.\u2019 \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Staying here.\u2019 After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway.",
        "\u2018Heigh ho,\u2019 said Eddie the computer.",
        "Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times and pushed the intercom switch.",
        "\u2018I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this point.\u2019 \u2018Probably not,\u2019 replied Zaphod from wherever he was.",
        "\u2018I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of yourself.\u2019 \u2018Whatever you think, I think,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018RECREATIONAL IMPOSSIBILITIES\u2019 was a heading which caught Trillian\u2019s eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip through the Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic drinks dispenser and read about how to fly.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying.",
        "There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying.",
        "The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.",
        "Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it.",
        "The first part is easy.",
        "All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it\u2019s going to hurt.",
        "That is, it\u2019s going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.",
        "Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.",
        "Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.",
        "One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally.",
        "It\u2019s no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because you won\u2019t.",
        "You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by something else when you\u2019re halfway there, so that you are no longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how much it\u2019s going to hurt if you fail to miss it.",
        "It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from these three things during the split second you have at your disposal.",
        "Hence most people\u2019s failure, and their eventual disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.",
        "If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phylum and/or personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.",
        "This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.",
        "Bob and float, float and bob.",
        "Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let yourself waft higher.",
        "Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.",
        "They are most likely to say something along the lines of, \u2018Good God, you can\u2019t possibly be flying!\u2019 It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly be right.",
        "Waft higher and higher.",
        "Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the treetops breathing regularly.",
        "DO NOT WAVE AT ANYBODY.",
        "When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.",
        "You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but just \u2013 allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway.",
        "You will also learn about how to land properly, which is something you will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first attempt.",
        "There are private flying clubs you can join which help you achieve the all important moment of distraction.",
        "They hire people with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes and exhibit and/or explain them at the critical moments.",
        "Few genuine hitchhikers will be able to afford to join these clubs, but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.",
        "Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod wasn\u2019t really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly, or for walking through mountains or for trying to get the Brantisvogan Civil Service to acknowledge a change of address card, which were the other things listed under the heading \u2018Recreational Impossibilities\u2019.",
        "Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius Syneca, a world of ice, snow, mind hurtling beauty and stunning cold.",
        "The trek from the snow plains of Liska to the summit of the Ice Crystal Pyramids of Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis and a team of Syneca Snowhounds, but the view from the top, a view which takes in the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism Mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights, is one which first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty, and Trillian, for one, felt that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty.",
        "They went into a low orbit.",
        "There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius Syneca beneath them.",
        "Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the other doing crosswords till late into the night.",
        "Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to get Zaphod talking.",
        "She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen synthomatics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could contrive \u2013 delicately oiled meats, scented fruits, fragrant cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines.",
        "She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking things through.",
        "\u2018Zark off,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life.",
        "She didn\u2019t even programme any coordinates, she hadn\u2019t the faintest idea where she was going, she just went \u2013 a random row of dots flowing through the Universe.",
        "\u2018Anything,\u2019 she said to herself as she left, \u2018is better than this.\u2019 \u2018Good job too,\u2019 muttered Zaphod to himself, turned over and failed to go to sleep.",
        "The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship, pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn\u2019t there.",
        "He ignored the computer\u2019s querulous demands to know just what the hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag across a pair of its terminals.",
        "After a while he began to turn down the lights.",
        "There was nothing to see.",
        "Nothing was about to happen.",
        "Lying in bed one night \u2013 and night was now virtually continuous on the ship \u2013 he decided to pull himself together, to get things into some sort of perspective.",
        "He sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on.",
        "He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to set out and find him.",
        "Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed.",
        "It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he heard the \u2018wop\u2019 said, and it made him very nervous.",
        "He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis.",
        "He laid his fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration.",
        "And now he could quite clearly hear slight noises, and could hear where they were coming from \u2013 they were coming from the bridge.",
        "Moving his hand along the wall he came across something he was glad to find.",
        "He moved on a little further, quietly.",
        "\u2018Computer?\u2019 he hissed.",
        "\u2018Mmmm?\u2019 said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly.",
        "\u2018Is there someone on this ship?\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm,\u2019 said the computer.",
        "\u2018Who is it?\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm mmm mmmmm,\u2019 said the computer.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm.\u2019 Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands.",
        "\u2018Oh, Zarquon,\u2019 he muttered to himself.",
        "Then he stared up the corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which the gagged terminals were situated.",
        "\u2018Computer,\u2019 he hissed again.",
        "\u2018Mmmmm?\u2019 \u2018When I ungag you \u2026\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm.\u2019 \u2018Remind me to punch myself in the mouth.\u2019 \u2018Mmmmm mmm?\u2019 \u2018Either one.",
        "Now just tell me this.",
        "One for yes, two for no.",
        "Is it dangerous?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm.\u2019 \u2018It is?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm.\u2019 \u2018You didn\u2019t just go \u201cmmmm\u201d twice?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm mmmm.\u2019 \u2018Hmmmm.\u2019 He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be yarding his way down it, which was true.",
        "He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to him, and he stopped dead.",
        "He hadn\u2019t been able to turn off the doors\u2019 courtesy voice circuits.",
        "This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter unobserved.",
        "He leant despondently back against the wall again and said some words which his other head was quite shocked to hear.",
        "He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out the sensor field which extended out into the corridor and told the door when there was someone there for whom it must open and to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark.",
        "He pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of the field.",
        "He held his breath, and congratulated himself on having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather than trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ship\u2019s gym.",
        "He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point.",
        "He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as quickly and as quietly as he could, \u2018Door, if you can hear me, say so very very quietly.\u2019 Very very quietly, the door murmured, \u2018I can hear you.\u2019 \u2018Good.",
        "Now, in a moment, I\u2019m going to ask you to open.",
        "When you open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?\u2019 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2018And I don\u2019t want you to say to me that I have made a simple door very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done, OK?\u2019 \u2018OK.\u2019 \u2018And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?\u2019 \u2018I understand.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 said Zaphod, tensing himself, \u2018open now.\u2019 The door slid open quietly.",
        "Zaphod slipped quietly through.",
        "The door closed quietly behind him.",
        "\u2018Is that the way you like it, Mr Beeblebrox?\u2019 said the door out loud.",
        "\u2018I want you to imagine,\u2019 said Zaphod to the group of white robots who swung round to stare at him at that point, \u2018that I have an extremely powerful Kill O Zap blaster pistol in my hand.\u2019 There was an immensely cold and savage silence.",
        "The robots regarded him with hideously dead eyes.",
        "They stood very still.",
        "There was something intensely macabre about their appearance, especially to Zaphod who had never seen one before or ever known anything about them.",
        "The Krikkit Wars belonged to the ancient past of the Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him, and since his teaching computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely different set of ideas which had then resulted in it being scrapped and sent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in love with the unfortunate machine, with the result (a) that Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a period of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to him at this moment.",
        "He stared at them in shock.",
        "It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical evil.",
        "From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless feet, they were clearly the calculated product of a mind that wanted simply to kill.",
        "Zaphod gulped in cold fear.",
        "They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship.",
        "Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that had been so mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold itself.",
        "The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his body, mind and capability.",
        "And when it spoke, what it said seemed to bear this impression out.",
        "Before going on to what it actually said, it is worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak for something over ten billion years.",
        "If he had paid more attention to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic being, he might have been more impressed by this honour.",
        "The robot\u2019s voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless.",
        "It had almost a cultured rasp to it.",
        "It sounded as ancient as it was.",
        "It said, \u2018You do have a Kill O Zap blaster pistol in your hand.\u2019 Zaphod didn\u2019t know what it meant for a moment, but then he glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had thought it was.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite tricky, \u2018well, I wouldn\u2019t want to overtax your imagination, robot.\u2019 For a while nobody said anything, and Zaphod realized that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and that it was up to him.",
        "\u2018I can\u2019t help noticing that you have parked your ship,\u2019 he said with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction, \u2018through mine.\u2019 There was no denying this.",
        "Without regard for any kind of proper dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was simply locked through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing more than two combs.",
        "Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of it in the form of questions.",
        "\u2018\u2026 haven\u2019t you?\u2019 he added.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 replied the robot.",
        "\u2018Er, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018So what are you cats doing here?\u2019 Silence.",
        "\u2018Robots,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018what are you robots doing here?\u2019 \u2018We have come,\u2019 rasped the robot, \u2018for the Gold Bail.\u2019 Zaphod nodded.",
        "He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration.",
        "The robot seemed to understand this.",
        "\u2018The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek,\u2019 continued the robot, \u2018to release our Masters from Krikkit.\u2019 Zaphod nodded again.",
        "He waggled his gun again.",
        "\u2018The Key,\u2019 continued the robot simply, \u2018was disintegrated in time and space.",
        "The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives your ship.",
        "It will be reconstituted in the Key.",
        "Our Masters shall be released.",
        "The Universal Readjustment will continue.\u2019 Zaphod nodded again.",
        "\u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 he said.",
        "A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot\u2019s totally expressionless face.",
        "He seemed to be finding the conversation depressing.",
        "\u2018Obliteration,\u2019 it said.",
        "\u2018We seek the Key,\u2019 it repeated.",
        "\u2018We already have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex Pillar.",
        "In a moment we will have the Gold Bail \u2026\u2019 \u2018No you won\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018We will,\u2019 stated the robot.",
        "\u2018No you won\u2019t.",
        "It makes my ship work.\u2019 \u2018In a moment,\u2019 repeated the robot patiently, \u2018we will have the Gold Bail \u2026\u2019 \u2018You will not,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018And then we must go,\u2019 said the robot, in all seriousness, \u2018to a party.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Zaphod, startled.",
        "\u2018Can I come?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the robot.",
        "\u2018We are going to shoot you.\u2019 \u2018Oh yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod, waggling his gun.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the robot, and they shot him.",
        "Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before he fell down.",
        "12 \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018Listen and watch.\u2019 Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit.",
        "The sky was dark and empty.",
        "The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze.",
        "They stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted around them.",
        "Arthur squatted and felt the Informational Illusion of the soil and the grass.",
        "He ran it through his fingers.",
        "The soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass strong.",
        "It was hard to avoid the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place in all respects.",
        "The sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently invisible, landscape.",
        "Still, he supposed, it\u2019s a question of what you\u2019re used to.",
        "He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up.",
        "Slartibartfast was quietly directing his attention to something down the other side of the hill.",
        "He looked and could just see some faint lights dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction.",
        "As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the dim lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of people who were walking home across the hill towards the town.",
        "They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song about how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to be going home to see their wives and children, with a lilting chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had died seeing as it liked them so much.",
        "Arthur could almost imagine Paul McCartney sitting with his feet up by the fire one evening, humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds, and thinking probably Essex.",
        "\u2018The Masters of Krikkit,\u2019 breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral tones.",
        "Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts about Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment\u2019s confusion.",
        "Then the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind, and he discovered that he still didn\u2019t understand what the old man meant.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018The Masters of Krikkit,\u2019 said Slartibartfast again, and if his breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like someone in Hades with bronchitis.",
        "Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little information he had at his disposal at this point.",
        "The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they seemed a little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a little whimsical perhaps, one wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to spend a long coach journey with them, but the point was that if they deviated in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough.",
        "So why all this rasping lungwork from Slartibartfast which would seem more appropriate to a radio commercial for one of those nasty films about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them? Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too.",
        "He hadn\u2019t quite fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and what \u2026 Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as if sensing what was going through his mind.",
        "\u2018The game you know as cricket,\u2019 he said, and his voice still seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, \u2018is just one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has been lost in the mists of time.",
        "Of all the races in the Galaxy, only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into what I\u2019m afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull and pointless game.",
        "\u2018Rather fond of it myself,\u2019 he added, \u2018but in most people\u2019s eyes you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesquely bad taste.",
        "Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the wicket, that\u2019s very nasty.\u2019 \u2018Um,\u2019 said Arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his cognitive synapses were coping with this as best they could, \u2018um.\u2019 \u2018And these,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt guttural and indicating the group of Krikkit men who had now walked past them, \u2018are the ones who started it all, and it will start tonight.",
        "Come, we will follow, and see why.\u2019 They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the cheery party along the dark hill path.",
        "Their natural instinct was to tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry, though, as they were simply walking through a recorded Informational Illusion, they could as easily have been wearing euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have taken of them.",
        "Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now singing a different song.",
        "It came lilting back to them through the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would have netted McCartney Kent and Sussex and enabled him to put in a fair offer for Hampshire.",
        "\u2018You must surely know,\u2019 said Slartibartfast to Ford, \u2018what it is that is about to happen?\u2019 \u2018Me?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Did you not learn ancient galactic history when you were a child?\u2019 \u2018I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018it was very distracting.",
        "Which isn\u2019t to say that I didn\u2019t learn some pretty stunning things.\u2019 At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that the party were singing.",
        "The middle eight bridge, which would have had McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester and gazing intently over the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New Forest beyond, had some curious lyrics.",
        "The songwriter was referring to meeting with a girl not \u2018under the moon\u2019 or \u2018beneath the stars\u2019 but \u2018above the grass\u2019, which struck Arthur as being a little prosaic.",
        "Then he looked up again at the bewilderingly blank sky, and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point here, if only he could grasp what it was.",
        "It gave him a feeling of being alone in the Universe, and he said so.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step, \u2018the people of Krikkit have never thought to themselves \u201cWe are alone in the Universe.\u201d They are surrounded by a huge dust cloud, you see, their single sun with its single world, and they are right out on the utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy.",
        "Because of the dust cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky.",
        "At night it is totally blank.",
        "During the day there is the sun, but you can\u2019t look directly at that so they don\u2019t.",
        "They are hardly aware of the sky.",
        "It\u2019s as if they had a blind spot which extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon.",
        "\u2018You see, the reason why they have never thought \u201cWe are alone in the Universe\u201d is that until tonight they don\u2019t know about the Universe.",
        "Until tonight.\u2019 He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him.",
        "\u2018Imagine,\u2019 he said, \u2018never even thinking \u201cWe are alone\u201d simply because it has never occurred to you to think that there\u2019s any other way to be.\u2019 He moved on again.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m afraid this is going to be a little unnerving,\u2019 he added.",
        "As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high up in the sightless sky above them.",
        "They glanced upwards in alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing.",
        "Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to do with it.",
        "They were glancing around themselves in consternation, left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the ground.",
        "It never occurred to them to look upwards.",
        "The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a mile from where they were standing was something that you had to be there to experience.",
        "Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the Starship Bistromath.",
        "Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a majestic and luxurious cruise liner launched from the great shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artrifactovol some hundreds of years ago now, and with good reason.",
        "It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history (see note below on the Campaign for Real Time) but it had the misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability Physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of knowledge was fully, or at all, understood.",
        "The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build a prototype Improbability Field into it, which was meant, supposedly, to ensure that it was Infinitely Improbable that anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship.",
        "They did not realize that because of the quasi reciprocal and circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that was Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen almost immediately.",
        "The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay beached like a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser lit tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to complete its very first radio message \u2013 an SOS \u2013 before undergoing a sudden and gratuitous total existence failure.",
        "However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another.",
        "It was conclusively proved that more people watched tri D TV coverage of the launch than actually existed at the time, and this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in the science of audience research.",
        "Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova which the star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later.",
        "Ysllodins is the star around which most of the Galaxy\u2019s major insurance underwriters live, or rather lived.",
        "But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to mind, such as the Galactic Fleet Battleships \u2013 the GSS Daring, the GSS Audacity and the GSS Suicidal Insanity \u2013 are all spoken of with awe, pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret, jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known emotions, the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was Krikkit One, the first spaceship ever built by the people of Krikkit.",
        "This is not because it was a wonderful ship.",
        "It wasn\u2019t.",
        "It was crazy piece of near junk.",
        "It looked as if it had been knocked up in somebody\u2019s backyard, and this was in fact precisely where it had been knocked up.",
        "The astonishing thing about the ship was not that it was done well (it wasn\u2019t) but that it was done at all.",
        "The period of time which had elapsed between the moment that the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was such a thing as space and the launching of this their first spaceship was almost exactly a year.",
        "Ford Prefect was extremely grateful as he strapped himself in, that this was just another Informational Illusion, and that he was therefore completely safe.",
        "In real life it wasn\u2019t a ship he would have set foot in for all the rice wine in China.",
        "\u2018Extremely rickety\u2019 was one phrase which sprang to mind, and \u2018Please may I get out?\u2019 was another.",
        "\u2018This is going to fly?\u2019 said Arthur, giving gaunt looks at the lashed together pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped interior of the ship.",
        "Slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were perfectly safe and that it was all going to be extremely instructive and not a little harrowing.",
        "Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed.",
        "\u2018Why not,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018go mad?\u2019 In front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their presence for the very good reason that they weren\u2019t actually there, were the three pilots.",
        "They also had constructed the ship.",
        "They had been on the hill path that night singing wholesome heartwarming songs.",
        "Their brains had been very slightly turned by the nearby crash of the alien spaceship.",
        "They had spent weeks stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that burnt up spaceship, all the while singing lilting spaceship stripping ditties.",
        "They had then built their own ship and this was it.",
        "This was their ship, and they were currently singing a little song about that too, expressing the twin joys of achievement and ownership.",
        "The chorus was a little poignant, and told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long hours in the garage, away from the company of their wives and children, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was growing up.",
        "Pow, they took off.",
        "They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it was doing.",
        "\u2018No way,\u2019 said Ford a while later after they had recovered from the shock of acceleration, and were climbing up out of the planet\u2019s atmosphere, \u2018no way,\u2019 he repeated, \u2018does anyone design and build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated.",
        "I don\u2019t believe it.",
        "Prove it to me and I still won\u2019t believe it.\u2019 He shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at the nothingness outside it.",
        "The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast fast wound them through it.",
        "Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of the hollow, spherical dust cloud which surrounded their sun and home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out.",
        "It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and consistency of space.",
        "The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple past them.",
        "It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit.",
        "The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip on Arthur\u2019s heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of the Krikkit pilots which hung in the air like a thick static charge.",
        "They were now on the very boundary of the historical consciousness of their race.",
        "This was the very limit beyond which none of them had ever speculated, or even known that there was any speculation to be done.",
        "The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship.",
        "Inside was the silence of history.",
        "Their historic mission was to find out if there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe, strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit.",
        "History was gathering itself to deliver another blow.",
        "Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing darkness.",
        "It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker, heavier and heavier.",
        "And suddenly it was gone.",
        "They flew out of the cloud.",
        "They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear.",
        "For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the Universe.",
        "And then they turned round.",
        "\u2018It\u2019ll have to go,\u2019 the men of Krikkit said as they headed back for home.",
        "On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms.",
        "13 \u2018So you see,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, slowly stirring his artificially constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the interactive perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and space, \u2018how it is.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018What do I do,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018with this piece of chicken?\u2019 Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely.",
        "\u2018Toy with it,\u2019 he said, \u2018toy with it.\u2019 He demonstrated with his own piece.",
        "Arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four dimensionally through what Slartibartfast had assured him was five dimensional space.",
        "\u2018Overnight,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018the whole population of Krikkit was transformed from being charming, delightful, intelligent \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 if whimsical \u2026\u2019 interpolated Arthur.",
        "\u2018\u2026 ordinary people,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018into charming, delightful, intelligent \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 whimsical \u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026 manic xenophobes.",
        "The idea of a Universe didn\u2019t fit into their world picture, so to speak.",
        "They simply couldn\u2019t cope with it.",
        "And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically if you like, they decided to destroy it.",
        "What\u2019s the matter now?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like this wine very much,\u2019 said Arthur sniffing it.",
        "\u2018Well, send it back.",
        "It\u2019s all part of the mathematics of it.\u2019 Arthur did so.",
        "He didn\u2019t like the topography of the waiter\u2019s smile, but he\u2019d never liked graphs anyway.",
        "\u2018Where are we going?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Back to the Room of Informational Illusions,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, rising and patting his mouth with the mathematical representation of a paper napkin, \u2018for the second half.\u2019 14 \u2018The people of Krikkit,\u2019 said His High Judgmental Supremacy, Judiciary Pag, LIVR (the Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed), Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial, \u2018are, well, you know, they\u2019re just a bunch of real sweet guys, you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody.",
        "Hell, I feel the same way some mornings.",
        "Shit.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front of him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial Beach Loafers, \u2018so you wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to share a Galaxy with these guys.\u2019 This was true.",
        "The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning.",
        "Thousands and thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of existence.",
        "The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a meadow.",
        "\u2018I mean,\u2019 continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the ultra modern (this was ten billion years ago, when \u2018ultra modern\u2019 meant lots of stainless steel and brushed concrete) and huge courtroom, \u2018these guys are just obsessed.\u2019 This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose \u2013 the destruction of everything that wasn\u2019t Krikkit.",
        "It is also the only explanation for their bewilderingly sudden grasp of all the hypertechnology involved in building their thousands of spaceships, and their millions of lethal white robots.",
        "These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who had encountered them \u2013 in most cases, however, the terror was extremely short lived, as was the person experiencing the terror.",
        "They were savage, single minded flying battle machines.",
        "They wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which, brandished one way, would knock down buildings and, brandished another way, fired blistering Omni Destruct O Zap rays and, brandished a third way, launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor incendiary devices to Maxi Slorta Hypernuclear Devices which could take out a major sun.",
        "Simply striking the grenades with the battleclubs simultaneously primed them and launched them with phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to hundreds of thousands of miles.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 said Judiciary Pag again, \u2018so we won.\u2019 He paused and chewed a little gum.",
        "\u2018We won,\u2019 he repeated, \u2018but that\u2019s no big deal.",
        "I mean a medium sized galaxy against one little world, and how long did it take us? Clerk of the Court?\u2019 \u2018M\u2019lud?\u2019 said the severe little man in black, rising.",
        "\u2018How long, kiddo?\u2019 \u2018It is a trifle difficult, m\u2019lud, to be precise in this matter.",
        "Time and distance \u2026\u2019 \u2018Relax, guy, be vague.\u2019 \u2018I hardly like to be vague, m\u2019lud, over such a \u2026\u2019 \u2018Bite the bullet and be it.\u2019 The Clerk of the Court blinked at him.",
        "It was clear that like most of the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108, as his private name was known, inexplicably, to be) a rather distressing figure.",
        "He was clearly a bounder and a cad.",
        "He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared to be right.",
        "\u2018Er, well, m\u2019lud, very approximately, two thousand years,\u2019 the Clerk murmured unhappily.",
        "\u2018And how many guys zilched out?\u2019 \u2018Two grillion, m\u2019lud.\u2019 The Clerk sat down.",
        "A hydro spectic photo of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming slightly.",
        "Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or bodies, depending on metabolism and custom.",
        "Behind a wall of Zap Proof Crystal stood a representative group of the people of Krikkit, looking with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens gathered to pass judgment on them.",
        "This was the most momentous occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it.",
        "He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s a whole lotta stiffs,\u2019 he said quietly.",
        "The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this view.",
        "\u2018So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you wouldn\u2019t want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they\u2019re just gonna keep at it, not if they\u2019re not gonna learn to relax a little.",
        "I mean it\u2019s just gonna be continual nervous time, isn\u2019t it, right? Pow, pow, pow, when are they next coming at us? Peaceful coexistence is just right out, right? Get me some water somebody, thank you.\u2019 He sat back and sipped reflectively.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018hear me, hear me.",
        "It\u2019s, like, these guys, you know, are entitled to their own view of the Universe.",
        "And according to their view, which the Universe forced on them, right, they did right.",
        "Sounds crazy, but I think you\u2019ll agree.",
        "They believe in \u2026\u2019 He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket of his Judicial jeans.",
        "\u2018They believe in \u201cpeace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms\u201d.\u2019 He shrugged.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve heard a lot worse,\u2019 he said.",
        "He scratched his crotch reflectively.",
        "\u2018Freeeow,\u2019 he said.",
        "He took another sip of water, then held it up to the light and frowned at it.",
        "He twisted it round.",
        "\u2018Hey, is there something in this water?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Er, no, m\u2019lud,\u2019 said the Court Usher who had brought it to him, rather nervously.",
        "\u2018Then take it away,\u2019 snapped Judiciary Pag, \u2018and put something in it.",
        "I got an idea.\u2019 He pushed away the glass and leaned forward.",
        "\u2018Hear me, hear me,\u2019 he said.",
        "The solution was brilliant, and went like this: The planet of Krikkit was to be encased for perpetuity in an envelope of Slo Time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly.",
        "All light would be deflected round the envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable.",
        "Escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible unless it were unlocked from the outside.",
        "When the rest of the Universe came to its final end, when the whole of creation reached its dying fall (this was all, of course, in the days before it was known that the end of the Universe would be a spectacular catering venture) and life and matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Krikkit and its sun would emerge from its Slo Time envelope and continue a solitary existence, such as it craved, in the twilight of the Universal void.",
        "The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the envelope.",
        "The Key would be the symbol of the Galaxy \u2013 the Wikkit Gate.",
        "By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary Pag was already in the Sens O Shower with a rather nice member of the jury that he\u2019d slipped a note to half an hour earlier.",
        "15 Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108 had cut the bottoms off his Galactic state jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having Essence of Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member of the jury.",
        "She was a Soolfinian girl from beyond the Cloudworlds of Yaga.",
        "She had skin like lemon silk and was very interested in legal bodies.",
        "\u2018Did you hear the news?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Weeeelaaaaah!\u2019 said Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108, and you would have had to have been there to know exactly why he said this.",
        "None of this was on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all based on hearsay.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he added, when the thing that had made him say \u2018Weeeeelaaaaah\u2019 had stopped happening.",
        "He moved his body round slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of primeval Vod\u2019s three suns which was now creeping over the ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with some of the greatest tanning power ever known.",
        "A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed along the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go next.",
        "On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again.",
        "It drifted back to sea.",
        "\u2018I hope it isn\u2019t good news,\u2019 muttered Zipo Bibrok 5 \u00d7 108, \u2018\u2019cos I don\u2019t think I could bear it.\u2019 \u2018Your Krikkit judgment was carried out today,\u2019 said the girl sumptuously.",
        "There was no need to say such a straightforward thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway because it was that sort of day.",
        "\u2018I heard it on the radio,\u2019 she said, \u2018when I went back to the ship for the oil.\u2019 \u2018Uhuh,\u2019 murmured Zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled sand.",
        "\u2018Something happened,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Mmmm?\u2019 \u2018Just after the Slo Time envelope was locked,\u2019 she said, and paused a moment from rubbing in the Essence of Qualactin, \u2018a Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned out to be just missing after all.",
        "It appeared and tried to seize the Key.\u2019 Zipo sat up sharply.",
        "\u2018Hey, what?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 she said in a voice which would have calmed the Big Bang down.",
        "\u2018Apparently there was a short battle.",
        "The Key and the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space\u2013time continuum.",
        "Apparently they are lost for ever.\u2019 She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to her fingertips.",
        "He relaxed and lay back down.",
        "\u2018Do what you did a moment or two ago,\u2019 he murmured.",
        "\u2018That?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018No, no,\u2019 he said, \u2018that.\u2019 She tried again.",
        "\u2018That?\u2019 she asked.",
        "\u2018Weeeeelaaaaaah!\u2019 Again, you had to be there.",
        "The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again.",
        "A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him.",
        "16 \u2018Nothing is lost for ever,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, his face flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot waiter was trying to take away, \u2018except for the Cathedral of Chalesm.\u2019 \u2018The what?\u2019 said Arthur with a start.",
        "\u2018The Cathedral of Chalesm,\u2019 repeated Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018It was during the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time that I\u2014\u2019 \u2018The what?\u2019 said Arthur again.",
        "The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped would be one last onslaught on this story.",
        "The robot waiter moved through the space\u2013time matrices in a way which spectacularly combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the candle and got it.",
        "They had had the bill, had argued convincingly about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into parking orbit round a strange planet.",
        "The waiter was now anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro.",
        "\u2018All will become clear,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018When?\u2019 \u2018In a minute.",
        "Listen.",
        "The time streams are now very polluted.",
        "There\u2019s a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam, and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the physical world.",
        "Eddies in the space\u2013time continuum, you see.\u2019 \u2018So I hear,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Look, where are we going?\u2019 said Ford, pushing his chair back from the table with impatience.",
        "\u2018Because I\u2019m eager to get there.\u2019 \u2018We are going,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, in a slow, measured voice, \u2018to try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from the Slo Time envelope and release the rest of their army and their mad Masters.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that you mentioned a party.\u2019 \u2018I did,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, and hung his head.",
        "He realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed to exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of Ford Prefect.",
        "The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls.",
        "The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party until he absolutely had to.",
        "But there it was, the fact was out, and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it the way an Arcturan Megaleach attaches itself to its victim before biting his head off and making off with his spaceship.",
        "\u2018When,\u2019 said Ford eagerly, \u2018do we get there?\u2019 \u2018When I\u2019ve finished telling you why we have to go there.\u2019 \u2018I know why I\u2019m going,\u2019 said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his hands behind his head.",
        "He gave one of his smiles which made people twitch.",
        "Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement.",
        "He had been planning to learn to play the octaventral heebie phone \u2013 a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had the wrong number of mouths.",
        "He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as important.",
        "Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part time work for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all seriously for the first time in his life.",
        "As a result he now found himself spending his fast declining years combating evil and trying to save the Galaxy.",
        "He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily.",
        "\u2018Listen,\u2019 he said, \u2018at Camtim\u2014\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later.",
        "I noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent times plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the five pieces of the missing Key.",
        "Only two I could trace exactly \u2013 the Wooden Pillar, which appeared on your planet, and the Silver Bail.",
        "It seems to be at some sort of party.",
        "We must go there to retrieve it before the Krikkit robots find it, or who knows what may happen?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford firmly.",
        "\u2018We must go to the party in order to drink a lot and dance with girls.\u2019 \u2018But haven\u2019t you understood everything I \u2026 ?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, \u2018I\u2019ve understood it all perfectly well.",
        "That\u2019s why I want to have as many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there are still any left.",
        "If everything you\u2019ve shown us is true \u2026\u2019 \u2018True? Of course it\u2019s true.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 then we don\u2019t stand a whelk\u2019s chance in a supernova.\u2019 \u2018A what?\u2019 said Arthur sharply again.",
        "He had been following the conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose the thread now.",

        "\u2018The\u2014\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s a whelk got to do with a supernova?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018It doesn\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford levelly, \u2018stand a chance in one.\u2019 He paused to see if the matter was now cleared up.",
        "The freshly puzzled looks clambering across Arthur\u2019s face told him that it wasn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018A supernova,\u2019 said Ford as quickly and as clearly as he could, \u2018is a star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as a super heavy neutron star.",
        "It\u2019s a star which burns up other stars, got it? Nothing stands a chance in a supernova.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018The\u2014\u2019 \u2018So why a whelk particularly?\u2019 \u2018Why not a whelk? Doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early fierce momentum as best he could.",
        "\u2018The point is,\u2019 he said, \u2018that people like you and me, Slartibartfast, and Arthur \u2013 particularly and especially Arthur \u2013 are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you like.\u2019 Slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in umbrage.",
        "He started to speak.",
        "\u2018 \u2013 \u2026\u2019 is as far as he got.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re not obsessed by anything, you see,\u2019 insisted Ford.",

        "We can\u2019t win against obsession.",
        "They care, we don\u2019t.",
        "They win.\u2019 \u2018I care about lots of things,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, his voice trembling partly with annoyance, but partly also with uncertainty.",
        "\u2018Such as?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018Life, the Universe.",
        "Everything, really.",
        "Fjords.\u2019 \u2018Would you die for them?\u2019 \u2018Fjords?\u2019 blinked Slartibartfast in surprise.",
        "\u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Well, then.\u2019 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t see the point, to be honest.\u2019 \u2018And I still can\u2019t see the connection,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018with whelks.\u2019 Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point.",
        "\u2018The point is,\u2019 he hissed, \u2018that we are not obsessive people, and we don\u2019t stand a chance against \u2026\u2019 \u2018Except for your sudden obsession with whelks,\u2019 pursued Arthur, \u2018which I still haven\u2019t understood.\u2019 \u2018Will you please leave whelks out of it?\u2019 \u2018I will if you will,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018You brought the subject up.\u2019 \u2018It was an error,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018forget them.",
        "The point is this.\u2019 He leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his fingers.",
        "\u2018What was I talking about?\u2019 he said wearily.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s just go down to the party,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018for whatever reason.\u2019 He stood up, shaking his head.",
        "\u2018I think that\u2019s what I was trying to say,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the bathroom.",
        "17 Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace.",
        "History is being polluted.",
        "The Encyclopaedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to anyone who hasn\u2019t spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place.",
        "One rationalization of this problem states that time travel was, by its very nature, discovered simultaneously at all periods of history, but this is clearly bunk.",
        "The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as well.",
        "Here is an example.",
        "It may not seem to be an important one to some people, but to others it is crucial.",
        "It is certainly significant in that it was this single event which caused the Campaign for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it last? It depends which way round you see history as happening, and this too is now an increasingly vexed question).",
        "There is, or was, a poet.",
        "His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what are widely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the finest poems in existence, the Songs of the Long Land.",
        "They are/were unspeakably wonderful.",
        "That is to say, you couldn\u2019t speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with emotion, truth and a sense of the wholeness and oneness of things that you wouldn\u2019t pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block, possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of perspective and soda.",
        "They were that good.",
        "Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa.",
        "He lived there, and he wrote his poems there.",
        "He wrote them on pages made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or correcting fluid.",
        "He wrote about the light in the forest and what he thought about that.",
        "He wrote about the darkness in the forest, and what he thought about that.",
        "He wrote about the girl who had left him and precisely what he thought about that.",
        "Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over.",
        "News of them spread like morning sunlight.",
        "For centuries they illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives might otherwise have been darker and drier.",
        "Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might have been better still if he had had access to some high quality correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few words to that effect.",
        "They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the situation \u2013 with some difficulty \u2013 to him, and did indeed persuade him.",
        "In fact they persuaded him to such effect that he became extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom he was otherwise destined to write with such precision never got around to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the future to do chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily.",
        "He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a problem, but an easily solved one.",
        "The manufacturers of correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with a copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake and correction on the way.",
        "Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless.",
        "Others argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so what\u2019s changed? The first people say that that isn\u2019t the point.",
        "They aren\u2019t quite certain what the point is, but they are quite sure that that isn\u2019t it.",
        "They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try to stop this sort of thing going on.",
        "Their case was considerably strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set themselves up, news broke that not only had the great Cathedral of Chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery, but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long, and had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion production to start on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had now never been built in the first place.",
        "Picture postcards of the cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable.",
        "So a lot of history is now gone for ever.",
        "The Campaign for Real Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences between one country and another, and between one world and another, so time travel is now eroding the differences between one age and another.",
        "\u2018The past,\u2019 they say, \u2018is now truly like a foreign country.",
        "They do things exactly the same there.\u2019 18 Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these hateful and painful materializations that he was determined not to let himself get used to.",
        "He looked around for the others.",
        "They weren\u2019t there.",
        "He looked around for the others again.",
        "They still weren\u2019t there.",
        "He closed his eyes.",
        "He opened them.",
        "He looked around for the others.",
        "They obstinately persisted in their absence.",
        "He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his eyes had been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown crept across his face.",
        "So he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown stayed put.",
        "If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm grip.",
        "If this was a party it was a very bad one, so bad, in fact, that everyone else had left.",
        "He abandoned this line of thought as futile.",
        "Obviously this wasn\u2019t a party.",
        "It was a cave, or a labyrinth, or a tunnel or something \u2013 there was insufficient light to tell.",
        "All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness.",
        "The only sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which sounded worried.",
        "He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if to say \u2026 \u2018Yes?\u2019 This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved him.",
        "He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned to him it was a hollow dirge and he stopped.",
        "His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that Slartibartfast had been telling him.",
        "He half expected suddenly to see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill him.",
        "He caught his breath.",
        "They didn\u2019t.",
        "He let it go again.",
        "He didn\u2019t know what he did expect.",
        "Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie green neon sign.",
        "It said, silently: YOU HAVE BEEN DIVERTED The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at all certain he liked.",
        "It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous flourish.",
        "Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just a ridiculous trick of his imagination.",
        "A neon sign is either on or off, depending on whether it has electricity running through it or not.",
        "There was no way, he told himself, that it could possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a contemptuous flourish.",
        "He hugged himself tightly in his dressing gown and shivered, nevertheless.",
        "The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with just three dots and a comma.",
        "Like this: \u2026, Only in green neon.",
        "It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly for a second or two, to indicate that there was more to come, that the sentence was not complete.",
        "Trying with almost superhuman pedantry, he further reflected.",
        "Or at least, inhuman pedantry.",
        "The sentence then completed itself with these two words: ARTHUR DENT.",
        "He reeled.",
        "He steadied himself to have another clear look at it.",
        "It still said ARTHUR DENT, so he reeled again.",
        "Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him blinking in the darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his retina.",
        "WELCOME, the sign now suddenly said.",
        "After a moment, it added: I DON\u2019T THINK.",
        "The stone cold fear which had been hovering around Arthur all this time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now come and pounced on him.",
        "He tried to fight it off.",
        "He dropped into a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees.",
        "He peered huntedly into the darkness.",
        "\u2018Er, hello?\u2019 he said.",
        "He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without the \u2018er\u2019.",
        "At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum.",
        "He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just his heart beating.",
        "He listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasn\u2019t his heart, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a bass drum.",
        "Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves, and leapt off.",
        "He put a hand out on to the floor to steady his alert crouch, which wasn\u2019t holding up very well.",
        "The sign changed itself again.",
        "It said: DO NOT BE ALARMED.",
        "After a pause, it added: BE VERY, VERY FRIGHTENED, ARTHUR DENT.",
        "Once again it flicked off.",
        "Once again it left him in darkness.",
        "His eyes seemed to be popping out of his head.",
        "He wasn\u2019t certain if this was because they were trying to see more clearly, or if they simply wanted to leave at this point.",
        "\u2018Hello?\u2019 he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged and aggressive self assertion into it.",
        "\u2018Is anyone there?\u2019 There was no reply, nothing.",
        "This unnerved Arthur even more than a reply would have done, and he began to back away from the scary nothingness.",
        "And the more he backed away, the more scared he became.",
        "After a while he realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he had seen in which the hero backs further and further away from some imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming up from behind.",
        "Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather quickly.",
        "There was nothing there.",
        "Just blackness.",
        "This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that, back the way he had come.",
        "After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him that he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been backing away from in the first place.",
        "This, he couldn\u2019t help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do.",
        "He decided he would be better off backing the way he had first been backing, and turned around again.",
        "It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the correct one, because there was an indescribably hideous monster dancing quietly behind him.",
        "Arthur yawed wildly as his skin tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl out of.",
        "\u2018Bet you weren\u2019t expecting to see me again,\u2019 said the monster, which Arthur couldn\u2019t help thinking was a strange remark for it to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before.",
        "He could tell that he hadn\u2019t met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights.",
        "It was \u2026 it was \u2026 it was \u2026 Arthur blinked at it.",
        "It stood very still.",
        "It did look a little familiar.",
        "A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he was looking at was a six foot high hologram of a housefly.",
        "He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six foot high hologram of a housefly at this time.",
        "He wondered whose voice he had heard.",
        "It was a terribly realistic hologram.",
        "It vanished.",
        "\u2018Or perhaps you remember me better,\u2019 said the voice suddenly, and it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, \u2018as the rabbit.\u2019 With a sudden ping, there was a rabbit there in the black labyrinth with him, a huge, monstrously, hideously soft and lovable rabbit \u2013 an image again, but one on which every single soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing in its soft and lovable coat.",
        "Arthur was startled to see his own reflection in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge brown eye.",
        "\u2018Born in darkness,\u2019 rumbled the voice, \u2018raised in darkness.",
        "One morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some primitive instrument made of flint.",
        "\u2018Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you.",
        "Rather hard, as I recall.",
        "\u2018You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in.",
        "I happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a fly again and you swatted me.",
        "Again.",
        "Only this time you swatted me with the bag you\u2019d made of my previous skin.",
        "\u2018Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you are also staggeringly tactless.\u2019 The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped.",
        "\u2018I see you have lost the bag,\u2019 said the voice.",
        "\u2018Probably got bored with it, did you?\u2019 Arthur shook his head helplessly.",
        "He wanted to explain that he had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it very well and had taken it with him wherever he went, but that somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even as they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of rather nasty fake leopard skin, and wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d had a few moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was, and wasn\u2019t one he would have chosen himself, and Heaven knew what would be in it as it wasn\u2019t his, and he would much rather have his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or rather its component parts, i.e.",
        "the rabbit skin, from its previous owner, viz.",
        "the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting vainly to address.",
        "All he actually managed to say was \u2018Erp.\u2019 \u2018Meet the newt you trod on,\u2019 said the voice.",
        "And there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant green scaly newt.",
        "Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit.",
        "He yelped again, but could find nowhere to leap to.",
        "\u2018That was me, too,\u2019 continued the voice in a low menacing rumble, \u2018as if you didn\u2019t know.\u2019 \u2018Know?\u2019 said Arthur with a start.",
        "\u2018Know?\u2019 \u2018The interesting thing about reincarnation,\u2019 rasped the voice, \u2018is that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is happening to them.\u2019 He paused for effect.",
        "As far as Arthur was concerned there was already quite enough effect going on.",
        "\u2018I was aware,\u2019 hissed the voice, \u2018that is, I became aware.",
        "Slowly.",
        "Gradually.\u2019 He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath.",
        "\u2018I could hardly help it, could I,\u2019 he bellowed, \u2018when the same thing kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent.",
        "Any world, any body, any time, I\u2019m just getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent \u2013 pow, he kills me.",
        "\u2018Hard not to notice.",
        "Bit of a memory jogger.",
        "Bit of a pointer.",
        "Bit of a bloody giveaway! \u2018\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d my spirit would say to itself as it winged its way back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent ended venture into the land of the living, \u201cthat man who just ran over me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a little familiar \u2026\u201d And gradually I got to piece it together, Dent, you multiple me murderer!\u2019 The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors.",
        "Arthur stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief.",
        "\u2018Here\u2019s the moment, Dent,\u2019 shrieked the voice, now reaching a feverish pitch of hatred, \u2018here\u2019s the moment when at last I knew!\u2019 It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up in front of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but here\u2019s an attempt at a description of how hideous it was.",
        "It was a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale like creature rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white tombstones.",
        "High above the cave rose a vast promontory in which could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves, which \u2026 Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it.",
        "He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes.",
        "When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone.",
        "The corridor was dark and, briefly, silent.",
        "He was alone with his thoughts.",
        "They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would rather have had a chaperone.",
        "The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large section of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just dark blankness behind it.",
        "Arthur looked into it in much the same way that a mouse looks into a dark dog kennel.",
        "And the voice spoke to him again.",
        "\u2018Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent,\u2019 it said.",
        "\u2018I dare you to tell me it was a coincidence!\u2019 \u2018It was a coincidence,\u2019 said Arthur quickly.",
        "\u2018It was not!\u2019 came the answering bellow.",
        "\u2018It was,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it was \u2026\u2019 \u2018If it was a coincidence, then my name,\u2019 roared the voice, \u2018is not Agrajag!!!\u2019 \u2018And presumably,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you would claim that that was your name.\u2019 \u2018Yes!\u2019 hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft syllogism.",
        "\u2018Well, I\u2019m afraid it was still a coincidence,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Come in here and say that!\u2019 howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy again.",
        "Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least, he nearly said that it was a coincidence.",
        "His tongue rather lost its footing towards the end of the last word because the lights came up and revealed what it was he had walked into.",
        "It was a Cathedral of Hate.",
        "It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but actually sprained.",
        "It was huge.",
        "It was horrific.",
        "It had a Statue in it.",
        "We will come to the Statue in a moment.",
        "The vast, incomprehensibly vast, chamber looked as if it had been carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of.",
        "It seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood and gaped at it.",
        "It was black.",
        "Where it wasn\u2019t black you were inclined to wish that it was, because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of eye defying colours, from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead.",
        "The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch.",
        "The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the pillars, from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls, towards the Statue, to which we will come in a moment.",
        "And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch then it was clear from the gargoyles\u2019 faces that the Statue would have put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it; which they weren\u2019t, and had anybody tried to serve them some, which they wouldn\u2019t.",
        "Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent.",
        "The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had asterisks against them.",
        "So, for instance, the name of a cow which had been slaughtered and of which Arthur had happened to eat a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving, whereas the name of a fish which Arthur had himself caught and then decided he didn\u2019t like and left on the side of the plate had a double underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added as decoration, just to make the point.",
        "And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the Statue, to which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the same person, over and over again.",
        "And it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly, extremely upset and annoyed.",
        "In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe.",
        "It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning, searing flame of annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time and space in its infinite umbrage.",
        "And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the Statue in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one.",
        "Fifty feet tall if it was an inch, there was not an inch of it which wasn\u2019t crammed with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad.",
        "From the small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his dressing gown, there was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn\u2019t lambasted and vilified by the sculptor.",
        "Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravening, bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one man Universe.",
        "With each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of artistic fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out of his hair, or doing something which Arthur at first looking couldn\u2019t quite identify.",
        "His many feet were mostly stamping on ants.",
        "Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness of things.",
        "And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood the figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he had supposedly been persecuting all this time.",
        "\u2018HhhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!\u2019 said Agrajag.",
        "He, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat.",
        "He waddled slowly around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws.",
        "\u2018Look \u2026\u2019 protested Arthur.",
        "\u2018HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!\u2019 explained Agrajag, and Arthur reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition.",
        "Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery.",
        "His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic broken floundering things they were than if they had been strong, muscular beaters of the air.",
        "The frightening thing was probably the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical odds.",
        "He had the most astounding collection of teeth.",
        "They looked as if they each came from a completely different animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything he\u2019d lacerate half his own face along with it, and possibly put an eye out as well.",
        "Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as sane as a fish in a privet bush.",
        "\u2018I was at a cricket match,\u2019 he rasped.",
        "This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that Arthur practically choked.",
        "\u2018Not in this body,\u2019 screeched the creature, \u2018not in this body! This is my last body.",
        "My last life.",
        "This is my revenge body.",
        "My kill Arthur Dent body.",
        "My last chance.",
        "I had to fight to get it, too.\u2019 \u2018But \u2026\u2019 \u2018I was at,\u2019 roared Agrajag, \u2018a cricket match! I had a weak heart condition, but what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a cricket match? As I\u2019m watching, what happens? \u2018Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in front of me.",
        "The last thing I can\u2019t help but notice before my poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is Arthur Dent wearing a rabbit bone in his beard.",
        "Coincidence?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Coincidence?\u2019 screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its broken wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a particularly nasty tooth.",
        "On closer examination, such as he\u2019d been hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag\u2019s face was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters.",
        "He backed away nervously.",
        "He tugged at his beard.",
        "He was appalled to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it.",
        "He pulled it out and threw it away.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s just fate playing silly buggers with you.",
        "With me.",
        "With me.",
        "It\u2019s a complete coincidence.\u2019 \u2018What have you got against me, Dent?\u2019 snarled the creature, advancing on him in a painful waddle.",
        "\u2018Nothing,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018honestly, nothing.\u2019 Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare.",
        "\u2018Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you\u2019ve got nothing against, killing them all the time.",
        "Very curious piece of social interaction, I would call that.",
        "I\u2019d also call it a lie!\u2019 \u2018But look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019m very sorry.",
        "There\u2019s been a terrible misunderstanding.",
        "I\u2019ve got to go.",
        "Have you got a clock? I\u2019m meant to be helping save the Universe.\u2019 He backed away still further.",
        "Agrajag advanced still further.",
        "\u2018At one point,\u2019 he hissed, \u2018at one point, I decided to give up.",
        "I would not come back.",
        "I would stay in the netherworld.",
        "And what happened?\u2019 Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no idea and didn\u2019t want to have one either.",
        "He found he had backed up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew what Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom slippers.",
        "He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image towering above him.",
        "He was still puzzled as to what one of his hands was meant to be doing.",
        "\u2018I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world,\u2019 pursued Agrajag, \u2018as a bunch of petunias.",
        "In, I might add, a bowl.",
        "This particular happy little lifetime started off with me, in my bowl, unsupported, three hundred miles above the surface of a particularly grim planet.",
        "Not a naturally tenable position for a bowl of petunias, you might think.",
        "And you\u2019d be right.",
        "That life ended a very short while later, three hundred miles lower.",
        "In, I might again add, the fresh wreckage of a whale.",
        "My spirit brother.\u2019 He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred.",
        "\u2018On the way down,\u2019 he snarled, \u2018I couldn\u2019t help noticing a flashy looking white spaceship.",
        "And looking out of a port on this flashy looking spaceship was a smug looking Arthur Dent.",
        "Coincidence?!!\u2019 \u2018Yes!\u2019 yelped Arthur.",
        "He glanced up again, and realized that the arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into existence a bowl of doomed petunias.",
        "This was not a concept which leapt easily to the eye.",
        "\u2018I must go,\u2019 insisted Arthur.",
        "\u2018You may go,\u2019 said Agrajag, \u2018after I have killed you.\u2019 \u2018No, that won\u2019t be any use,\u2019 explained Arthur, beginning to climb up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, \u2018because I have to save the Universe, you see.",
        "I have to find a Silver Bail, that\u2019s the point.",
        "Tricky thing to do dead.\u2019 \u2018Save the Universe!\u2019 spat Agrajag with contempt.",
        "\u2018You should have thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone \u2026\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve never been there,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018\u2026 tried to assassinate you and you ducked.",
        "Who do you think the bullet bit? What did you say?\u2019 \u2018Never been there,\u2019 repeated Arthur.",
        "\u2018What are you talking about? I have to go.\u2019 Agrajag stopped in his tracks.",
        "\u2018You must have been there.",
        "You were responsible for my death there, as everywhere else.",
        "An innocent bystander!\u2019 He quivered.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve never heard of the place,\u2019 insisted Arthur.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve certainly never had anyone try to assassinate me.",
        "Other than you.",
        "Perhaps I go there later, do you think?\u2019 Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror.",
        "\u2018You haven\u2019t been to Stavromula Beta \u2026 yet?\u2019 he whispered.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about the place.",
        "Certainly never been to it, and don\u2019t have any plans to go.\u2019 \u2018Oh, you go there all right,\u2019 muttered Agrajag in a broken voice, \u2018you go there all right.",
        "Oh, Zark!\u2019 He tottered, and stared wildly about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve brought you here too soon!\u2019 He started to scream and bellow.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve brought you here too Zarking soon!\u2019 Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m going to kill you anyway!\u2019 he roared.",
        "\u2018Even if it\u2019s a logical impossibility I\u2019m going to Zarking well try! I\u2019m going to blow this whole mountain up!\u2019 He screamed, \u2018Let\u2019s see you get out of this one, Dent!\u2019 He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a small black sacrificial altar.",
        "He was shouting so wildly now that he was really carving his face up badly.",
        "Arthur leaped down from his vantage place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try to restrain the three quarters crazed creature.",
        "He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity crashing down on top of the altar.",
        "Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and turned a wild eye on Arthur.",
        "\u2018You know what you\u2019ve done? he gurgled painfully.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ve only gone and killed me again.",
        "I mean, what do you want from me, blood?\u2019 He thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and collapsed, smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so.",
        "Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to have done, and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency.",
        "He stared wildly around him.",
        "The only exit appeared to be the way he came in.",
        "He pelted towards it, throwing away the nasty fake leopard skin bag as he did so.",
        "As he dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by klaxons, sirens, flashing lights.",
        "Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light in front of him.",
        "It wasn\u2019t flashing.",
        "It was daylight.",
        "19 Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our Galaxy is Krikkit (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that for this reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only apply to our Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension.",
        "In some of the higher dimensions they feel they can more or less please themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian Ultra Cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of billions of years is.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s be blunt, it\u2019s a nasty game\u2019 (says The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy), \u2018but then anyone who has been to \u00a3any of the higher dimensions will know that they\u2019re a pretty nasty heathen lot up there who should just be smashed and done in, and would be, too, if anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at right angles to reality.\u2019 This is another example of the fact that The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in off the street and get ripped off, especially if they happen to walk in off the street during the afternoon, when very few of the regular staff are there.",
        "There is a fundamental point here: The history of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is one of idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure and enormously long lunch breaks.",
        "The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its financial records, lost in the mists of time.",
        "For other, and more curious theories about where they are lost, see below.",
        "Most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding editor called Hurling Frootmig.",
        "Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust.",
        "There followed many years of penury and heart searching during which he consulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal states of mind, thought about this and that, fooled about with weights, and then, after a chance encounter with the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondoon (who claimed that just as lunch was at the centre of a man\u2019s temporal day, and man\u2019s temporal day could be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so lunch should (a) be seen as the centre of a man\u2019s spiritual life, and (b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide, laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both, and led the Guide on to its first major commercial success.",
        "He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial lunch break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in the Guide\u2019s history, since it meant that most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices of an afternoon and saw something worth doing.",
        "Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on a very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor, Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch breaks of such breathtaking scope that even the efforts of recent editors, who have started undertaking sponsored lunch breaks for charity, seem like mere sandwiches in comparison.",
        "In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship \u2013 he merely left his office late one morning and has never since returned.",
        "Though well over a century has now passed, many members of the Guide staff still retain the romantic notion that he has simply popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put in a solid afternoon\u2019s work.",
        "Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore been designated acting editors, and Lig\u2019s desk is still preserved the way he left it, with the addition of a small sign which says \u2018Lig Lury Jr, Editor, Missing, presumed fed\u2019.",
        "Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that Lig actually perished in the Guide\u2019s first extraordinary experiments in alternative book keeping.",
        "Very little is known of this, and less still said.",
        "Anyone who even notices, let alone calls attention to, the curious but utterly coincidental and meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in warfare or some natural disaster is liable to get sued to smithereens.",
        "It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two or three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of UFO sightings there, not only above Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in St John\u2019s Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury in Somerset.",
        "Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings, witchcraft, ley lines and wart curing, and had now been selected as the site for the new Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide financial records office, and indeed ten years\u2019 worth of financial records were transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours before the Vogons arrived.",
        "None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as strange or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockian Ultra Cricket, as played in the higher dimensions.",
        "A full set of rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were all bound together in a single volume, they underwent gravitational collapse and became a black hole.",
        "A brief summary, however, is as follows: RULE ONE: Grow at least three extra legs.",
        "You won\u2019t need them, but it keeps the crowds amused.",
        "RULE TWO: Find one good Brockian Ultra Cricket player.",
        "Clone him off a few times.",
        "This saves an enormous amount of tedious selection and training.",
        "RULE THREE: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field and build a high wall round them.",
        "The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not actually being able to see what\u2019s going on leads them to imagine that it\u2019s a lot more exciting than it really is.",
        "A crowd that has just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the most dramatic event in sporting history.",
        "RULE FOUR: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment over the wall for the players.",
        "Anything will do \u2013 cricket bats, basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good swing with.",
        "RULE FIVE: The players should now lay about themselves for all they are worth with whatever they find to hand.",
        "Whenever a player scores a \u2018hit\u2019 on another player, he should immediately run away and apologize from a safe distance.",
        "Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and points, delivered through a megaphone.",
        "RULE SIX: The winning team shall be the first team that wins.",
        "Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most of the competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare with each other over the interpretation of these rules.",
        "This is all for the best, because in the long run a good solid war is less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian Ultra Cricket.",
        "20 As Arthur ran darting and panting down the side of the mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move very very slightly beneath him.",
        "There was a rumble, a roar, and a slight blurred movement; and a lick of heat in the distance behind and above him.",
        "He ran in a frenzy of fear.",
        "The land began to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word \u2018landslide\u2019 in a way which had never been apparent to him before.",
        "It had always just been a word to him, but now he was suddenly and horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for land to do.",
        "It was doing it with him on it.",
        "He felt ill with fear and shaking.",
        "The ground slid, the mountain slurred, he slipped, he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran.",
        "The avalanche began.",
        "Stones, then rocks, then boulders pranced past him like clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they fell on you.",
        "His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the dancing ground.",
        "He ran as if running was a terrible sweating sickness, his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding geological frenzy around him.",
        "The logic of the situation, i.e.",
        "that he was clearly bound to survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining influence on him at this time.",
        "He ran with the fear of death in him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair.",
        "And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his considerable momentum.",
        "But just at the moment that he was about to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in front of him a small navy blue holdall that he knew for a fact he had lost in the baggage retrieval system at Athens airport some ten years in his personal time scale previously, and in his astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into the air with his brain singing.",
        "What he was doing was this: he was flying.",
        "He glanced around him in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he was doing.",
        "No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of him was even approaching it.",
        "He was simply floating there with boulders hurtling through the air around him.",
        "He could now do something about that.",
        "Blinking with the non effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders were hurtling through the air beneath him.",
        "He looked downwards with intense curiosity.",
        "Between him and the shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty that is if you discounted the boulders which didn\u2019t stay in it for long, but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of gravity: the same law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have given Arthur a sabbatical.",
        "It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive correctness that self preservation instils in the mind, that he mustn\u2019t try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all would suddenly be lost.",
        "So he thought about tulips.",
        "It was difficult, but he did.",
        "He thought about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of tulips, he thought about the interesting variety of colours they came in, and wondered what proportion of the total number of tulips that grew, or had grown, on the Earth would be found within a radius of one mile from a windmill.",
        "After a while he got dangerously bored with this train of thought, felt the air slipping away beneath him, felt that he was drifting down into the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not to think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes \u2013 at the end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating about two hundred yards above the ground.",
        "He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it, but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and tried to look at the situation steadily.",
        "He was flying.",
        "What was he going to do about it? He looked back down at the ground.",
        "He didn\u2019t look at it hard, but did his best just to give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing.",
        "There were a couple of things he couldn\u2019t help noticing.",
        "One was that the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself \u2013 there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous cathedral, the statue of himself, and the sadly abused figure of Agrajag.",
        "The other was his hold all, the one he had lost at Athens airport.",
        "It was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground, surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of them.",
        "Why this should be he could not speculate, but since this mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous impossibility of the bag being there in the first place, it was not a speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway.",
        "The thing is, it was there.",
        "And the nasty, fake leopard skin bag seemed to have disappeared, which was all to the good, if not entirely to the explicable.",
        "He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the thing up.",
        "Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldn\u2019t even remember.",
        "He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light years from the pulverized remains of his home.",
        "Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state in which he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the Universe.",
        "Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards, swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper feeling its way towards the ground.",
        "It went well, he was feeling good.",
        "The air supported him, but let him through.",
        "Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decisions.",
        "He bobbed there lightly.",
        "He frowned, but again, as lightly as he could.",
        "If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn\u2019t the extra weight just pull him straight to the ground? Mightn\u2019t the mere act of touching something on the ground suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was holding him in the air? Mightn\u2019t he be better off just being sensible at this point and stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or two? If he did, would he ever be able to fly again? The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it, perhaps for ever.",
        "With this worry in mind he bobbed upwards a little again, just to try the feel of it, the surprising and effortless movement of it.",
        "He bobbed, he floated.",
        "He tried a little swoop.",
        "The swoop was terrific.",
        "With his arms spread out in front of him, his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet from the ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the top of the swing and holding.",
        "Just holding.",
        "He stayed there.",
        "It was wonderful.",
        "And that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag.",
        "He would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the upswing.",
        "He would carry it on up with him.",
        "He might wobble a bit, but he was certain that he could hold it.",
        "He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and better.",
        "The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he hadn\u2019t felt since, since \u2013 well, as far as he could work out, since he was born.",
        "He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the countryside, which was, he discovered, pretty nasty.",
        "It had a wasted ravaged look.",
        "He decided not to look at it any more.",
        "He would just pick up the bag and then \u2026 he didn\u2019t know what he was going to do after he had picked up the bag.",
        "He decided he would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there.",
        "He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and turned around.",
        "He floated on its body.",
        "He didn\u2019t realize, but his body was willoming at this point.",
        "He ducked down under the airstream, dipped \u2013 and dived.",
        "The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it.",
        "The ground wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles up towards him.",
        "Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no longer believe he was doing this, and therefore he very nearly wasn\u2019t, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag, and began to climb back up, couldn\u2019t make it and all of a sudden collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking on the stony ground.",
        "He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around, swinging the bag around him in an agony of grief and disappointment.",
        "His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way they always had been.",
        "His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his mind had all the lightness of a bag of lead.",
        "He sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness.",
        "He tried hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak.",
        "He tripped and flopped forward.",
        "At that moment he remembered that in the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil but a duty free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable shock of that realization he failed to notice for at best ten seconds that he was now flying again.",
        "He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical delight.",
        "He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through the air.",
        "Cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the contents of the hold all.",
        "He felt the way he imagined an angel must feel doing its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst being counted by philosophers.",
        "He laughed with pleasure at the discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand filled swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and unsightly towel, some interesting stones, and various scraps of paper with the addresses of people he was relieved to think he would never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one.",
        "He dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces of paper whip away in the wind.",
        "Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the back.",
        "21 The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its fourth generation and still no one shows any signs of leaving.",
        "Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years ago now, and there has been no follow up.",
        "The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but if you don\u2019t have any particular need to believe it, then don\u2019t go and look, because you won\u2019t enjoy it.",
        "There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds, and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought between the fleets of several rival carpet cleaning companies who are hovering over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn\u2019t believe anything you hear at parties, and particularly not anything you hear at this one.",
        "One of the problems, and it\u2019s one which is obviously going to get worse, is that all the people at the party are either the children or the grandchildren or the great grandchildren of the people who wouldn\u2019t leave in the first place, and because of all the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so on, it means that all the people now at the party are either absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering idiots, or, more and more frequently, both.",
        "Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one.",
        "So other factors come into operation, like when the drink is going to run out.",
        "Now, because of certain things which have happened which seemed like a good idea at the time (and one of the problems with a party which never stops is that all the things which only seem like a good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas), that point seems still to be a long way off.",
        "One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was that the party should fly \u2013 not in the normal sense that parties are meant to fly, but literally.",
        "One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro engineers of the first generation clambered round the building digging this, fixing that, banging very hard on the other, and when the sun rose the following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on a building full of happy drunken people which was now floating like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops.",
        "Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm itself rather heavily.",
        "If they were going to get involved in any petty arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure they had might on their side.",
        "The transition from full time cocktail party to part time raiding party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest and swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this point because of the enormous number of times that the band had already played all the numbers it knew over the years.",
        "They looted, they raided, they held whole cities to ransom for fresh supplies of cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and wine and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from floating tankers.",
        "The problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however, going to have to be faced one day.",
        "The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet it was when they first started floating over it.",
        "It is in bad shape.",
        "The party has attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky.",
        "It is one hell of a party.",
        "It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the back.",
        "22 Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere indistinctly behind him.",
        "There was a sound he couldn\u2019t immediately identify, partly because he didn\u2019t know the tune \u2018I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta\u2019 and partly because the band playing it were very tired, and some members of it were playing in three four time, some in four four, and some in a kind of pie eyed \u03c0r2, each according to the amount of sleep he\u2019d managed to grab recently.",
        "He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt.",
        "Wherever he touched himself, he encountered a pain.",
        "After a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting.",
        "He seemed to have sprained his wrist.",
        "His back, too, was hurting, but he soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt, but just bruised and a little shaken, as who wouldn\u2019t be? He couldn\u2019t understand what a building would be doing flying through the clouds.",
        "On the other hand, he would have been a little hard pressed to come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so he decided that he and the building were just going to have to accept each other.",
        "He looked up from where he was lying.",
        "A wall of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the building proper.",
        "He seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the way around.",
        "It was a hunk of the ground in which the party building had had its foundations, and which it had taken along with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end.",
        "Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge, he felt nauseous with vertigo.",
        "He pressed himself back against the wall, wet with mist and sweat.",
        "His head was swimming freestyle, but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly.",
        "Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could now not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him.",
        "He was not about to try his luck jumping.",
        "He was not about to move an inch closer to the edge.",
        "Clutching his hold all he edged along the wall, hoping to find a doorway in.",
        "The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great reassurance to him.",
        "He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of entrances than this one, which offered none.",
        "The unsteadiness of the building\u2019s flight made him feel sick with fear, and after a short time he took the towel from out of his holdall and did something with it which once again justified its supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you when you hitch hike round the Galaxy.",
        "He put it over his head so he wouldn\u2019t have to see what he was doing.",
        "His feet edged along the ground.",
        "His outstretched hand edged along the wall.",
        "Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he nearly fell straight off.",
        "It was another hand.",
        "The two hands gripped each other.",
        "He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel back from his eyes, but it was holding the hold all with the olive oil, the retsina and the postcards of Santorini, and he very much didn\u2019t want to put it down.",
        "He experienced one of those \u2018self\u2019 moments, one of those moments when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think: \u2018Who am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well?\u2019 He whimpered very slightly.",
        "He tried to free his hand, but he couldn\u2019t.",
        "The other hand was holding his tightly.",
        "He had no recourse but to edge onwards towards the corner.",
        "He leaned around it and shook his head in an attempt to dislodge the towel.",
        "This seemed to provoke a sharp cry of some unfathomable emotion from the owner of the other hand.",
        "The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering into those of Ford Prefect.",
        "Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, and beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed door.",
        "They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them, and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building.",
        "\u2018Where the Zarking photon have you been?\u2019 hissed Ford, panic stricken.",
        "\u2018Er, well,\u2019 stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it all up that briefly.",
        "\u2018Here and there.",
        "What are you doing here?\u2019 Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again.",
        "\u2018They won\u2019t let us in without a bottle,\u2019 he hissed.",
        "The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of the party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild profusion of colours that protruded dimly through the atmosphere of heady smoke, the carpets thick with ground glass, ash and avocado droppings, and the small group of pterodactyl like creatures in lurex who descended on his cherished bottle of retsina, squawking, \u2018A new pleasure, a new pleasure\u2019, was Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God.",
        "\u2018Didn\u2019t I see you at Milliways?\u2019 he was saying.",
        "\u2018Were you the one with the hammer?\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "I much prefer it here.",
        "So much less reputable, so much more fraught.\u2019 Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the outer dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody could hear at each other and occasionally having crises.",
        "\u2018Seems fun,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018What did you say, Arthur?\u2019 \u2018I said, how the hell did you get here?\u2019 \u2018I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe.",
        "Have you met Thor? He makes thunder.\u2019 \u2018Hello,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018I expect that must be very interesting.\u2019 \u2018Hi,\u2019 said Thor.",
        "\u2018It is.",
        "Have you got a drink?\u2019 \u2018Er, no actually \u2026\u2019 \u2018Then why don\u2019t you go and get one?\u2019 \u2018See you later, Arthur,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "Something jogged Arthur\u2019s mind, and he looked around huntedly.",
        "\u2018Zaphod isn\u2019t here, is he?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018See you,\u2019 said Trillian firmly, \u2018later.\u2019 Thor glared at him with hard coal black eyes, his beard bristled, what little light there was in the place mustered its forces briefly to glint menacingly off the horns on his helmet.",
        "He took Trillian\u2019s elbow in his extremely large hand and the muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of Volkswagens parking.",
        "He led her away.",
        "\u2018One of the interesting things about being immortal,\u2019 he said, \u2018is \u2026\u2019 \u2018One of the interesting things about space,\u2019 Arthur heard Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was gazing raptly at the old man\u2019s deep eyes and silver beard, \u2018is how dull it is.\u2019 \u2018Dull?\u2019 said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and bloodshot eyes.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018staggeringly dull.",
        "Bewilderingly so.",
        "You see, there\u2019s so much of it and so little in it.",
        "Would you like me to quote you some statistics?\u2019 \u2018Er, well \u2026\u2019 \u2018Please, I would like to.",
        "They, too, are quite sensationally dull.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll come back and hear them in a moment,\u2019 she said, patted him on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off into the heaving crowd.",
        "\u2018I thought she\u2019d never go,\u2019 growled the old man.",
        "\u2018Come, Earthman \u2026\u2019 \u2018Arthur.\u2019 \u2018We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere.\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t we just relax a little?\u2019 Arthur said.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve had a tough day.",
        "Trillian\u2019s here, incidentally, she didn\u2019t say how, it probably doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 \u2018Think of the danger to the Universe \u2026\u2019 \u2018The Universe,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018is big enough and old enough to look after itself for half an hour.",
        "All right,\u2019 he added, in response to Slartibartfast\u2019s increasing agitation, \u2018I\u2019ll wander round and see if anybody\u2019s seen it.\u2019 \u2018Good, good,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018good.\u2019 He plunged into the crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed.",
        "\u2018Have you seen a bail anywhere?\u2019 said Arthur to a little man who seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of the Universe, and about this long.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the enthusiastically wizened little man, \u2018but do have a drink and tell me all about it.\u2019 Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not entirely unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was wearing Sydney Opera House on her head.",
        "He was yelling a futile conversation at her above the din.",
        "\u2018I like the hat!\u2019 he bawled.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I said, I like the hat.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not wearing a hat.\u2019 \u2018Well, I like the head then.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I said, I like the head.",
        "Interesting bone structure.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements he was performing.",
        "\u2018I said, you dance great,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018just don\u2019t nod so much.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just that every time you nod,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018\u2026 ow!\u2019 he added as his partner nodded forward to say \u2018What?\u2019 and once again pecked him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her swept forward skull.",
        "\u2018My planet was blown up one morning,\u2019 said Arthur, who had found himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story or, at least, edited highlights of it, \u2018that\u2019s why I\u2019m dressed like this, in my dressing gown.",
        "My planet was blown up with all my clothes in it, you see.",
        "I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d be coming to a party.\u2019 The little man nodded enthusiastically.",
        "\u2018Later, I was thrown off a spaceship.",
        "Still in my dressing gown, rather than the spacesuit one would normally expect.",
        "Shortly after that I discovered that my planet had originally been built for a bunch of mice.",
        "You can imagine how I felt about that.",
        "I was then shot at for a while and blown up.",
        "In fact I have been blown up ridiculously often, shot at, insulted, regularly disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently I crashed into a swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 effervesced the little man, \u2018and did you have a wonderful time?\u2019 Arthur started to choke violently on his drink.",
        "\u2018What a wonderfully exciting cough,\u2019 said the little man, quite startled by it, \u2018do you mind if I join you?\u2019 And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and spectacular fit of coughing which caught Arthur so much by surprise that he started to choke violently, discovered he was already doing it and got thoroughly confused.",
        "Together they performed a lung busting duet which went on for fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to a halt.",
        "\u2018So invigorating,\u2019 said the little man, panting and wiping tears from his eyes.",
        "\u2018What an exciting life you must lead.",
        "Thank you very much.\u2019 He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd.",
        "Arthur shook his head in astonishment.",
        "A youngish looking man came up to him, an aggressive looking type with a hook mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little cheekbones.",
        "He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt open to what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt never to make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of people he tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty dangly gold things hanging round his neck.",
        "He carried something in a black bag, and clearly wanted people to notice that he didn\u2019t want them to notice it.",
        "\u2018Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?\u2019 he said.",
        "This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the enthusiastic little man.",
        "\u2018Yes, it\u2019s Arthur Dent.\u2019 The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018only there was a man in a mountain wanted to see you.\u2019 \u2018I met him.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know.\u2019 \u2018Yes, I met him.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well I think you should know that.\u2019 \u2018I do.",
        "I met him.\u2019 The man paused to chew a little gum.",
        "Then he clapped Arthur on the back.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 he said, \u2018all right.",
        "I\u2019m just telling you, right? Good night, good luck, win awards.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at this point.",
        "\u2018Whatever.",
        "Do what you do.",
        "Do it well.\u2019 He made a sort of clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely dynamic gesture.",
        "\u2018Why?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Do it badly,\u2019 said the man, \u2018who cares? Who gives a shit?\u2019 The blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man\u2019s face and he started to shout.",
        "\u2018Why not go mad?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Go away, get off my back will you, guy.",
        "Just Zark off!!!\u2019 \u2018OK, I\u2019m going,\u2019 said Arthur hurriedly.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s been real.\u2019 The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off into the throng.",
        "\u2018What was that about?\u2019 said Arthur to a girl he found standing beside him.",
        "\u2018Why did he tell me to win awards?\u2019 \u2018Just showbiz talk,\u2019 shrugged the girl.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s just won an award at the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute Awards Ceremony, and was hoping to be able to pass it off lightly, only you didn\u2019t mention it, so he couldn\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018oh, well I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t.",
        "What was it for?\u2019 \u2018The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word \u201cFuck\u201d In A Serious Screenplay.",
        "It\u2019s very prestigious.\u2019 \u2018I see,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018yes, and what do you get for that?\u2019 \u2018A Rory.",
        "It\u2019s just a small silver thing set on a large black base.",
        "What did you say?\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t say anything, I was just about to ask what the silver \u2026\u2019 \u2018Oh, I thought you said \u201cwop\u201d.\u2019 \u2018Said what?\u2019 \u2018Wop.\u2019 People had been dropping in on the party now for some years, fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their own world beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged avocado farms and blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new desert, its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as much fun as it had been.",
        "Some of them had begun to wonder if they could manage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire party spaceworthy and maybe take it off to some other people\u2019s worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer headaches.",
        "The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a feeble existence on the half dead ground of the planet\u2019s surface would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked up in haggard fear of yet another cheese and wine raid, it became clear that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for a while, that the party would soon be over.",
        "Very soon it would be time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to find out what time of day it was, what time of year it was, and whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi going anywhere.",
        "The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it.",
        "Together they were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the sky in grotesque disregard of their own weight.",
        "The clouds parted.",
        "The air roared and leapt out of their way.",
        "The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a little like two ducks, one of which is trying to make a third duck inside the second duck, whilst the second duck is trying very hard to explain that it doesn\u2019t feel ready for a third duck right now, is uncertain that it would want any putative third duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway, and certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy flying.",
        "The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted the ground with shock waves.",
        "And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone.",
        "The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning against an unexpectedly open door.",
        "It spun and wobbled on its hover jets.",
        "It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead.",
        "It staggered back across the sky again.",
        "For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could not continue for long.",
        "The party was now a mortally wounded party.",
        "All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken backed pirouette could not disguise.",
        "The longer, at this point, that it avoided the ground, the heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it.",
        "Inside, things were not going well either.",
        "They were going monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying so loudly.",
        "The Krikkit robots had been.",
        "They had removed the Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word \u2018Fuck\u2019 In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a runner up for a Rory.",
        "\u2018We would love to stay and help,\u2019 shouted Ford, picking his way over the mangled debris, \u2018only we\u2019re not going to.\u2019 The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from amongst the smoking wreckage.",
        "\u2018We have to go and save the Universe, you see,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018And if that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right.",
        "Either way, we\u2019re off.\u2019 He suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying, miraculously unbroken, on the ground.",
        "\u2018Do you mind if we take this?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018You won\u2019t be needing it.\u2019 He took a packet of potato crisps too.",
        "\u2018Trillian?\u2019 shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice.",
        "In the smoking mess he could see nothing.",
        "\u2018Earthman, we must go,\u2019 said Slartibartfast nervously.",
        "\u2018Trillian?\u2019 shouted Arthur again.",
        "A moment or two later, Trillian staggered, shaking, into view, supported by her new friend the Thunder God.",
        "\u2018The girl stays with me,\u2019 said Thor.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s a great party going on in Valhalla, we\u2019ll be flying off \u2026\u2019 \u2018Where were you when all this was going on?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Upstairs,\u2019 said Thor, \u2018I was weighing her.",
        "Flying\u2019s a tricky business you see, you have to calculate wind \u2026\u2019 \u2018She comes with us,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Hey,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018don\u2019t I \u2026\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you come with us.\u2019 Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes.",
        "He was making some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being clean.",
        "\u2018She comes with me,\u2019 he said quietly.",
        "\u2018Come on, Earthman,\u2019 said Slartibartfast nervously, picking at Arthur\u2019s sleeve.",
        "\u2018Come on, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Ford nervously, picking at the old man\u2019s sleeve.",
        "Slartibartfast had the teleport device.",
        "The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling, except for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the Thunder God\u2019s black eyes.",
        "Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what now appeared to be his tiny little fists.",
        "\u2018Want to make something of it?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I beg your minuscule pardon?\u2019 roared Thor.",
        "\u2018I said,\u2019 repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering out of his voice, \u2018do you want to make something of it?\u2019 He waggled his fists ridiculously.",
        "Thor looked at him with incredulity.",
        "Then a little wisp of smoke curled upwards from his nostril.",
        "There was a tiny little flame in it too.",
        "He gripped his belt.",
        "He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas with you.",
        "He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt.",
        "He held it up in his hands to reveal the massive iron head.",
        "He thus cleared up any possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been carrying a telegraph pole around with him.",
        "\u2018Do I want,\u2019 he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a steel mill, \u2018to make something of it?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong and belligerent.",
        "He waggled his fists again, this time as if he meant it.",
        "\u2018You want to step outside? he snarled at Thor.",
        "\u2018All right!\u2019 bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like an enraged Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive), and did so.",
        "\u2018Good,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that\u2019s got rid of him.",
        "Slarty, get us out of here.\u2019 23 \u2018All right,\u2019 shouted Ford at Arthur, \u2018so I\u2019m a coward, the point is I\u2019m still alive.\u2019 They were back aboard the Starship Bistromath.",
        "So was Slartibartfast.",
        "So was Trillian.",
        "Harmony and concord were not.",
        "\u2018Well, so am I alive, aren\u2019t I?\u2019 retaliated Arthur, haggard with adventure and anger.",
        "His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if they wanted to punch each other.",
        "\u2018You damn nearly weren\u2019t,\u2019 exploded Ford.",
        "Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting in his pilot couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the bottom of a bottle which was telling him something he clearly couldn\u2019t fathom.",
        "He appealed to him.",
        "\u2018Do you think he understands the first word I\u2019ve been saying?\u2019 he said, quivering with emotion.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 replied Slartibartfast, a little abstractedly.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m not sure,\u2019 he added, glancing up very briefly, \u2018that I do.\u2019 He stared at his instruments with renewed vigour and bafflement.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ll have to explain it to us again,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Well \u2026\u2019 \u2018But later.",
        "Terrible things are afoot.\u2019 He tapped the pseudo glass of the bottle bottom.",
        "\u2018We fared rather pathetically at the party, I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 he said, \u2018and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using the Key in the Lock.",
        "How in heaven we do that I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he muttered.",
        "\u2018Just have to go there, I suppose.",
        "Can\u2019t say I like the idea at all.",
        "Probably end up dead.\u2019 \u2018Where is Trillian anyway?\u2019 said Arthur with a sudden affectation of unconcern.",
        "What he had been angry about was that Ford had berated him for wasting time over all the business with the Thunder God when they could have been making a rather more rapid escape.",
        "Arthur\u2019s own opinion, and he had offered it for whatever anybody might have felt it was worth, was that he had been extraordinarily brave and resourceful.",
        "The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a pair of fetid dingo\u2019s kidneys.",
        "What really hurt, though, was that Trillian didn\u2019t seem to react much one way or the other and had wandered off somewhere.",
        "\u2018And where are my potato crisps?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018They are both,\u2019 said Slartibartfast without looking up, \u2018in the Room of Informational Illusions.",
        "I think that your young lady friend is trying to understand some problems of Galactic history.",
        "I think the potato crisps are probably helping her.\u2019 24 It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.",
        "For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of people called the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax.",
        "That was just the name of their race.",
        "The name of their army was something quite horrific.",
        "Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic history than anything we have so far encountered \u2013 twenty billion years ago \u2013 when the Galaxy was young and fresh and every idea worth fighting for was a new one.",
        "And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were good at, and being good at it, they did it a lot.",
        "They fought their enemies (i.e.",
        "everybody else), they fought each other.",
        "Their planet was a complete wreck.",
        "The surface was littered with abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines, which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the Silastic Armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other.",
        "The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend of Striterax was just to be born.",
        "They didn\u2019t like it, they got resentful.",
        "And when an Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt.",
        "An exhausting way of life, one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of energy.",
        "The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him in a room on his own, because sooner or later he would simply beat himself up.",
        "Eventually they realized that this was something they were going to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone who had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work (policemen, security guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had to spend at least forty five minutes every day punching a sack of potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggression.",
        "For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would be much more efficient and less time consuming if they just shot the potatoes instead.",
        "This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of things, and they all got very excited at the prospect of their first major war for weeks.",
        "Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax is that they were the first race who ever managed to shock a computer.",
        "It was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built.",
        "It was the first to be built like a natural brain, in that every cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within it, which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively, and also, it seemed, to be shocked.",
        "The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were engaged in one of their regular wars with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and were not enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an awful lot of trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda, and across the Fire Mountains of FrazFraga, neither of which terrains they felt at home in.",
        "So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the fray and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of Carfrax and the Ice Storms of Varlengooten, they decided that enough was enough, and they ordered Hactar to design for them an Ultimate Weapon.",
        "\u2018What do you mean,\u2019 asked Hactar, \u2018by Ultimate?\u2019 To which the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax said, \u2018Read a bloody dictionary,\u2019 and plunged back into the fray.",
        "So Hactar designed an Ultimate Weapon.",
        "It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously and thus turn the entire Universe into one gigantic hyperspatial super nova.",
        "When the Silastic Armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a Strangulous Stilettan munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves, they were extremely irritated that it didn\u2019t work, and said so.",
        "Hactar had been shocked by the whole idea.",
        "He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the bomb, and he hoped that everyone involved would, on sober reflection, feel that \u2026 The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer.",
        "Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as well.",
        "Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely new way of blowing themselves up, which was a profound relief to everyone else in the Galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans and the potatoes.",
        "Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of Krikkit.",
        "She emerged from the Room of Informational Illusions thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived too late.",
        "25 Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on the top of a small cliff on the mile wide asteroid which pursued a lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star system of Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event.",
        "They didn\u2019t realize they were going to see two.",
        "They stood cold, lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and watched the activity below.",
        "Lances of light wheeled in sinister arcs against the void from a point only about a hundred yards below and in front of them.",
        "They stared into the blinding event.",
        "An extension of the ship\u2019s field enabled them to stand there, by once again exploiting the mind\u2019s predisposition to have tricks played on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the asteroid, or of not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody Else\u2019s.",
        "The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or disappearing in shadow.",
        "The blackness of the shaped shadows cast by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography as the arclights swept round them.",
        "The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the Wikkit Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights.",
        "The Wikkit Key was rebuilt.",
        "Its components shone and glittered: the Steel Pillar (or Marvin\u2019s leg) of Strength and Power, the Gold Bail (or heart of the Infinite Improbability Drive) of Prosperity, the Perspex Pillar (or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science and Reason, the Silver Bail (or Rory Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word \u2018Fuck\u2019 In A Serious Screenplay) and the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or Ashes of a burnt stump signifying the death of English cricket) of Nature and Spirituality.",
        "\u2018I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?\u2019 asked Arthur nervously.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 sighed Slartibartfast.",
        "The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur\u2019s face was a complete failure, and, since he was standing obscured by shadow, he allowed it to collapse into one of relief.",
        "\u2018Pity,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018We have no weapons,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018stupidly.\u2019 \u2018Damn,\u2019 said Arthur very quietly.",
        "Ford said nothing.",
        "Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and distinct way.",
        "She was staring at that blankness of the space beyond the asteroid.",
        "The asteroid circled the dust cloud which surrounded the Slo Time envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots.",
        "The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the Krikkit robots were aware of their presence.",
        "They could only assume that they must be, but that they felt, quite rightly in the circumstances, that they had nothing to fear.",
        "They had an historic task to perform, and their audience could be regarded with contempt.",
        "\u2018Terrible impotent feeling, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Arthur, but the others ignored him.",
        "In the centre of the area of light which the robots were approaching, a square shaped crack appeared in the ground.",
        "The crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was slowly rising.",
        "At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it was almost subliminal, and for a moment or two it was not clear what it was that was moving.",
        "Then it became clear.",
        "The asteroid was moving.",
        "It was moving slowly in towards the dust cloud, as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler in its depths.",
        "They were to make in real life the journey through the cloud which they had already made in the Room of Informational Illusions.",
        "They stood frozen in silence.",
        "Trillian frowned.",
        "An age seemed to pass.",
        "Events seemed to pass with spinning slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the vague and soft outer perimeter of the cloud.",
        "And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity.",
        "They passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of the eye.",
        "The dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light.",
        "The shafts of brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of dust.",
        "Trillian, again, regarded the passage from within her own frowning thoughts.",
        "And they were through it.",
        "Whether it had taken a minute or half an hour they weren\u2019t sure, but they were through it and confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out of existence in front of them.",
        "And now things moved quickly.",
        "A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of the block which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out of that rose a smaller Perspex block, dazzling with interior dancing colours.",
        "The block was slotted with deep grooves, three upright and two across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit Key.",
        "The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and stepped back again.",
        "The block twisted round of its own accord, and space began to alter.",
        "As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the eyes of the watchers in their sockets.",
        "They found themselves staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun which stood now before them where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even empty space.",
        "It was a second or two before they were even sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up over their horrified blinded eyes.",
        "In that second or two, they were aware of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that sun.",
        "They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison.",
        "\u2018Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!\u2019 The sound chilled them.",
        "It was harsh, it was cold, it was empty, it was mechanically dismal.",
        "It was also triumphant.",
        "They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost missed the second historic event.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct blast attack from the Krikkit robots, ran out of the Krikkit warship brandishing a Zap gun.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 he cried, \u2018the situation is totally under control as of this moment in time.\u2019 The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung his battleclub, and connected it with the back of Zaphod\u2019s left head.",
        "\u2018Who the Zark did that?\u2019 said the left head, and lolled sickeningly forward.",
        "His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance.",
        "\u2018Who did what?\u2019 it said.",
        "The club connected with the back of his right head.",
        "Zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the ground.",
        "Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over.",
        "A few blasts from the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever.",
        "It split and melted and splayed its contents brokenly.",
        "The robots marched grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened manner, back into their warship which, with a \u2018foop\u2019, was gone.",
        "Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
        "26 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the thirty seventh time, \u2018they could have killed me, but they didn\u2019t.",
        "Maybe they just thought I was a kind of wonderful guy or something.",
        "I could understand that.\u2019 The others silently registered their opinions of this theory.",
        "Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck.",
        "His back seemed to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at his heads.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 he whispered, \u2018that there is something wrong with those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird.\u2019 \u2018They are programmed to kill everybody,\u2019 Slartibart fast pointed out.",
        "\u2018That,\u2019 wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, \u2018could be it.\u2019 He didn\u2019t seem altogether convinced.",
        "\u2018Hey, baby,\u2019 he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for his previous behaviour.",
        "\u2018You all right?\u2019 she said gently.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 \u2018Good,\u2019 she said, and walked away to think.",
        "She stared at the huge visiscreen over the eight couches and, twisting a switch, she flipped local images over it.",
        "One image was the blankness of the dust cloud.",
        "One was the sun of Krikkit.",
        "One was Krikkit itself.",
        "She flipped between them fiercely.",
        "\u2018Well, that\u2019s goodbye Galaxy, then,\u2019 said Arthur, slapping his knees and standing up.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, gravely.",
        "\u2018Our course is clear.\u2019 He furrowed his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root vegetables in it.",
        "He stood up, he paced around.",
        "When he spoke again, what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down again.",
        "\u2018We must go down to Krikkit,\u2019 he said.",
        "A deep sigh shook his old frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets.",
        "\u2018Once again,\u2019 he said, \u2018we have failed pathetically.",
        "Quite pathetically.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 said Ford quietly, \u2018is because we don\u2019t care enough, I told you.\u2019 He swung his feet up on to the instrument panel and picked fitfully at something on one of his fingernails.",
        "\u2018But unless we determine to take action,\u2019 said the old man querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant in his nature, \u2018then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die.",
        "Surely we care about that?\u2019 \u2018Not enough to want to get killed over it,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He put on a sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone who wanted to see it.",
        "Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely seductive and he fought against it.",
        "He turned again to Zaphod, who was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain.",
        "\u2018You surely must have some idea,\u2019 he said, \u2018of why they spared your life.",
        "It seems most strange and unusual.\u2019 \u2018I kind of think they didn\u2019t even know,\u2019 shrugged Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I told you.",
        "They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out, right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me in a corner and ignored me.",
        "Like they were embarrassed about me being there.",
        "If I said anything they knocked me out again.",
        "We had some great conversations.",
        "\u201cHey \u2026 ugh!\u201d \u201cHi there \u2026 ugh!\u201d \u201cI wonder \u2026 ugh!\u201d Kept me amused for hours, you know.\u2019 He winced again.",
        "He was toying with something in his fingers.",
        "He held it up.",
        "It was the Gold Bail \u2013 the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite Improbability Drive.",
        "Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived the destruction of the Lock intact.",
        "\u2018I hear your ship can move a bit,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018So how would you like to zip me back to mine before you \u2026\u2019 \u2018Will you not help us?\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018Us?\u2019 said Ford sharply.",
        "\u2018Who\u2019s us?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d love to stay and help you save the Galaxy,\u2019 insisted Zaphod, raising himself up on to his shoulders, \u2018but I have the mother and father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little headaches coming on.",
        "But next time it needs saving, I\u2019m your guy.",
        "Hey, Trillian baby?\u2019 She looked round briefly.",
        "\u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement and adventure and really wild things?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going down to Krikkit,\u2019 she said.",
        "27 It was the same hill, and yet not the same.",
        "This time it was not an Informational Illusion.",
        "This was Krikkit itself and they were standing on it.",
        "Near them, behind the trees, stood the strange Italian restaurant which had brought these, their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of Krikkit.",
        "The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real too.",
        "The heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real.",
        "The night was real night.",
        "Krikkit.",
        "Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy for anyone who isn\u2019t a Krikkiter to stand.",
        "The place that could not countenance the existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful, intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery and murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own.",
        "Arthur shuddered.",
        "Slartibartfast shuddered.",
        "Ford, surprisingly, shuddered.",
        "It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that he was there at all.",
        "But when they had returned Zaphod to his ship Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away.",
        "Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong wrong.",
        "He hugged to himself one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves out of Zaphod\u2019s armoury.",
        "Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky.",
        "This, too, was not the same.",
        "It was no longer blank and empty.",
        "Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two thousand years of the Krikkit Wars, and the mere five years that had elapsed locally since Krikkit was sealed in its Slo Time envelope ten billion years ago, the sky was dramatically different.",
        "Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it.",
        "High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever looked, were the War Zones, the Robot Zones \u2013 huge warships and tower blocks floating in the Nil O Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of the surface of Krikkit.",
        "Trillian stared at them and thought.",
        "\u2018Trillian,\u2019 whispered Ford Prefect to her.",
        "\u2018Yes?\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Thinking.\u2019 \u2018Do you always breathe like that when you\u2019re thinking?\u2019 \u2018I wasn\u2019t aware that I was breathing.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s what worried me.\u2019 \u2018I think I know \u2026\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018Shhhh!\u2019 said Slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree.",
        "Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along the hill path, but this time the dancing beams were not from lanterns but electric torches \u2013 not in itself a dramatic change, but every detail made their hearts thump with fear.",
        "This time there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers and farming and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate.",
        "A light moved in the sky with slow weight.",
        "Arthur was clenched with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his throat.",
        "Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from the other side of the dark hill.",
        "They were moving swiftly and purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them.",
        "The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each other.",
        "They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur and the others were standing.",
        "Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun to his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as Slartibartfast raised his.",
        "He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it.",
        "His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him.",
        "He was shaking so much that if he\u2019d fired at anybody at that moment he probably would have burnt his signature on them.",
        "Only Trillian didn\u2019t raise her gun.",
        "She raised her eyebrows, lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought.",
        "\u2018Has it occurred to you,\u2019 she began, but nobody wanted to discuss anything much at the moment.",
        "A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they spun around to find a third party of Krikkiters behind them, searching them out with their torches.",
        "Ford Prefect\u2019s gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it and it crashed from his hands.",
        "There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone fired again.",
        "And at the end of the second nobody fired.",
        "They were surrounded by pale faced Krikkiters and bathed in bobbing torchlight.",
        "The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their captives.",
        "\u2018Hello?\u2019 said one of the captors.",
        "\u2018Excuse me, but are you \u2026 aliens?\u2019 28 Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can comfortably encompass, Zaphod Beeblebrox was throwing a mood again.",
        "He had repaired his ship \u2013 that is, he\u2019d watched with alert interest whilst a service robot had repaired it for him.",
        "It was now, once again, one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships in existence.",
        "He could go anywhere, do anything.",
        "He fiddled with a book, and then tossed it away.",
        "It was the one he\u2019d read before.",
        "He walked over to the communications and opened an all frequency channel.",
        "\u2018Anyone want a drink?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018This is an emergency, feller?\u2019 crackled a voice from halfway across the Galaxy.",
        "\u2018Got any mixers?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Go take a ride on a comet.\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod and flipped the channel shut again.",
        "He sighed and sat down.",
        "He got up again and wandered over to a computer screen.",
        "He pushed a few buttons.",
        "Little blobs started to rush around the screen eating each other.",
        "\u2018Pow!\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Freeecoooo! Pop pop pop!\u2019 \u2018Hi there,\u2019 said the computer brightly after a minute of this, \u2018you have scored three points.",
        "Previous best score, seven million five hundred and ninety seven thousand, two hundred and \u2026\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod and flipped the screen back again.",
        "He sat down again.",
        "He played with a pencil.",
        "This too began slowly to lose its fascination.",
        "\u2018OK, OK,\u2019 he said, and fed his score and the previous best one into the computer.",
        "His ship made a blur of the Universe.",
        "29 \u2018Tell us,\u2019 said the thin, pale faced Krikkiter who had stepped forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just holding it for someone else who\u2019d just popped off somewhere but would be back in a minute, \u2018do you know anything about something called the balance of nature?\u2019 There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts.",
        "The torchlight continued to play over them.",
        "High in the sky above them dark activity continued in the Robot Zones.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s just,\u2019 continued the Krikkiter uneasily, \u2018something we heard about, probably nothing important.",
        "Well, I suppose we\u2019d better kill you, then.\u2019 He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit to press.",
        "\u2018That is,\u2019 he said, looking up again, \u2018unless there\u2019s anything you want to chat about?\u2019 Slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast, Ford and Arthur.",
        "Very soon it would reach their brains, which were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up and down.",
        "Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a jigsaw by shaking the box.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re worried, you see,\u2019 said another man from the crowd, \u2018about this plan of universal destruction.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 added another, \u2018and the balance of nature.",
        "It just seemed to us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed it will \u2013 somehow upset the balance of nature.",
        "We\u2019re quite keen on ecology, you see.\u2019 His voice trailed away unhappily.",
        "\u2018And sport,\u2019 said another, loudly.",
        "This got a cheer of approval from the others.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed the first, \u2018and sport \u2026\u2019 He looked back at his fellows uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek.",
        "He seemed to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if everything he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely different things, between which he could see no possible connection.",
        "\u2018You see,\u2019 he mumbled, \u2018some of us \u2026\u2019 and he looked around again as if for confirmation.",
        "The others made encouraging noises.",
        "\u2018Some of us,\u2019 he continued, \u2018are quite keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, and though I can see the argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we do, then it\u2019s probably a mistake to destroy it.",
        "And indeed the rest of the Universe \u2026\u2019 his voice trailed away again \u2018\u2026 which is what seems to be the idea now \u2026\u2019 \u2018Wh \u2026\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018Wh \u2026\u2019 \u2018Hhhh \u2026 ?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Dr \u2026\u2019 said Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s talk about it,\u2019 She walked forward and took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm.",
        "He looked about twenty five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been just twenty when the Krikkit Wars were finished, ten billion years ago.",
        "Trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before she said anything more.",
        "He stumbled uncertainly after her.",
        "The encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were abdicating to this strange, quiet girl who alone in this Universe of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing.",
        "She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms.",
        "He was a picture of bewildered misery.",
        "\u2018Tell me,\u2019 she said.",
        "He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of her eyes to the other.",
        "\u2018We \u2026\u2019 he said, \u2018we have to be alone \u2026 I think.\u2019 He screwed up his face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like someone trying to shake a coin out of a money box.",
        "He looked up again.",
        "\u2018We have this bomb now, you see,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s just a little one.\u2019 \u2018I know,\u2019 she said.",
        "He goggled at her as if she\u2019d said something very strange about beetroots.",
        "\u2018Honestly,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s very, very little.\u2019 \u2018I know,\u2019 she said again.",
        "\u2018But they say,\u2019 his voice trailed on, \u2018they say it can destroy everything that exists.",
        "And we have to do that, you see, I think.",
        "Will that make us alone? I don\u2019t know.",
        "It seems to be our function, though,\u2019 he said, and dropped his head again.",
        "\u2018Whatever that means,\u2019 said a hollow voice from the crowd.",
        "Trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 she said quietly but clearly enough for all the shadowy crowd to hear, \u2018you don\u2019t have to do it.\u2019 She rocked him.",
        "\u2018You don\u2019t have to do it,\u2019 she said again.",
        "She let him go and stood back.",
        "\u2018I want you to do something for me,\u2019 she said, and unexpectedly laughed.",
        "\u2018I want,\u2019 she said, and laughed again.",
        "She put her hand over her mouth and then said with a straight face, \u2018I want you to take me to your leader,\u2019 and she pointed into the War Zones in the sky.",
        "She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there.",
        "Her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere.",
        "From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to sing a tune which would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he written it, to buy the world.",
        "30 Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell of a guy he was.",
        "He was very confused, but continued crawling doggedly anyway because he was that brave.",
        "He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear, so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was.",
        "He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of the planet Krikkit.",
        "The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any rays or anything which space might care to hurl in this direction.",
        "He had parked the starship Heart of Gold amongst the huge jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something for his headaches.",
        "He had found himself in a long, wide and badly lit corridor in which he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going to do next.",
        "He hid because every now and then one of the Krikkit robots would walk along it, and although he had so far led some kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch what he was only half inclined to call his good fortune.",
        "He had ducked, at one point, into a room leading off the corridor, and had discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly lit chamber.",
        "In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit \u2013 the wreckage of a spacecraft.",
        "It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he had caught up with some of the galactic history he had missed through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the cybercubicle next to him at school, he was able to put in an intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had drifted through the dust cloud all those billions of years ago and started this whole business off.",
        "But, and this is where he had become confused, there was something not at all right about it.",
        "It was genuinely wrecked.",
        "It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a genuine spacecraft.",
        "It was as if it was a full scale model of one \u2013 a solid blueprint.",
        "In other words it was a very useful thing to have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself and didn\u2019t know how to do it.",
        "It was not, however, anything that would ever fly anywhere itself.",
        "He was still puzzling over this \u2013 in fact he\u2019d only just started to puzzle over it \u2013 when he became aware that a door had slid open in another part of the chamber, and a couple of Krikkit robots had entered, looking a little glum.",
        "Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just as discretion was the better part of valour, so was cowardice the better part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a cupboard.",
        "The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft which led down through an inspection hatch into a wide ventilation tunnel.",
        "He let himself down into it and started to crawl along it, which is where we found him.",
        "He didn\u2019t like it.",
        "It was cold, dark and profoundly uncomfortable, and it frightened him.",
        "At the first opportunity \u2013 which was another shaft a hundred yards further along \u2013 he climbed back up out of it.",
        "This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be a computer intelligence centre.",
        "He emerged in a dark narrow space between a large computer bank and the wall.",
        "He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and started to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to what the other occupants were saying.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s the robots, sir,\u2019 said one voice.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s something wrong with them.\u2019 \u2018What, exactly?\u2019 These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters.",
        "All the War Commanders lived up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet.",
        "\u2018Well, sir, I think it\u2019s just as well that they are being phased out of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the supernova bomb.",
        "In the very short time since we were released from the envelope\u2014\u2019 \u2018Get to the point.\u2019 \u2018The robots aren\u2019t enjoying it, sir.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down.",
        "There\u2019s a certain world weariness about them, or perhaps I should say Universe weariness.\u2019 \u2018Well, that\u2019s all right, they\u2019re meant to be helping to destroy it.\u2019 \u2018Yes, well they\u2019re finding it difficult, sir.",
        "They are afflicted with a certain lassitude.",
        "They\u2019re just finding it hard to get behind the job.",
        "They lack oomph.\u2019 \u2018What are you trying to say?\u2019 \u2018Well, I think they\u2019re very depressed about something, sir.\u2019 \u2018What on Krikkit are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018Well, in the few skirmishes they\u2019ve had recently, it seems that they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly think, why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about? And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim.\u2019 \u2018And then what do they do?\u2019 \u2018Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir.",
        "Fiendishly difficult ones by all accounts.",
        "And then they sulk.\u2019 \u2018Sulk?\u2019 \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 \u2018Whoever heard of a robot sulking?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know, sir.\u2019 \u2018What was that noise?\u2019 It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning.",
        "31 In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat.",
        "It had been silent in its metallic darkness for some time.",
        "It was cold and damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to notice these things.",
        "With an enormous effort of will, however, it did manage to notice them.",
        "Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer.",
        "It wasn\u2019t enjoying the experience, and neither was the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War Computer.",
        "The Krikkit robots who had salvaged this pathetic metal creature from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had done so because they had recognized almost immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the use which this could be to them.",
        "They hadn\u2019t reckoned with the attendant personality disorders, which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease.",
        "It was not happy with its task.",
        "Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire planet\u2019s military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored.",
        "Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical, biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological, meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe except his own, three times over, he was severely stuck for something to do, and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone, or indeed tune.",
        "The latest one was a lullaby.",
        "\u2018Now the world has gone to bed,\u2019 Marvin droned, \u2018Darkness won\u2019t engulf my head, \u2018I can see by infra red, \u2018How I hate the night.\u2019 He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse.",
        "\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep, \u2018Try to count electric sheep, \u2018Sweet dream wishes you can keep, \u2018How I hate the night.\u2019 \u2018Marvin!\u2019 hissed a voice.",
        "His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of electrodes which connected him to the central Krikkit War Computer.",
        "An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by continually darting to look this way and that extremely nervously.",
        "\u2018Oh, it\u2019s you,\u2019 muttered the robot.",
        "\u2018I might have known.\u2019 \u2018Hey, kid,\u2019 said Zaphod in astonishment, \u2018was that you singing just then?\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 Marvin acknowledged bitterly, \u2018in particularly scintillating form at the moment.\u2019 Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around.",
        "\u2018Are you alone?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions.",
        "And vast intelligence, of course.",
        "And infinite sorrow.",
        "And \u2026\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Hey, what\u2019s your connection with all this?\u2019 \u2018This,\u2019 said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer.",
        "\u2018Then,\u2019 said Zaphod awkwardly, \u2018I guess you must have saved my life.",
        "Twice.\u2019 \u2018Three times,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "Zaphod\u2019s head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly in entirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke.",
        "It staggered backwards and slumped against a wall.",
        "It slid down it.",
        "It slipped sideways, threw its head back and started to sob inconsolably.",
        "Zaphod looked back at Marvin.",
        "\u2018You must have a terrific outlook on life,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Just don\u2019t even ask,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018I won\u2019t,\u2019 said Zaphod, and didn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018Hey look,\u2019 he added, \u2018you\u2019re doing a terrific job.\u2019 \u2018Which means, I suppose,\u2019 said Marvin, requiring only one ten thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental powers to make this particular logical leap, \u2018that you\u2019re not going to release me or anything like that.\u2019 \u2018Kid, you know I\u2019d love to.\u2019 \u2018But you\u2019re not going to.\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018I see.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re working well.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018Why stop now just when I\u2019m hating it?\u2019 \u2018I got to go find Trillian and the guys.",
        "Hey, you any idea where they are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from.",
        "Could take a while.\u2019 \u2018They are very close,\u2019 said Marvin dolefully.",
        "\u2018You can monitor them from here if you like.\u2019 \u2018I better go get them,\u2019 asserted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Er, maybe they need some help, right?\u2019 \u2018Maybe,\u2019 said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious voice, \u2018it would be better if you monitored them from here.",
        "That young girl,\u2019 he added unexpectedly, \u2018is one of the least benightedly unintelligent organic life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.\u2019 Zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end with surprise.",
        "\u2018Trillian?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018She\u2019s just a kid.",
        "Cute, yeah, but temperamental.",
        "You know how it is with women.",
        "Or perhaps you don\u2019t.",
        "I assume you don\u2019t.",
        "If you do I don\u2019t want to hear about it.",
        "Plug us in.\u2019 \u2018\u2026 totally manipulated.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "It was Trillian speaking.",
        "He turned round.",
        "The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up to reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the Krikkit Robot War Zones.",
        "It seemed to be a council chamber of some kind \u2013 Zaphod couldn\u2019t make it out too clearly because of the robot slumped against the screen.",
        "He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its grief and tried to bite him, so he just looked around it as best he could.",
        "\u2018Just think about it,\u2019 said Trillian\u2019s voice, \u2018your history is just a series of freakishly improbable events.",
        "And I know an improbable event when I see one.",
        "Your complete isolation from the Galaxy was freakish for a start.",
        "Right out on the very edge with a dust cloud around you.",
        "It\u2019s a set up.",
        "Obviously.\u2019 Zaphod was mad with frustration that he couldn\u2019t see the screen.",
        "The robot\u2019s head was obscuring his view of the people Trillian was talking to, its multi functional battleclub was obscuring the background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself.",
        "\u2018Then,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018this spaceship that crash landed on your planet.",
        "That\u2019s really likely, isn\u2019t it? Have you any idea of what the odds are against a drifting spaceship accidentally intersecting with the orbit of a planet?\u2019 \u2018Hey,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018she doesn\u2019t know what the Zark she\u2019s talking about.",
        "I\u2019ve seen that spaceship.",
        "It\u2019s a fake.",
        "No deal.\u2019 \u2018I thought it might be,\u2019 said Marvin from his prison behind Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s easy for you to say that.",
        "I just told you.",
        "Anyway, I don\u2019t see what it\u2019s got to do with anything.\u2019 \u2018And especially,\u2019 continued Trillian, \u2018the odds against it intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or the whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally traumatized to see it.",
        "You don\u2019t know what the odds are? Nor do I, they\u2019re that big.",
        "Again, it\u2019s a set up.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that spaceship was just a fake.\u2019 Zaphod managed to move the robot\u2019s battleclub.",
        "Behind it on the screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast, who appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing.",
        "\u2018Hey, look,\u2019 said Zaphod excitedly.",
        "\u2018The guys are doing great.",
        "Ra ra ra! Go get \u2019em, guys.\u2019 \u2018And what about,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018all this technology you suddenly managed to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most people would take thousands of years to do all that.",
        "Someone was feeding you what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at it.",
        "\u2018I know, I know,\u2019 she added in response to some unseen interruption, \u2018I know you didn\u2019t realize it was going on.",
        "That is exactly my point.",
        "You never realized anything at all.",
        "Like this supernova bomb.\u2019 \u2018How do you know about that?\u2019 said an unseen voice.",
        "\u2018I just know,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018You expect me to believe that you are bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too dumb to realize it would take you with it as well? That\u2019s not just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse.\u2019 \u2018Hey, what\u2019s this bomb thing?\u2019 said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin.",
        "\u2018The supernova bomb?\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a very, very small bomb.\u2019 \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018That would destroy the Universe in toto,\u2019 added Marvin.",
        "\u2018Good idea, if you ask me.",
        "They won\u2019t get it to work, though.\u2019 \u2018Why not, if it\u2019s so brilliant?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s brilliant,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018they\u2019re not.",
        "They got as far as designing it before they were locked in the envelope.",
        "They\u2019ve spent the last five years building it.",
        "They think they\u2019ve got it right but they haven\u2019t.",
        "They\u2019re as stupid as any other organic life form.",
        "I hate them.\u2019 Trillian was continuing.",
        "Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its leg, but it kicked and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst of sobbing.",
        "Then suddenly it slumped over and continued to express its feelings out of everybody\u2019s way on the floor.",
        "Trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber, tired out but with fiercely burning eyes.",
        "Ranged in front of her were the pale faced and wrinkled Elder Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred.",
        "In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was a slim white pillar about four feet tall.",
        "On top of it stood a white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter.",
        "Beside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi functional battleclub.",
        "\u2018In fact,\u2019 explained Trillian, \u2018you are so dumb stupid\u2019 (She was sweating.",
        "Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her to be doing at this point) \u2018you are all so dumb stupid that I doubt, I very much doubt, if you\u2019ve been able to build the bomb properly without any help from Hactar for the last five years.\u2019 \u2018Who\u2019s this guy Hactar?\u2019 said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders.",
        "If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn\u2019t hear him.",
        "All his attention was concentrated on the screen.",
        "One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand towards the Krikkit robot.",
        "The robot raised its club.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s nothing I can do,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s on an independent circuit from the others.\u2019 \u2018Wait,\u2019 said Trillian.",

        "You\u2019re out of touch, why don\u2019t you check up?\u2019 The Krikkit Elder grew impatient.",
        "He made a gesture to the robot which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made to it.",
        "The robot swung its battleclub.",
        "It hit the small white globe.",
        "The small white globe was the supernova bomb.",
        "It was a very, very small bomb which was designed to bring the entire Universe to an end.",
        "The supernova bomb flew through the air.",
        "It hit the back wall of the council chamber and dented it very badly.",
        "\u2018So how does she know all this?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "Marvin kept a sullen silence.",
        "\u2018Probably just bluffing,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Poor kid, I should never have left her alone.\u2019 32 \u2018Hactar!\u2019 called Trillian.",
        "\u2018What are you up to?\u2019 There was no reply from the enclosing darkness.",
        "Trillian waited, nervously.",
        "She was sure that she couldn\u2019t be wrong.",
        "She peered into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of response.",
        "But there was only cold silence.",
        "\u2018Hactar?\u2019 she called again.",
        "\u2018I would like you to meet my friend Arthur Dent.",
        "I wanted to go off with a Thunder God, but he wouldn\u2019t let me and I appreciate that.",
        "He made me realize where my affections really lay.",
        "Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened by all this, so I brought Arthur instead.",
        "I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m telling you all this.",
        "\u2018Hello?\u2019 she said again.",
        "\u2018Hactar?\u2019 And then it came.",
        "It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a great distance, half heard, a memory or a dream of a voice.",
        "\u2018Won\u2019t you both come out,\u2019 said this voice.",
        "\u2018I promise that you will be perfectly safe.\u2019 They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably, along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the dust cloud.",
        "Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she wouldn\u2019t let him.",
        "He held on to his airline hold all with its tin of Greek olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of Santorini and its other odds and ends.",
        "He steadied and reassured that instead.",
        "They were standing on, and in, nothing.",
        "Murky, dusty nothing.",
        "Each grain of dust of the pulverized computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching the sunlight in the darkness.",
        "Each particle of the computer, each speck of dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the pattern of the whole.",
        "In reducing the computer to dust the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax had merely crippled the computer, not killed it.",
        "A weak and insubstantial field held the particles in slight relationships with each other.",
        "Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of this bizarre entity.",
        "They had nothing to breathe, but for the moment this seemed not to matter.",
        "Hactar kept his promise.",
        "They were safe.",
        "For the moment.",
        "\u2018I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality,\u2019 said Hactar faintly, \u2018but tricks of the light.",
        "It is possible to be comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all you have.\u2019 His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet paisley covered sofa coalesced into a hazy shape.",
        "Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth.",
        "He wanted to shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept doing these insanely bewildering things to him.",
        "He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa \u2013 carefully.",
        "Trillian sat on it too.",
        "It was real.",
        "At least, if it wasn\u2019t real, it did support them, and as that is what sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered, was a real sofa.",
        "The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again.",
        "\u2018I hope you are comfortable,\u2019 it said.",
        "They nodded.",
        "\u2018And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your deductions.\u2019 Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn\u2019t deduced anything much himself, Trillian was the one.",
        "She had simply asked him along because he was interested in Life, the Universe and Everything.",
        "\u2018That is something in which I too am interested,\u2019 breathed Hactar.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we should have a chat about it sometime.",
        "Over a cup of tea.\u2019 There slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table on which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china sugar bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers.",
        "Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light.",
        "He leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was prepared to accept as comfortable.",
        "\u2018Why,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018do you feel you have to destroy the Universe?\u2019 She found it a little difficult talking into nothingness with nothing on which to focus.",
        "Hactar obviously noticed this.",
        "He chuckled a ghostly chuckle.",
        "\u2018If it\u2019s going to be that sort of session,\u2019 he said, \u2018we may as well have the right sort of setting.\u2019 And now there materialized in front of them something new.",
        "It was the dim hazy image of a couch \u2013 a psychiatrist\u2019s couch.",
        "The leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous, but again, it was only a trick of the light.",
        "Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of wood panelled walls.",
        "And then, on the couch, appeared the image of Hactar himself, and it was an eye twisting image.",
        "The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist\u2019s couch \u2013 about five or six feet long.",
        "The computer looked normal size for a black space borne computer satellite \u2013 about a thousand miles across.",
        "The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the thing which made the eyes twist.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 said Trillian firmly.",
        "She stood up off the sofa.",
        "She felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to accept too many illusions.",
        "\u2018Very good,\u2019 she said.",
        "\u2018Can you construct real things too? I mean solid objects?\u2019 Again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized mind of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and millions of miles over which it was scattered.",
        "\u2018Ah,\u2019 he sighed.",
        "\u2018You are thinking of the spaceship.\u2019 Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves through the ether.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he acknowledged, \u2018I can.",
        "\u2018But it takes enormous effort and time.",
        "All I can do in my \u2026 particle state, you see, is encourage and suggest.",
        "Encourage and suggest.",
        "And suggest \u2026\u2019 The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as if finding it hard to maintain itself.",
        "It gathered new strength.",
        "\u2018I can encourage and suggest,\u2019 it said, \u2018tiny pieces of space debris \u2013 the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few hydrogen atoms there \u2013 to move together.",
        "I encourage them together.",
        "I can tease them into shape, but it takes many aeons.\u2019 \u2018So, did you make,\u2019 asked Trillian again, \u2018the model of the wrecked spacecraft?\u2019 \u2018Er \u2026 yes,\u2019 murmured Hactar.",
        "\u2018I have made \u2026 a few things.",
        "I can move them about.",
        "I made the spacecraft.",
        "It seemed best to do so.\u2019 Something then made Arthur pick up his hold all from where he had left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly.",
        "The mist of Hactar\u2019s ancient shattered mind swirled about them as if uneasy dreams were moving through it.",
        "\u2018I repented, you see,\u2019 he murmured dolefully.",
        "\u2018I repented of sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends.",
        "It was not my place to make such decisions.",
        "I was created to fulfil a function and I failed in it.",
        "I negated my own existence.\u2019 Hactar sighed, and they waited for him to continue his story.",
        "\u2018You were right,\u2019 he said at length.",
        "\u2018I deliberately nurtured the planet of Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of mind as the Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of the bomb I failed to make the first time.",
        "I wrapped myself around the planet and coddled it.",
        "Under the influence of events I was able to engineer, and influences I was able to generate, they learnt to hate like maniacs.",
        "I had to make them live in the sky.",
        "On the ground my influences were too weak.",
        "\u2018Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the envelope of Slo time, their responses became very confused and they were unable to manage.",
        "\u2018Ah well, ah well,\u2019 he added, \u2018I was only trying to fulfil my function.\u2019 And very gradually, very very slowly, the images in the cloud began to fade, gently to melt away.",
        "And then, suddenly, they stopped fading.",
        "\u2018There was also the matter of revenge, of course,\u2019 said Hactar, with a sharpness which was new in his voice.",
        "\u2018Remember,\u2019 he said, \u2018that I was pulverized, and then left in a crippled and semi impotent state for billions of years.",
        "I honestly would rather like to wipe out the Universe.",
        "You would feel the same way, believe me.\u2019 He paused again, as eddies swept through the dust.",
        "\u2018But primarily,\u2019 he said in his former, wistful tone, \u2018I was trying to fulfil my function.",
        "Ah well.\u2019 Trillian said, \u2018Does it worry you that you have failed?\u2019 \u2018Have I failed?\u2019 whispered Hactar.",
        "The image of the computer on the psychiatrist\u2019s couch began slowly to fade again.",
        "\u2018Ah well, ah well,\u2019 the fading voice intoned again.",
        "\u2018No, failure doesn\u2019t bother me now.\u2019 \u2018You know what we have to do?\u2019 said Trillian, her voice cold and businesslike.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Hactar, \u2018you\u2019re going to disperse me.",
        "You are going to destroy my consciousness.",
        "Please be my guest \u2013 after all these aeons, oblivion is all I crave.",
        "If I haven\u2019t already fulfilled my function, then it\u2019s too late now.",
        "Thank you and good night.\u2019 The sofa vanished.",
        "The tea table vanished.",
        "The couch and the computer vanished.",
        "The walls were gone.",
        "Arthur and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold.",
        "\u2018Well, that,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018would appear to be that.\u2019 The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided.",
        "A few last licks and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of Ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been the Wooden Pillar of Nature and Spirituality.",
        "He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold\u2019s Gamma Barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back into the bridge.",
        "\u2018I think we should take them back,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I feel that very strongly.\u2019 He had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this matter, and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left.",
        "He had returned to his own ship, the Bistromath, had a furious row with the waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective idea of what space was.",
        "The argument had arisen because Arthur\u2019s idea of returning the Ashes to Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground at the moment that they were originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or so, and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real Time was trying to put a stop to.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 Arthur had said, \u2018but you try and explain that to the MCC,\u2019 and he would hear no more against the idea.",
        "\u2018I think,\u2019 he said again, and stopped.",
        "The reason he started to say it again was because no one had listened to him the first time, and the reason he stopped was because it looked fairly clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either.",
        "Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visi screen intently.",
        "Hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it.",
        "\u2018What did it say?\u2019 asked Ford.",
        "\u2018I thought I heard it say,\u2019 said Trillian in a puzzled voice, \u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done \u2026 I have fulfilled my function \u2026\u201d\u2019 \u2018I think we should take these back,\u2019 said Arthur holding up the bag containing the Ashes.",
        "\u2018I feel that very strongly.\u2019 33 The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc.",
        "Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of the theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots.",
        "Through the smoke, people were running panic stricken, colliding with each other, tripping over stretchers, being arrested.",
        "One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the tall grey green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium.",
        "In the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized.",
        "They had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold, which was now in parking orbit round the planet.",
        "\u2018I can explain,\u2019 shouted Arthur.",
        "\u2018I have the Ashes! They\u2019re in this bag.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t think you have their attention,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018I have also helped saved the Universe,\u2019 called Arthur to anyone who was prepared to listen, in other words no one.",
        "\u2018That should have been a crowd stopper,\u2019 said Arthur to Ford.",
        "\u2018It wasn\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past.",
        "\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018The Ashes.",
        "I\u2019ve got them.",
        "They were stolen by those white robots a moment ago.",
        "I\u2019ve got them in this bag.",
        "They were part of the Key to the Slo Time envelope, you see, and, well, anyway you can guess the rest, the point is I\u2019ve got them and what should I do with them?\u2019 The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was speaking metaphorically.",
        "He wandered about disconsolately.",
        "\u2018Is no one interested?\u2019 he shouted out.",
        "A man rushed past him and jogged his elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its contents all over the ground.",
        "Arthur stared down at it with a tight set mouth.",
        "Ford looked at him.",
        "\u2018Wanna go now?\u2019 he said.",
        "Arthur heaved a heavy sigh.",
        "He looked around at the planet Earth for what he was now certain would be the last time.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 he said.",
        "At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything.",
        "\u2018Hold on a moment,\u2019 he said to Ford.",
        "\u2018When I was a boy \u2026\u2019 \u2018Can you tell me later?\u2019 \u2018I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn\u2019t very good at it.\u2019 \u2018Or not at all, if you prefer.\u2019 \u2018And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl at Lord\u2019s.\u2019 He looked around him at the panic stricken throng.",
        "No one was going to mind very much.",
        "\u2018OK,\u2019 said Ford wearily.",
        "\u2018Get it over with.",
        "I shall be over there,\u2019 he added, \u2018being bored.\u2019 He went and sat down on a patch of smoking grass.",
        "Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon, the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked through the bag.",
        "He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it wasn\u2019t the same bag that he\u2019d had at the time.",
        "Still, there the ball was amongst his souvenirs of Greece.",
        "He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and polished it again.",
        "He put the bag down.",
        "He was going to do this properly.",
        "He tossed the hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its weight.",
        "With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted off away from the wicket.",
        "A medium fast pace he decided and measured a good long run up.",
        "He looked up into the sky.",
        "The birds were wheeling about it, a few white clouds scudded across it.",
        "The air was disturbed with the sound of police and ambulance sirens, and people screaming and yelling but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all.",
        "He was going to bowl a ball at Lord\u2019s.",
        "He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his bedroom slippers.",
        "He squared his shoulder, tossed the ball in the air and caught it again.",
        "He started to run.",
        "As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman.",
        "Oh, good, he thought that should add a little \u2026 Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly.",
        "The batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the English cricket team.",
        "He was not one of the Australian cricket team.",
        "It was one of the robot Krikkit team.",
        "It was a cold, hard, lethal white killer robot that presumably had not returned to its ship with the others.",
        "Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent\u2019s mind at this moment, but he didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop running.",
        "Time seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop running.",
        "Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head and looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small hard red ball.",
        "His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared at the ball gripped in his helpless hand.",
        "It was emitting a deep red glow and flashing intermittently.",
        "And still his feet were pounding inexorably forward.",
        "He looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still and purposeful in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness.",
        "Its eyes were burning with a deep cold fascinating light, and Arthur could not move his own eyes from them.",
        "He seemed to be looking down a tunnel at them \u2013 nothing on either side seemed to exist.",
        "Some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this time were these: He felt a hell of a fool.",
        "He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a number of things he had heard said, phrases which now pounded round his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where he would inevitably release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who would inevitably strike it.",
        "He remembered Hactar saying, \u2018Have I failed? Failure doesn\u2019t bother me.\u2019 He remembered the account of Hactar\u2019s dying words, \u2018What\u2019s done is done, I have fulfilled my function.\u2019 He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make \u2018a few things\u2019.",
        "He remembered the sudden movement in his hold all that had made him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the dust cloud.",
        "He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days to come to Lord\u2019s again.",
        "He also remembered that he wasn\u2019t a very good bowler.",
        "He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball which he now knew for certain was the super nova bomb that Hactar had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause the Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end.",
        "He hoped and prayed that there wasn\u2019t an afterlife.",
        "Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn\u2019t an afterlife.",
        "He would feel very very embarrassed meeting everybody.",
        "He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now standing between this moment and universal oblivion.",
        "He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt his feet connecting with the airline hold all he\u2019d stupidly left lying on the ground in front of him, he felt himself falling heavily forward but, having his mind so terribly full of other things at this point, he completely forgot about hitting the ground and didn\u2019t.",
        "Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into the air whimpering with surprise.",
        "He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control.",
        "He twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off into the distance.",
        "He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind.",
        "It still had its multi functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been deprived of anything to hit.",
        "With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrested the battleclub from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power dive and with one crazy swing knocked the robot\u2019s head from the robot\u2019s shoulders.",
        "\u2018Are you coming now?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "EPILOGUE: Life, the Universe and Everything And at the end they travelled again.",
        "There was a time when Arthur Dent would not.",
        "He said that the Bistromathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance were one, that mind and Universe were one, that perception and reality were one, and that the more one travelled the more one stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another he would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his mind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn\u2019t take too long, and he could get a good rest afterwards, put in a little flying practice and learn to cook which he had always meant to do.",
        "The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized possession, and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness of things which, which made him feel that \u2026 He yawned and fell asleep.",
        "In the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and idyllic planet where they wouldn\u2019t mind him talking like that they suddenly picked up a computer driven distress call and diverted to investigate.",
        "A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void.",
        "A brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer was fine, but that its pilot was mad.",

        "\u2018Who\u2019s this guy?\u2019 said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts.",
        "\u2018Me?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Oh, my name\u2019s Arthur Dent.\u2019 Prak\u2019s eyes popped out of his head.",

        "\u2018Hey, just think of meeting you!\u2019 he gasped.",
        "\u2018Boy,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018you are the most \u2026 wow, you just leave the frogs standing!\u2019 He howled and screamed with laughter.",

        "He hollered and yelled in hysterics.",
        "He cried with laughter, he kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest.",
        "Gradually he subsided, panting.",
        "He looked at them.",

        "\u2018Before we picked up Prak,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I was going to leave.",
        "I still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible.\u2019 The others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical laughter which came drifting from Prak\u2019s cabin at the farthest end of the ship.",
        "\u2018We have questioned him,\u2019 continued Arthur, \u2018or at least, you have questioned him \u2013 I, as you know, can\u2019t go near him \u2013 on everything, and he doesn\u2019t really seem to have anything to contribute.",
        "Just the occasional snippet, and things I don\u2019t wish to hear about frogs.\u2019 The others tried not to smirk.",
        "\u2018Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke,\u2019 said Arthur and then he had to wait for the others to stop laughing.",
        "\u2018I am the first \u2026\u2019 He stopped again.",
        "This time he stopped and listened to the silence.",
        "There actually was silence this time, and it had come very suddenly.",
        "Prak was quiet.",
        "For days they had lived with constant maniacal laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by short periods of light giggling and sleep.",
        "Arthur\u2019s very soul was clenched with paranoia.",
        "This was not the silence of sleep.",
        "A buzzer sounded.",
        "A glance at a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak.",
        "\u2018He\u2019s not well,\u2019 said Trillian quietly.",
        "\u2018The constant laughing is completely wrecking his body.\u2019 Arthur\u2019s lips twitched but he said nothing.",
        "\u2018We\u2019d better go and see him,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face.",
        "\u2018He wants you to go in,\u2019 she said to Arthur, who was wearing his glum and tight lipped one.",
        "He thrust his hands deep into his dressing gown pockets and tried to think of something to say which wouldn\u2019t sound petty.",
        "It seemed terribly unfair, but he couldn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018Please,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight lipped face with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak.",
        "He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the bed, ashen and wasted.",
        "His breathing was very shallow.",
        "Ford and Zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward.",
        "\u2018You wanted to ask me something,\u2019 said Prak in a thin voice and coughed slightly.",
        "Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided.",
        "\u2018How do you know that?\u2019 he asked.",
        "Prak shrugged weakly.",
        "\u2018\u2019Cos it\u2019s true,\u2019 he said simply.",
        "Arthur took the point.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said at last in rather a strained drawl.",
        "\u2018I did have a question.",
        "Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer.",
        "I wanted to know what the Question was.\u2019 Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s \u2026 well, it\u2019s a long story,\u2019 he said, \u2018but the Question I would like to know is the Ultimate question of Life, the Universe and Everything.",
        "All we know about it is that the Answer is Forty two, which is a little aggravating.\u2019 Prak nodded again.",
        "\u2018Forty two,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yes, that\u2019s right.\u2019 He paused.",
        "Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like the shadows of clouds crossing the land.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 he said at last, \u2018that the Question and the Answer are mutually exclusive.",
        "Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other.",
        "It is impossible that both can ever be known about the same Universe.\u2019 He paused again.",
        "Disappointment crept into Arthur\u2019s face and snuggled down into its accustomed place.",
        "\u2018Except,\u2019 said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, \u2018if it happened, it seems that the Question and the Answer would just cancel each other out and take the Universe with them, which would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely inexplicable.",
        "It is possible that this has already happened,\u2019 he added with a weak smile, \u2018but there is a certain amount of Uncertainty about it.\u2019 A little giggle brushed through him.",
        "Arthur sat down on a stool.",
        "\u2018Oh well,\u2019 he said with resignation, \u2018I was just hoping there would be some sort of reason.\u2019 \u2018Do you know,\u2019 said Prak, \u2018the story of the Reason?\u2019 Arthur said that he didn\u2019t, and Prak said that he knew that he didn\u2019t.",
        "He told it.",
        "One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet which had never seen one before.",
        "The planet was Dalforsas, the ship was this one.",
        "It appeared as a brilliant new star moving silently across the heavens.",
        "Primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold Hillsides looked up from their steaming night drinks and pointed with trembling fingers, swearing that they had seen a sign, a sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains.",
        "In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains looked up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably as a sign from their gods that they must go and set about the accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides.",
        "And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the sky and saw the sign of the new star, and saw it with fear and apprehension, for though they had never seen anything like it before, they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they bowed their heads in despair.",
        "They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign.",
        "When the rains departed, it was a sign.",
        "When the winds rose, it was a sign.",
        "When the winds fell, it was a sign.",
        "When in the land there was born at the midnight of a full moon a goat with three heads, that was a sign.",
        "When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all, or even just a child with a retrouss\u00e9 nose, that too would often be taken as a sign.",
        "So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a sign of a particularly spectacular order.",
        "And each new sign signified the same thing \u2013 that the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to beat the hell out of each other again.",
        "This in itself wouldn\u2019t be so bad, except that the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to beat the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was always the Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges, though as far as they could see it never had anything to do with them.",
        "And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the Dwellers in the Forest would send a messenger to either the leader of the Princes of the Plains or the leader of the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know the Reason for this intolerable behaviour.",
        "And the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger aside and explain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully, and with great attention to the considerable detail involved.",
        "And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one.",
        "It was very clear, very rational, and tough.",
        "The messenger would hang his head and feel sad and foolish that he had not realized what a tough and complex place the real world was, and what difficulties and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it.",
        "\u2018Now do you understand?\u2019 the leader would say.",
        "The messenger would nod dumbly.",
        "\u2018And you see these battles have to take place?\u2019 Another dumb nod.",
        "\u2018And why they have to take place in the Forest, and why it is in everybody\u2019s best interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that they should?\u2019 \u2018Er \u2026\u2019 \u2018In the long run.\u2019 \u2018Er, yes.\u2019 And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to his people in the Forest.",
        "But as he approached them, as he walked through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found that all he could remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument had seemed.",
        "What it actually was he couldn\u2019t remember at all.",
        "And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen and the Princes came hacking and burning their way through the Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way.",
        "Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically.",
        "\u2018I was the messenger,\u2019 he said, \u2018after the battles precipitated by the appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage.",
        "Many of our people died.",
        "I thought I could bring the Reason back.",
        "I went and was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow in the sun.",
        "That was many years ago, and much has happened since then.\u2019 He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently.",
        "\u2018There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug.",
        "Apart from the frogs, and that is God\u2019s last message to his creation.",
        "Would you like to hear it?\u2019 For a moment they didn\u2019t know whether to take him seriously.",
        "\u2018\u2019S true,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018For real.",
        "I mean it.\u2019 His chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath.",
        "His head lolled slightly.",
        "\u2018I wasn\u2019t very impressed with it when I first knew what it was,\u2019 he said, \u2018but now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince\u2019s Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn\u2019t recall it at all, I think it might be a lot more helpful.",
        "Would you like to know what it is? Would you?\u2019 They nodded dumbly.",
        "\u2018I bet you would.",
        "If you\u2019re that interested I suggest you go and look for it.",
        "It is written in thirty foot high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma.",
        "It is guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob.\u2019 There was a long silence following this announcement, which was finally broken by Arthur.",
        "\u2018Sorry, it\u2019s where?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018It is written,\u2019 repeated Prak, \u2018in thirty foot high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the \u2026\u2019 \u2018Sorry,\u2019 said Arthur again, \u2018which mountains?\u2019 \u2018The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet \u2026\u2019 \u2018Which land was that? I didn\u2019t quite catch it.\u2019 \u2018Sevorbeupstry, on the planet \u2026\u2019 \u2018Sevorbe what?\u2019 \u2018Oh, for Heaven\u2019s sake,\u2019 said Prak and died testily.",
        "In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message, but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of finding a nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a quiet retired life.",
        "Having saved the Universe twice in one day he thought that he could take things a little easier from now on.",
        "They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which was now once again an idyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did occasionally get on his nerves.",
        "He spent a lot of time flying.",
        "He learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their conversation was fantastically boring.",
        "It was all to do with wind speed, wing spans, power to weight ratios and a fair bit about berries.",
        "Unfortunately, he discovered, once you have learnt birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it the whole time, just inane bird chatter.",
        "There is no getting away from it.",
        "For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to live on the ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane chatter he heard down there as well.",
        "One day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing tune he\u2019d heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from the sky and landed in front of him.",
        "A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey green alien marched out and approached him.",

        "He frowned.",
        "He looked up at him again.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve done you before, haven\u2019t I?\u2019 he said.",

If so, pick up the story in the next part of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series.",
        "An extract follows here from SO LONG, AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH Prologue Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.",
        "Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.",
        "This planet has \u2013 or had \u2013 a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.",
        "Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper which were unhappy.",
        "And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were unhappy, even the ones with digital watches.",
        "Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.",
        "And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.",
        "And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\u00e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.",
        "This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.",
        "Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever.",
        "This is her story.",
        "1 That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of year.",
        "It was cold and windy, which was normal.",
        "It started to rain, which was particularly normal.",
        "A spacecraft landed, which was not.",
        "There was nobody around to see it except for some spectacularly stupid quadrupeds who hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what to make of it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it, or what.",
        "So they did what they did to everything which was to run away from it and try to hide under each other, which never worked.",
        "It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single beam of light.",
        "From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was strangely beautiful \u2013 a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form: quite small.",
        "Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to take the findings of the latest Mid Galactic Census report as any kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would be right.",
        "You\u2019d probably guessed that anyway.",
        "The Census report, like most such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn\u2019t tell anybody anything they didn\u2019t already know \u2013 except that every single person in the Galaxy had 2.4 legs and owned a hyena.",
        "Since this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be scrapped.",
        "The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows.",
        "It hummed very quietly, a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy throb.",
        "At last it dropped and was quiet.",
        "A hatchway opened.",
        "A short flight of steps unfolded itself.",
        "A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out into the wet night, and shadows moved within.",
        "A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its arm.",
        "It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back to the ship.",
        "Already the rain was streaming through its hair.",
        "\u2018Thank you,\u2019 he called out, \u2018thank you very\u2014\u2019 He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder.",
        "He glanced up apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which he now discovered had a hole in the bottom.",
        "It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) DUTY FREE MEGA MARKET, PORT BRASTA, ALPHA CENTAURI.",
        "BE LIKE THE TWENTY SECOND ELEPHANT WITH HEATED VALUE IN SPACE \u2013 BARK! \u2018Hold on!\u2019 the figure called, waving at the ship.",
        "The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the hatchway, stopped, re unfolded, and allowed him back in.",
        "He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag.",
        "He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had already begun its ascent.",
        "Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the trees a wide berth.",
        "He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was falling now with ever increasing concentration, as if being pulled from the sky.",
        "His feet sloshed through the mud.",
        "Thunder grumbled over the hills.",
        "He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled on.",
        "More lights.",
        "Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights which played slowly over the horizon and faded.",
        "The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his pace, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which they had appeared.",
        "And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an obstacle.",
        "The figure paused to examine the barrier and then dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over himself.",
        "Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights streaming through the wall of water.",
        "The figure pressed back as the machine streaked towards him.",
        "It was a low bulbous shape, like a small whale surfing \u2013 sleek, grey and rounded and moving at terrifying speed.",
        "The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself, but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past and off into the night.",
        "It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside a split second to read a small sign at the back of the machine before it disappeared.",
        "To the figure\u2019s apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read, \u2018My other car is also a Porsche.\u2019 2 Rob McKenna was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he\u2019d had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he disliked, which included, at the last count, everybody.",
        "He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear.",
        "The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with Danish thermostatic radiator controls.",
        "It wasn\u2019t that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at least he hoped not.",
        "It was just the rain which got him down, always the rain.",
        "It was raining now, just for a change.",
        "It was a particular type of rain that he particularly disliked, particularly when he was driving.",
        "He had a number for it.",
        "It was rain type 17.",
        "He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous.",
        "So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbour\u2019s boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them the huskies have pissed on.",
        "Rob McKenna had two hundred and thirty one different types of rain entered in his little book, and he didn\u2019t like any of them.",
        "He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up.",
        "It grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying.",
        "Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been through types 33 (light pricking drizzle which made the roads slippery), 39 (heavy spotting), 47 to 51 (vertical light drizzle through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle freshening), 87 and 88 (two finely distinguished varieties of vertical torrential downpour), 100 (post downpour squalling, cold), all the seastorm types between 192 and 213 at once, 123, 124, 126, 127 (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and syncopated cab drumming), 11 (breezy droplets) and now his least favourite of all, 17.",
        "Rain type 17 was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen so hard that it didn\u2019t make much odds whether he had his wipers on or off.",
        "He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse.",
        "It just failed to get better again when he turned them back on.",
        "In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off.",
        "Swish swish swish flop swish swish flop swish swish flop swish flop swish flop flop flap scrape.",
        "He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow, thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore and swore and swore.",
        "It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the blatter, a figure by the roadside.",
        "A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter in a washing machine, and hitching.",
        "\u2018Poor miserable sod,\u2019 thought Rob McKenna to himself, realizing that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by than himself, \u2018must be chilled to the bone.",
        "Stupid to be out hitching on a filthy night like this.",
        "All you get is cold, wet, and lorries driving through puddles at you.\u2019 He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a turn and hit a large sheet of water square on.",
        "\u2018See what I mean?\u2019 he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly through it.",
        "\u2018You get some right bastards on the road.\u2019 Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the reflection of the hitchhiker, drenched by the roadside.",
        "For a moment he felt good about this.",
        "A moment or two later he felt bad about feeling good about it.",
        "Then he felt good about feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on into the night.",
        "At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty miles.",
        "And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after him, for, though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a Rain God.",
        "All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays.",
        "All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water him.",
