Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Captain. DUNCAN. What bloody man is that? He can report, As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt The newest state. MALCOLM. This is the sergeant Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought \u2019Gainst my captivity.\u2014Hail, brave friend! Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it. SOLDIER. Doubtful it stood; As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald (Worthy to be a rebel, for to that The multiplying villainies of nature Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied; And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling, Show\u2019d like a rebel\u2019s whore. But all\u2019s too weak; For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name), Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish\u2019d steel, Which smok\u2019d with bloody execution, Like Valour\u2019s minion, carv\u2019d out his passage, Till he fac\u2019d the slave; Which ne\u2019er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, Till he unseam\u2019d him from the nave to the chops, And fix\u2019d his head upon our battlements. DUNCAN. O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman! SOLDIER. As whence the sun \u2019gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring, whence comfort seem\u2019d to come Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valour arm\u2019d, Compell\u2019d these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbish\u2019d arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault. DUNCAN. Dismay\u2019d not this Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo? SOLDIER. Yes; As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. If I say sooth, I must report they were As cannons overcharg\u2019d with double cracks; So they Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe: Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, Or memorize another Golgotha, I cannot tell\u2014 But I am faint, my gashes cry for help. DUNCAN. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds: They smack of honour both.\u2014Go, get him surgeons. [_Exit Captain, attended._] Enter Ross and Angus. Who comes here? MALCOLM. The worthy Thane of Ross. LENNOX. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look That seems to speak things strange. ROSS. God save the King! DUNCAN. Whence cam\u2019st thou, worthy thane? ROSS. From Fife, great King, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor, The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; Till that Bellona\u2019s bridegroom, lapp\u2019d in proof, Confronted him with self comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm \u2019gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, The victory fell on us. DUNCAN. Great happiness! ROSS. That now Sweno, the Norways\u2019 king, craves composition; Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme\u2019s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use. DUNCAN. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death, And with his former title greet Macbeth. ROSS. I\u2019ll see it done. DUNCAN. What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. A heath. Thunder. Enter the three Witches. FIRST WITCH. Where hast thou been, sister? SECOND WITCH. Killing swine. THIRD WITCH. Sister, where thou? FIRST WITCH. A sailor\u2019s wife had chestnuts in her lap, And mounch\u2019d, and mounch\u2019d, and mounch\u2019d. \u201cGive me,\u201d quoth I. \u201cAroint thee, witch!\u201d the rump fed ronyon cries. Her husband\u2019s to Aleppo gone, master o\u2019 th\u2019 _Tiger:_ But in a sieve I\u2019ll thither sail, And, like a rat without a tail, I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll do, and I\u2019ll do. SECOND WITCH. I\u2019ll give thee a wind. FIRST WITCH. Th\u2019art kind. THIRD WITCH. And I another. FIRST WITCH. I myself have all the other, And the very ports they blow, All the quarters that they know I\u2019 the shipman\u2019s card. I will drain him dry as hay: Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his pent house lid; He shall live a man forbid. Weary sev\u2019n nights nine times nine, Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine: Though his bark cannot be lost, Yet it shall be tempest tost. Look what I have. SECOND WITCH. Show me, show me. FIRST WITCH. Here I have a pilot\u2019s thumb, Wrack\u2019d as homeward he did come. [_Drum within._] THIRD WITCH. A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come. ALL. The Weird Sisters, hand in hand, Posters of the sea and land, Thus do go about, about: Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine, And thrice again, to make up nine. Peace!\u2014the charm\u2019s wound up. Enter Macbeth and Banquo. MACBETH. So foul and fair a day I have not seen. BANQUO. How far is\u2019t call\u2019d to Forres?\u2014What are these, So wither\u2019d, and so wild in their attire, That look not like the inhabitants o\u2019 th\u2019 earth, And yet are on\u2019t?\u2014Live you? or are you aught That man may question? You seem to understand me, By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips. You should be women, And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so. MACBETH. Speak, if you can;\u2014what are you? FIRST WITCH. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis! SECOND WITCH. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor! THIRD WITCH. All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter! BANQUO. Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair?\u2014I\u2019 th\u2019 name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow, and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate. FIRST WITCH. Hail! SECOND WITCH. Hail! THIRD WITCH. Hail! FIRST WITCH. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater. SECOND WITCH. Not so happy, yet much happier. THIRD WITCH. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo! FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! MACBETH. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more. By Sinel\u2019s death I know I am Thane of Glamis; But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives, A prosperous gentleman; and to be king Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence? or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting?\u2014Speak, I charge you. [_Witches vanish._] BANQUO. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has, And these are of them. Whither are they vanish\u2019d? MACBETH. Into the air; and what seem\u2019d corporal, Melted as breath into the wind. Would they had stay\u2019d! BANQUO. Were such things here as we do speak about? Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner? MACBETH. Your children shall be kings. BANQUO. You shall be king. MACBETH. And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so? BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who\u2019s here? Enter Ross and Angus. ROSS. The King hath happily receiv\u2019d, Macbeth, The news of thy success, and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels\u2019 fight, His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his: silenc\u2019d with that, In viewing o\u2019er the rest o\u2019 th\u2019 selfsame day, He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, Strange images of death. As thick as tale Came post with post; and everyone did bear Thy praises in his kingdom\u2019s great defence, And pour\u2019d them down before him. ANGUS. We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks; Only to herald thee into his sight, Not pay thee. ROSS. And, for an earnest of a greater honour, He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor: In which addition, hail, most worthy thane, For it is thine. BANQUO. What, can the devil speak true? MACBETH. The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me In borrow\u2019d robes? ANGUS. Who was the Thane lives yet, But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin\u2019d With those of Norway, or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage, or that with both He labour\u2019d in his country\u2019s wrack, I know not; But treasons capital, confess\u2019d and prov\u2019d, Have overthrown him. MACBETH. [_Aside._] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor: The greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains. [_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kings, When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me Promis\u2019d no less to them? BANQUO. That, trusted home, Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But \u2019tis strange: And oftentimes to win us to our harm, The instruments of darkness tell us truths; Win us with honest trifles, to betray\u2019s In deepest consequence.\u2014 Cousins, a word, I pray you. MACBETH. [_Aside._] Two truths are told, As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme.\u2014I thank you, gentlemen.\u2014 [_Aside._] This supernatural soliciting Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill, Why hath it given me earnest of success, Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor: If good, why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair, And make my seated heart knock at my ribs, Against the use of nature? Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings. My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical, Shakes so my single state of man That function is smother\u2019d in surmise, And nothing is but what is not. BANQUO. Look, how our partner\u2019s rapt. MACBETH. [_Aside._] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me Without my stir. BANQUO. New honours come upon him, Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould But with the aid of use. MACBETH. [_Aside._] Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. BANQUO. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure. MACBETH. Give me your favour. My dull brain was wrought With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains Are register\u2019d where every day I turn The leaf to read them.\u2014Let us toward the King.\u2014 Think upon what hath chanc\u2019d; and at more time, The interim having weigh\u2019d it, let us speak Our free hearts each to other. BANQUO. Very gladly. MACBETH. Till then, enough.\u2014Come, friends. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. Forres. A Room in the Palace. Flourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox and Attendants. DUNCAN. Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not Those in commission yet return\u2019d? MALCOLM. My liege, They are not yet come back. But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report, That very frankly he confess\u2019d his treasons, Implor\u2019d your Highness\u2019 pardon, and set forth A deep repentance. Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it; he died As one that had been studied in his death, To throw away the dearest thing he ow\u2019d As \u2019twere a careless trifle. DUNCAN. There\u2019s no art To find the mind\u2019s construction in the face: He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust. Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus. O worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before, That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv\u2019d; That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine! only I have left to say, More is thy due than more than all can pay. MACBETH. The service and the loyalty I owe, In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness\u2019 part Is to receive our duties: and our duties Are to your throne and state, children and servants; Which do but what they should, by doing everything Safe toward your love and honour. DUNCAN. Welcome hither: I have begun to plant thee, and will labour To make thee full of growing.\u2014Noble Banquo, That hast no less deserv\u2019d, nor must be known No less to have done so, let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart. BANQUO. There if I grow, The harvest is your own. DUNCAN. My plenteous joys, Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow.\u2014Sons, kinsmen, thanes, And you whose places are the nearest, know, We will establish our estate upon Our eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland: which honour must Not unaccompanied invest him only, But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine On all deservers.\u2014From hence to Inverness, And bind us further to you. MACBETH. The rest is labour, which is not us\u2019d for you: I\u2019ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach; So, humbly take my leave. DUNCAN. My worthy Cawdor! MACBETH. [_Aside._] The Prince of Cumberland!\u2014That is a step On which I must fall down, or else o\u2019erleap, For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires! Let not light see my black and deep desires. The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be, Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. [_Exit._] DUNCAN. True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant; And in his commendations I am fed. It is a banquet to me. Let\u2019s after him, Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome: It is a peerless kinsman. [_Flourish. Exeunt._] SCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbeth\u2019s Castle. Enter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter. LADY MACBETH. \u201cThey met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the perfect\u2019st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all hailed me, \u2018Thane of Cawdor\u2019; by which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with \u2018Hail, king that shalt be!\u2019 This have I thought good to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou might\u2019st not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promis\u2019d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.\u201d Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be What thou art promis\u2019d. Yet do I fear thy nature; It is too full o\u2019 th\u2019 milk of human kindness To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great; Art not without ambition, but without The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly, That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false, And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou\u2019dst have, great Glamis, That which cries, \u201cThus thou must do,\u201d if thou have it; And that which rather thou dost fear to do, Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither, That I may pour my spirits in thine ear, And chastise with the valour of my tongue All that impedes thee from the golden round, Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem To have thee crown\u2019d withal. Enter a Messenger. What is your tidings? MESSENGER. The King comes here tonight. LADY MACBETH. Thou\u2019rt mad to say it. Is not thy master with him? who, were\u2019t so, Would have inform\u2019d for preparation. MESSENGER. So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming. One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message. LADY MACBETH. Give him tending. He brings great news. [_Exit Messenger._] The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements. Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me, from the crown to the toe, top full Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood, Stop up th\u2019 access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between Th\u2019 effect and it! Come to my woman\u2019s breasts, And take my milk for gall, your murd\u2019ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature\u2019s mischief! Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry, \u201cHold, hold!\u201d Enter Macbeth. Great Glamis, worthy Cawdor! Greater than both, by the all hail hereafter! Thy letters have transported me beyond This ignorant present, and I feel now The future in the instant. MACBETH. My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight. LADY MACBETH. And when goes hence? MACBETH. Tomorrow, as he purposes. LADY MACBETH. O, never Shall sun that morrow see! Your face, my thane, is as a book where men May read strange matters. To beguile the time, Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye, Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower, But be the serpent under\u2019t. He that\u2019s coming Must be provided for; and you shall put This night\u2019s great business into my dispatch; Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom. MACBETH. We will speak further. LADY MACBETH. Only look up clear; To alter favour ever is to fear. Leave all the rest to me. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VI. The same. Before the Castle. Hautboys. Servants of Macbeth attending. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus and Attendants. DUNCAN. This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses. BANQUO. This guest of summer, The temple haunting martlet, does approve, By his loved mansionry, that the heaven\u2019s breath Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle. Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ\u2019d The air is delicate. Enter Lady Macbeth. DUNCAN. See, see, our honour\u2019d hostess!\u2014 The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you How you shall bid God \u2019ild us for your pains, And thank us for your trouble. LADY MACBETH. All our service, In every point twice done, and then done double, Were poor and single business to contend Against those honours deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house: for those of old, And the late dignities heap\u2019d up to them, We rest your hermits. DUNCAN. Where\u2019s the Thane of Cawdor? We cours\u2019d him at the heels, and had a purpose To be his purveyor: but he rides well; And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess, We are your guest tonight. LADY MACBETH. Your servants ever Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt, To make their audit at your Highness\u2019 pleasure, Still to return your own. DUNCAN. Give me your hand; Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly, And shall continue our graces towards him. By your leave, hostess. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VII. The same. A Lobby in the Castle. Hautboys and torches. Enter, and pass over, a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth. MACBETH. If it were done when \u2019tis done, then \u2019twere well It were done quickly. If th\u2019 assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success; that but this blow Might be the be all and the end all\u2014here, But here, upon this bank and shoal of time, We\u2019d jump the life to come. But in these cases We still have judgement here; that we but teach Bloody instructions, which being taught, return To plague th\u2019 inventor. This even handed justice Commends th\u2019 ingredience of our poison\u2019d chalice To our own lips. He\u2019s here in double trust: First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, Who should against his murderer shut the door, Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been So clear in his great office, that his virtues Will plead like angels, trumpet tongued, against The deep damnation of his taking off; And pity, like a naked new born babe, Striding the blast, or heaven\u2019s cherubin, hors\u2019d Upon the sightless couriers of the air, Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, That tears shall drown the wind.\u2014I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent, but only Vaulting ambition, which o\u2019erleaps itself And falls on th\u2019 other\u2014 Enter Lady Macbeth. How now! what news? LADY MACBETH. He has almost supp\u2019d. Why have you left the chamber? MACBETH. Hath he ask\u2019d for me? LADY MACBETH. Know you not he has? MACBETH. We will proceed no further in this business: He hath honour\u2019d me of late; and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon. LADY MACBETH. Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress\u2019d yourself? Hath it slept since? And wakes it now, to look so green and pale At what it did so freely? From this time Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem\u2019st the ornament of life, And live a coward in thine own esteem, Letting \u201cI dare not\u201d wait upon \u201cI would,\u201d Like the poor cat i\u2019 th\u2019 adage? MACBETH. Pr\u2019ythee, peace! I dare do all that may become a man; Who dares do more is none. LADY MACBETH. What beast was\u2019t, then, That made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; And, to be more than what you were, you would Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place Did then adhere, and yet you would make both: They have made themselves, and that their fitness now Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know How tender \u2019tis to love the babe that milks me: I would, while it was smiling in my face, Have pluck\u2019d my nipple from his boneless gums And dash\u2019d the brains out, had I so sworn as you Have done to this. MACBETH. If we should fail? LADY MACBETH. We fail? But screw your courage to the sticking place, And we\u2019ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep (Whereto the rather shall his day\u2019s hard journey Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory, the warder of the brain, Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death, What cannot you and I perform upon Th\u2019 unguarded Duncan? what not put upon His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell? MACBETH. Bring forth men children only; For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv\u2019d, When we have mark\u2019d with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber, and us\u2019d their very daggers, That they have done\u2019t? LADY MACBETH. Who dares receive it other, As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar Upon his death? MACBETH. I am settled, and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat. Away, and mock the time with fairest show: False face must hide what the false heart doth know. [_Exeunt._] ACT II SCENE I. Inverness. Court within the Castle. Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch before him. BANQUO. How goes the night, boy? FLEANCE. The moon is down; I have not heard the clock. BANQUO. And she goes down at twelve. FLEANCE. I take\u2019t, \u2019tis later, sir. BANQUO. Hold, take my sword.\u2014There\u2019s husbandry in heaven; Their candles are all out. Take thee that too. A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers, Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose! Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch. Give me my sword.\u2014Who\u2019s there? MACBETH. A friend. BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King\u2019s abed: He hath been in unusual pleasure and Sent forth great largess to your offices. This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content. MACBETH. Being unprepar\u2019d, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought. BANQUO. All\u2019s well. I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters: To you they have show\u2019d some truth. MACBETH. I think not of them: Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time. BANQUO. At your kind\u2019st leisure. MACBETH. If you shall cleave to my consent, when \u2019tis, It shall make honour for you. BANQUO. So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchis\u2019d, and allegiance clear, I shall be counsell\u2019d. MACBETH. Good repose the while! BANQUO. Thanks, sir: the like to you. [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._] MACBETH. Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready, She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. [_Exit Servant._] Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:\u2014 I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat oppressed brain? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw. Thou marshall\u2019st me the way that I was going; And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o\u2019 the other senses, Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still; And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood, Which was not so before.\u2014There\u2019s no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes.\u2014Now o\u2019er the one half world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtain\u2019d sleep. Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate\u2019s off\u2019rings; and wither\u2019d murder, Alarum\u2019d by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl\u2019s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin\u2019s ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost.\u2014Thou sure and firm set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it.\u2014Whiles I threat, he lives. Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. [_A bell rings._] I go, and it is done. The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell. [_Exit._] SCENE II. The same. Enter Lady Macbeth. LADY MACBETH. That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold: What hath quench\u2019d them hath given me fire.\u2014Hark!\u2014Peace! It was the owl that shriek\u2019d, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern\u2019st good night. He is about it. The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg\u2019d their possets, That death and nature do contend about them, Whether they live or die. MACBETH. [_Within._] Who\u2019s there?\u2014what, ho! LADY MACBETH. Alack! I am afraid they have awak\u2019d, And \u2019tis not done. Th\u2019 attempt and not the deed Confounds us.\u2014Hark!\u2014I laid their daggers ready; He could not miss \u2019em.\u2014Had he not resembled My father as he slept, I had done\u2019t.\u2014My husband! Enter Macbeth. MACBETH. I have done the deed.\u2014Didst thou not hear a noise? LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Did not you speak? MACBETH. When? LADY MACBETH. Now. MACBETH. As I descended? LADY MACBETH. Ay. MACBETH. Hark!\u2014Who lies i\u2019 th\u2019 second chamber? LADY MACBETH. Donalbain. MACBETH. This is a sorry sight. [_Looking on his hands._] LADY MACBETH. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. MACBETH. There\u2019s one did laugh in\u2019s sleep, and one cried, \u201cMurder!\u201d That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them. But they did say their prayers, and address\u2019d them Again to sleep. LADY MACBETH. There are two lodg\u2019d together. MACBETH. One cried, \u201cGod bless us!\u201d and, \u201cAmen,\u201d the other, As they had seen me with these hangman\u2019s hands. List\u2019ning their fear, I could not say \u201cAmen,\u201d When they did say, \u201cGod bless us.\u201d LADY MACBETH. Consider it not so deeply. MACBETH. But wherefore could not I pronounce \u201cAmen\u201d? I had most need of blessing, and \u201cAmen\u201d Stuck in my throat. LADY MACBETH. These deeds must not be thought After these ways; so, it will make us mad. MACBETH. Methought I heard a voice cry, \u201cSleep no more! Macbeth does murder sleep,\u201d\u2014the innocent sleep; Sleep that knits up the ravell\u2019d sleave of care, The death of each day\u2019s life, sore labour\u2019s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature\u2019s second course, Chief nourisher in life\u2019s feast. LADY MACBETH. What do you mean? MACBETH. Still it cried, \u201cSleep no more!\u201d to all the house: \u201cGlamis hath murder\u2019d sleep, and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!\u201d LADY MACBETH. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.\u2014 Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there: go carry them, and smear The sleepy grooms with blood. MACBETH. I\u2019ll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on\u2019t again I dare not. LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. \u2019Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I\u2019ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt. [_Exit. Knocking within._] MACBETH. Whence is that knocking? How is\u2019t with me, when every noise appals me? What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes! Will all great Neptune\u2019s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red. Enter Lady Macbeth. LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knocking At the south entry:\u2014retire we to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed: How easy is it then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended.\u2014[_Knocking within._] Hark, more knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts. MACBETH. To know my deed, \u2019twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._] Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. The same. Enter a Porter. Knocking within. PORTER. Here\u2019s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock. Who\u2019s there, i\u2019 th\u2019 name of Belzebub? Here\u2019s a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you; here you\u2019ll sweat for\u2019t. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock! Who\u2019s there, i\u2019 th\u2019 other devil\u2019s name? Faith, here\u2019s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for God\u2019s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who\u2019s there? Faith, here\u2019s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?\u2014But this place is too cold for hell. I\u2019ll devil porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th\u2019 everlasting bonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter. [_Opens the gate._] Enter Macduff and Lennox. MACDUFF. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late? PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. MACDUFF. What three things does drink especially provoke? PORTER. Marry, sir, nose painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him. MACDUFF. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. PORTER. That it did, sir, i\u2019 the very throat on me; but I requited him for his lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him. MACDUFF. Is thy master stirring? Enter Macbeth. Our knocking has awak\u2019d him; here he comes. LENNOX. Good morrow, noble sir! MACBETH. Good morrow, both! MACDUFF. Is the King stirring, worthy thane? MACBETH. Not yet. MACDUFF. He did command me to call timely on him. I have almost slipp\u2019d the hour. MACBETH. I\u2019ll bring you to him. MACDUFF. I know this is a joyful trouble to you; But yet \u2019tis one. MACBETH. The labour we delight in physics pain. This is the door. MACDUFF. I\u2019ll make so bold to call. For \u2019tis my limited service. [_Exit Macduff._] LENNOX. Goes the King hence today? MACBETH. He does. He did appoint so. LENNOX. The night has been unruly: where we lay, Our chimneys were blown down and, as they say, Lamentings heard i\u2019 th\u2019 air, strange screams of death, And prophesying, with accents terrible, Of dire combustion and confus\u2019d events, New hatch\u2019d to the woeful time. The obscure bird Clamour\u2019d the live long night. Some say the earth Was feverous, and did shake. MACBETH. \u2019Twas a rough night. LENNOX. My young remembrance cannot parallel A fellow to it. Enter Macduff. MACDUFF. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee! MACBETH, LENNOX. What\u2019s the matter? MACDUFF. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece! Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope The Lord\u2019s anointed temple, and stole thence The life o\u2019 th\u2019 building. MACBETH. What is\u2019t you say? the life? LENNOX. Mean you his majesty? MACDUFF. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak. See, and then speak yourselves. [_Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox._] Awake, awake!\u2014 Ring the alarum bell.\u2014Murder and treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake! Shake off this downy sleep, death\u2019s counterfeit, And look on death itself! Up, up, and see The great doom\u2019s image. Malcolm! Banquo! As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites To countenance this horror! [_Alarum bell rings._] Enter Lady Macbeth. LADY MACBETH. What\u2019s the business, That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak! MACDUFF. O gentle lady, \u2019Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman\u2019s ear, Would murder as it fell. Enter Banquo. O Banquo, Banquo! Our royal master\u2019s murder\u2019d! LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas! What, in our house? BANQUO. Too cruel anywhere.\u2014 Dear Duff, I pr\u2019ythee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so. Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross. MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had liv\u2019d a blessed time; for, from this instant There\u2019s nothing serious in mortality. All is but toys: renown and grace is dead; The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of. Enter Malcolm and Donalbain. DONALBAIN. What is amiss? MACBETH. You are, and do not know\u2019t: The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood Is stopp\u2019d; the very source of it is stopp\u2019d. MACDUFF. Your royal father\u2019s murder\u2019d. MALCOLM. O, by whom? LENNOX. Those of his chamber, as it seem\u2019d, had done\u2019t: Their hands and faces were all badg\u2019d with blood; So were their daggers, which, unwip\u2019d, we found Upon their pillows. They star\u2019d, and were distracted; No man\u2019s life was to be trusted with them. MACBETH. O, yet I do repent me of my fury, That I did kill them. MACDUFF. Wherefore did you so? MACBETH. Who can be wise, amaz\u2019d, temperate, and furious, Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man: Th\u2019 expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan, His silver skin lac\u2019d with his golden blood; And his gash\u2019d stabs look\u2019d like a breach in nature For ruin\u2019s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers, Steep\u2019d in the colours of their trade, their daggers Unmannerly breech\u2019d with gore. Who could refrain, That had a heart to love, and in that heart Courage to make\u2019s love known? LADY MACBETH. Help me hence, ho! MACDUFF. Look to the lady. MALCOLM. Why do we hold our tongues, That most may claim this argument for ours? DONALBAIN. What should be spoken here, where our fate, Hid in an auger hole, may rush, and seize us? Let\u2019s away. Our tears are not yet brew\u2019d. MALCOLM. Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion. BANQUO. Look to the lady:\u2014 [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._] And when we have our naked frailties hid, That suffer in exposure, let us meet, And question this most bloody piece of work To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us: In the great hand of God I stand; and thence Against the undivulg\u2019d pretence I fight Of treasonous malice. MACDUFF. And so do I. ALL. So all. MACBETH. Let\u2019s briefly put on manly readiness, And meet i\u2019 th\u2019 hall together. ALL. Well contented. [_Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain._] MALCOLM. What will you do? Let\u2019s not consort with them: To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy. I\u2019ll to England. DONALBAIN. To Ireland, I. Our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are, There\u2019s daggers in men\u2019s smiles: the near in blood, The nearer bloody. MALCOLM. This murderous shaft that\u2019s shot Hath not yet lighted; and our safest way Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse; And let us not be dainty of leave taking, But shift away. There\u2019s warrant in that theft Which steals itself, when there\u2019s no mercy left. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. The same. Without the Castle. Enter Ross and an Old Man. OLD MAN. Threescore and ten I can remember well, Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings. ROSS. Ha, good father, Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man\u2019s act, Threatens his bloody stage: by the clock \u2019tis day, And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp. Is\u2019t night\u2019s predominance, or the day\u2019s shame, That darkness does the face of earth entomb, When living light should kiss it? OLD MAN. \u2019Tis unnatural, Even like the deed that\u2019s done. On Tuesday last, A falcon, towering in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawk\u2019d at and kill\u2019d. ROSS. And Duncan\u2019s horses (a thing most strange and certain) Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turn\u2019d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending \u2019gainst obedience, as they would make War with mankind. OLD MAN. \u2019Tis said they eat each other. ROSS. They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes, That look\u2019d upon\u2019t. Here comes the good Macduff. Enter Macduff. How goes the world, sir, now? MACDUFF. Why, see you not? ROSS. Is\u2019t known who did this more than bloody deed? MACDUFF. Those that Macbeth hath slain. ROSS. Alas, the day! What good could they pretend? MACDUFF. They were suborn\u2019d. Malcolm and Donalbain, the King\u2019s two sons, Are stol\u2019n away and fled; which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed. ROSS. \u2019Gainst nature still: Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up Thine own life\u2019s means!\u2014Then \u2019tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth. MACDUFF. He is already nam\u2019d; and gone to Scone To be invested. ROSS. Where is Duncan\u2019s body? MACDUFF. Carried to Colmekill, The sacred storehouse of his predecessors, And guardian of their bones. ROSS. Will you to Scone? MACDUFF. No, cousin, I\u2019ll to Fife. ROSS. Well, I will thither. MACDUFF. Well, may you see things well done there. Adieu! Lest our old robes sit easier than our new! ROSS. Farewell, father. OLD MAN. God\u2019s benison go with you; and with those That would make good of bad, and friends of foes! [_Exeunt._] ACT III SCENE I. Forres. A Room in the Palace. Enter Banquo. BANQUO. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all, As the Weird Women promis\u2019d; and, I fear, Thou play\u2019dst most foully for\u2019t; yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity; But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings. If there come truth from them (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine) Why, by the verities on thee made good, May they not be my oracles as well, And set me up in hope? But hush; no more. Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox, Ross, Lords, and Attendants. MACBETH. Here\u2019s our chief guest. LADY MACBETH. If he had been forgotten, It had been as a gap in our great feast, And all thing unbecoming. MACBETH. Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, And I\u2019ll request your presence. BANQUO. Let your Highness Command upon me, to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie For ever knit. MACBETH. Ride you this afternoon? BANQUO. Ay, my good lord. MACBETH. We should have else desir\u2019d your good advice (Which still hath been both grave and prosperous) In this day\u2019s council; but we\u2019ll take tomorrow. Is\u2019t far you ride? BANQUO. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time \u2019Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better, I must become a borrower of the night, For a dark hour or twain. MACBETH. Fail not our feast. BANQUO. My lord, I will not. MACBETH. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow\u2019d In England and in Ireland; not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention. But of that tomorrow, When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu, Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you? BANQUO. Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon\u2019s. MACBETH. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot; And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.\u2014 [_Exit Banquo._] Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night; to make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you. [_Exeunt Lady Macbeth, Lords, &c._] Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men Our pleasure? SERVANT. They are, my lord, without the palace gate. MACBETH. Bring them before us. [_Exit Servant._] To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear\u2019d: \u2019tis much he dares; And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour To act in safety. There is none but he Whose being I do fear: and under him My genius is rebuk\u2019d; as, it is said, Mark Antony\u2019s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me, And bade them speak to him; then, prophet like, They hail\u2019d him father to a line of kings: Upon my head they plac\u2019d a fruitless crown, And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, Thence to be wrench\u2019d with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If\u2019t be so, For Banquo\u2019s issue have I fil\u2019d my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murder\u2019d; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings! Rather than so, come, fate, into the list, And champion me to th\u2019 utterance!\u2014Who\u2019s there?\u2014 Enter Servant with two Murderers. Now go to the door, and stay there till we call. [_Exit Servant._] Was it not yesterday we spoke together? FIRST MURDERER. It was, so please your Highness. MACBETH. Well then, now Have you consider\u2019d of my speeches? Know That it was he, in the times past, which held you So under fortune, which you thought had been Our innocent self? This I made good to you In our last conference, pass\u2019d in probation with you How you were borne in hand, how cross\u2019d, the instruments, Who wrought with them, and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion craz\u2019d Say, \u201cThus did Banquo.\u201d FIRST MURDERER. You made it known to us. MACBETH. I did so; and went further, which is now Our point of second meeting. Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature, That you can let this go? Are you so gospell\u2019d, To pray for this good man and for his issue, Whose heavy hand hath bow\u2019d you to the grave, And beggar\u2019d yours forever? FIRST MURDERER. We are men, my liege. MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men; As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, Shoughs, water rugs, and demi wolves are clept All by the name of dogs: the valu\u2019d file Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, The housekeeper, the hunter, every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him clos\u2019d; whereby he does receive Particular addition, from the bill That writes them all alike: and so of men. Now, if you have a station in the file, Not i\u2019 th\u2019 worst rank of manhood, say\u2019t; And I will put that business in your bosoms, Whose execution takes your enemy off, Grapples you to the heart and love of us, Who wear our health but sickly in his life, Which in his death were perfect. SECOND MURDERER. I am one, my liege, Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Hath so incens\u2019d that I am reckless what I do to spite the world. FIRST MURDERER. And I another, So weary with disasters, tugg\u2019d with fortune, That I would set my life on any chance, To mend it or be rid on\u2019t. MACBETH. Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy. BOTH MURDERERS. True, my lord. MACBETH. So is he mine; and in such bloody distance, That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near\u2019st of life; and though I could With barefac\u2019d power sweep him from my sight, And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not, For certain friends that are both his and mine, Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall Who I myself struck down: and thence it is That I to your assistance do make love, Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons. SECOND MURDERER. We shall, my lord, Perform what you command us. FIRST MURDERER. Though our lives\u2014 MACBETH. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most, I will advise you where to plant yourselves, Acquaint you with the perfect spy o\u2019 th\u2019 time, The moment on\u2019t; for\u2019t must be done tonight And something from the palace; always thought That I require a clearness. And with him (To leave no rubs nor botches in the work) Fleance his son, that keeps him company, Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father\u2019s, must embrace the fate Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart. I\u2019ll come to you anon. BOTH MURDERERS. We are resolv\u2019d, my lord. MACBETH. I\u2019ll call upon you straight: abide within. [_Exeunt Murderers._] It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul\u2019s flight, If it find heaven, must find it out tonight. [_Exit._] SCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace. Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant. LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court? SERVANT. Ay, madam, but returns again tonight. LADY MACBETH. Say to the King, I would attend his leisure For a few words. SERVANT. Madam, I will. [_Exit._] LADY MACBETH. Naught\u2019s had, all\u2019s spent, Where our desire is got without content: \u2019Tis safer to be that which we destroy, Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. Enter Macbeth. How now, my lord, why do you keep alone, Of sorriest fancies your companions making, Using those thoughts which should indeed have died With them they think on? Things without all remedy Should be without regard: what\u2019s done is done. MACBETH. We have scorch\u2019d the snake, not kill\u2019d it. She\u2019ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth. But let the frame of things disjoint, Both the worlds suffer, Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace, Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave; After life\u2019s fitful fever he sleeps well; Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further. LADY MACBETH. Come on, Gently my lord, sleek o\u2019er your rugged looks; Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight. MACBETH. So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you. Let your remembrance apply to Banquo; Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: Unsafe the while, that we Must lave our honours in these flattering streams, And make our faces vizards to our hearts, Disguising what they are. LADY MACBETH. You must leave this. MACBETH. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife! Thou know\u2019st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives. LADY MACBETH. But in them nature\u2019s copy\u2019s not eterne. MACBETH. There\u2019s comfort yet; they are assailable. Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown His cloister\u2019d flight, ere to black Hecate\u2019s summons The shard born beetle, with his drowsy hums, Hath rung night\u2019s yawning peal, there shall be done A deed of dreadful note. LADY MACBETH. What\u2019s to be done? MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale!\u2014Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to th\u2019 rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, Whiles night\u2019s black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell\u2019st at my words: but hold thee still; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, pr\u2019ythee, go with me. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace. Enter three Murderers. FIRST MURDERER. But who did bid thee join with us? THIRD MURDERER. Macbeth. SECOND MURDERER. He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just. FIRST MURDERER. Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day. Now spurs the lated traveller apace, To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch. THIRD MURDERER. Hark! I hear horses. BANQUO. [_Within._] Give us a light there, ho! SECOND MURDERER. Then \u2019tis he; the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i\u2019 th\u2019 court. FIRST MURDERER. His horses go about. THIRD MURDERER. Almost a mile; but he does usually, So all men do, from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk. Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch. SECOND MURDERER. A light, a light! THIRD MURDERER. \u2019Tis he. FIRST MURDERER. Stand to\u2019t. BANQUO. It will be rain tonight. FIRST MURDERER. Let it come down. [_Assaults Banquo._] BANQUO. O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly! Thou mayst revenge\u2014O slave! [_Dies. Fleance escapes._] THIRD MURDERER. Who did strike out the light? FIRST MURDERER. Was\u2019t not the way? THIRD MURDERER. There\u2019s but one down: the son is fled. SECOND MURDERER. We have lost best half of our affair. FIRST MURDERER. Well, let\u2019s away, and say how much is done. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace. A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords and Attendants. MACBETH. You know your own degrees, sit down. At first And last the hearty welcome. LORDS. Thanks to your Majesty. MACBETH. Ourself will mingle with society, And play the humble host. Our hostess keeps her state; but, in best time, We will require her welcome. LADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends; For my heart speaks they are welcome. Enter first Murderer to the door. MACBETH. See, they encounter thee with their hearts\u2019 thanks. Both sides are even: here I\u2019ll sit i\u2019 th\u2019 midst. Be large in mirth; anon we\u2019ll drink a measure The table round. There\u2019s blood upon thy face. MURDERER. \u2019Tis Banquo\u2019s then. MACBETH. \u2019Tis better thee without than he within. Is he dispatch\u2019d? MURDERER. My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him. MACBETH. Thou art the best o\u2019 th\u2019 cut throats; Yet he\u2019s good that did the like for Fleance: If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil. MURDERER. Most royal sir, Fleance is \u2019scap\u2019d. MACBETH. Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect; Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air: But now I am cabin\u2019d, cribb\u2019d, confin\u2019d, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo\u2019s safe? MURDERER. Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head; The least a death to nature. MACBETH. Thanks for that. There the grown serpent lies; the worm that\u2019s fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for th\u2019 present.\u2014Get thee gone; tomorrow We\u2019ll hear, ourselves, again. [_Exit Murderer._] LADY MACBETH. My royal lord, You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold That is not often vouch\u2019d, while \u2019tis a making, \u2019Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home; From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; Meeting were bare without it. The Ghost of Banquo rises, and sits in Macbeth\u2019s place. MACBETH. Sweet remembrancer!\u2014 Now, good digestion wait on appetite, And health on both! LENNOX. May\u2019t please your Highness sit. MACBETH. Here had we now our country\u2019s honour roof\u2019d, Were the grac\u2019d person of our Banquo present; Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance! ROSS. His absence, sir, Lays blame upon his promise. Please\u2019t your Highness To grace us with your royal company? MACBETH. The table\u2019s full. LENNOX. Here is a place reserv\u2019d, sir. MACBETH. Where? LENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is\u2019t that moves your Highness? MACBETH. Which of you have done this? LORDS. What, my good lord? MACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it. Never shake Thy gory locks at me. ROSS. Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is not well. LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus, And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat; The fit is momentary; upon a thought He will again be well. If much you note him, You shall offend him, and extend his passion. Feed, and regard him not.\u2014Are you a man? MACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that Which might appal the devil. LADY MACBETH. O proper stuff! This is the very painting of your fear: This is the air drawn dagger which you said, Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts (Impostors to true fear), would well become A woman\u2019s story at a winter\u2019s fire, Authoris\u2019d by her grandam. Shame itself! Why do you make such faces? When all\u2019s done, You look but on a stool. MACBETH. Pr\u2019ythee, see there! Behold! look! lo! how say you? Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.\u2014 If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back, our monuments Shall be the maws of kites. [_Ghost disappears._] LADY MACBETH. What, quite unmann\u2019d in folly? MACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him. LADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame! MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i\u2019 th\u2019 olden time, Ere humane statute purg\u2019d the gentle weal; Ay, and since too, murders have been perform\u2019d Too terrible for the ear: the time has been, That, when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again, With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools. This is more strange Than such a murder is. LADY MACBETH. My worthy lord, Your noble friends do lack you. MACBETH. I do forget.\u2014 Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends. I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing To those that know me. Come, love and health to all; Then I\u2019ll sit down.\u2014Give me some wine, fill full.\u2014 I drink to the general joy o\u2019 th\u2019 whole table, And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss: Would he were here. Ghost rises again. To all, and him, we thirst, And all to all. LORDS. Our duties, and the pledge. MACBETH. Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold; Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with! LADY MACBETH. Think of this, good peers, But as a thing of custom: \u2019tis no other, Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. MACBETH. What man dare, I dare: Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, The arm\u2019d rhinoceros, or th\u2019 Hyrcan tiger; Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves Shall never tremble: or be alive again, And dare me to the desert with thy sword; If trembling I inhabit then, protest me The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mock\u2019ry, hence! [_Ghost disappears._] Why, so;\u2014being gone, I am a man again.\u2014Pray you, sit still. LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting With most admir\u2019d disorder. MACBETH. Can such things be, And overcome us like a summer\u2019s cloud, Without our special wonder? You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe, When now I think you can behold such sights, And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks, When mine are blanch\u2019d with fear. ROSS. What sights, my lord? LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good night:\u2014 Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. LENNOX. Good night; and better health Attend his Majesty! LADY MACBETH. A kind good night to all! [_Exeunt all Lords and Attendants._] MACBETH. It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood. Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak; Augurs, and understood relations, have By magot pies, and choughs, and rooks, brought forth The secret\u2019st man of blood.\u2014What is the night? LADY MACBETH. Almost at odds with morning, which is which. MACBETH. How say\u2019st thou, that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding? LADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir? MACBETH. I hear it by the way; but I will send. There\u2019s not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant fee\u2019d. I will tomorrow (And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters: More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know, By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good, All causes shall give way: I am in blood Stepp\u2019d in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o\u2019er. Strange things I have in head, that will to hand, Which must be acted ere they may be scann\u2019d. LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep. MACBETH. Come, we\u2019ll to sleep. My strange and self abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. We are yet but young in deed. [_Exeunt._] SCENE V. The heath. Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate. FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? you look angerly. HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are, Saucy and overbold? How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death; And I, the mistress of your charms, The close contriver of all harms, Was never call\u2019d to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? And, which is worse, all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son, Spiteful and wrathful; who, as others do, Loves for his own ends, not for you. But make amends now: get you gone, And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i\u2019 th\u2019 morning: thither he Will come to know his destiny. Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms, and everything beside. I am for th\u2019 air; this night I\u2019ll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end. Great business must be wrought ere noon. Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap\u2019rous drop profound; I\u2019ll catch it ere it come to ground: And that, distill\u2019d by magic sleights, Shall raise such artificial sprites, As, by the strength of their illusion, Shall draw him on to his confusion. He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear His hopes \u2019bove wisdom, grace, and fear. And you all know, security Is mortals\u2019 chiefest enemy. [_Music and song within, \u201cCome away, come away\u201d &c._] Hark! I am call\u2019d; my little spirit, see, Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me. [_Exit._] FIRST WITCH. Come, let\u2019s make haste; she\u2019ll soon be back again. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VI. Forres. A Room in the Palace. Enter Lennox and another Lord. LENNOX. My former speeches have but hit your thoughts, Which can interpret farther: only, I say, Thing\u2019s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth:\u2014marry, he was dead:\u2014 And the right valiant Banquo walk\u2019d too late; Whom, you may say, if\u2019t please you, Fleance kill\u2019d, For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? damned fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight, In pious rage, the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; For \u2019twould have anger\u2019d any heart alive, To hear the men deny\u2019t. So that, I say, He has borne all things well: and I do think, That had he Duncan\u2019s sons under his key (As, and\u2019t please heaven, he shall not) they should find What \u2019twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. But, peace!\u2014for from broad words, and \u2019cause he fail\u2019d His presence at the tyrant\u2019s feast, I hear, Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell Where he bestows himself? LORD. The son of Duncan, From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, Lives in the English court and is receiv\u2019d Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward That, by the help of these (with Him above To ratify the work), we may again Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights; Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives, Do faithful homage, and receive free honours, All which we pine for now. And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war. LENNOX. Sent he to Macduff? LORD. He did: and with an absolute \u201cSir, not I,\u201d The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say, \u201cYou\u2019ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.\u201d LENNOX. And that well might Advise him to a caution, t\u2019 hold what distance His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel Fly to the court of England, and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accurs\u2019d! LORD. I\u2019ll send my prayers with him. [_Exeunt._] ACT IV SCENE I. A dark Cave. In the middle, a Cauldron Boiling. Thunder. Enter the three Witches. FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew\u2019d. SECOND WITCH. Thrice, and once the hedge pig whin\u2019d. THIRD WITCH. Harpier cries:\u2014\u2019Tis time, \u2019tis time. FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go; In the poison\u2019d entrails throw.\u2014 Toad, that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty one Swelter\u2019d venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i\u2019 th\u2019 charmed pot! ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble. SECOND WITCH. Fillet of a fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake; Eye of newt, and toe of frog, Wool of bat, and tongue of dog, Adder\u2019s fork, and blind worm\u2019s sting, Lizard\u2019s leg, and howlet\u2019s wing, For a charm of powerful trouble, Like a hell broth boil and bubble. ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble. THIRD WITCH. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witch\u2019s mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravin\u2019d salt sea shark, Root of hemlock digg\u2019d i\u2019 th\u2019 dark, Liver of blaspheming Jew, Gall of goat, and slips of yew Sliver\u2019d in the moon\u2019s eclipse, Nose of Turk, and Tartar\u2019s lips, Finger of birth strangled babe Ditch deliver\u2019d by a drab, Make the gruel thick and slab: Add thereto a tiger\u2019s chaudron, For th\u2019 ingredients of our cauldron. ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble. SECOND WITCH. Cool it with a baboon\u2019s blood. Then the charm is firm and good. Enter Hecate. HECATE. O, well done! I commend your pains, And everyone shall share i\u2019 th\u2019 gains. And now about the cauldron sing, Like elves and fairies in a ring, Enchanting all that you put in. [_Music and a song: \u201cBlack Spirits,\u201d &c._] [_Exit Hecate._] SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. Open, locks, Whoever knocks! Enter Macbeth. MACBETH. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags! What is\u2019t you do? ALL. A deed without a name. MACBETH. I conjure you, by that which you profess, (Howe\u2019er you come to know it) answer me: Though you untie the winds, and let them fight Against the churches; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up; Though bladed corn be lodg\u2019d, and trees blown down; Though castles topple on their warders\u2019 heads; Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure Of nature\u2019s germens tumble all together, Even till destruction sicken, answer me To what I ask you. FIRST WITCH. Speak. SECOND WITCH. Demand. THIRD WITCH. We\u2019ll answer. FIRST WITCH. Say, if thou\u2019dst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters? MACBETH. Call \u2019em, let me see \u2019em. FIRST WITCH. Pour in sow\u2019s blood, that hath eaten Her nine farrow; grease that\u2019s sweaten From the murderer\u2019s gibbet throw Into the flame. ALL. Come, high or low; Thyself and office deftly show! [_Thunder. An Apparition of an armed Head rises._] MACBETH. Tell me, thou unknown power,\u2014 FIRST WITCH. He knows thy thought: Hear his speech, but say thou naught. APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff; Beware the Thane of Fife.\u2014Dismiss me.\u2014Enough. [_Descends._] MACBETH. Whate\u2019er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks; Thou hast harp\u2019d my fear aright.\u2014But one word more. FIRST WITCH. He will not be commanded. Here\u2019s another, More potent than the first. [_Thunder. An Apparition of a bloody Child rises._] APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! MACBETH. Had I three ears, I\u2019d hear thee. APPARITION. Be bloody, bold, and resolute. Laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth. [_Descends._] MACBETH. Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee? But yet I\u2019ll make assurance double sure, And take a bond of fate. Thou shalt not live; That I may tell pale hearted fear it lies, And sleep in spite of thunder. [_Thunder. An Apparition of a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand, rises._] What is this, That rises like the issue of a king, And wears upon his baby brow the round And top of sovereignty? ALL. Listen, but speak not to\u2019t. APPARITION. Be lion mettled, proud, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are: Macbeth shall never vanquish\u2019d be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him. [_Descends._] MACBETH. That will never be: Who can impress the forest; bid the tree Unfix his earth bound root? Sweet bodements, good! Rebellious head, rise never till the wood Of Birnam rise, and our high plac\u2019d Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath To time and mortal custom.\u2014Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art Can tell so much, shall Banquo\u2019s issue ever Reign in this kingdom? ALL. Seek to know no more. MACBETH. I will be satisfied: deny me this, And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know. Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this? [_Hautboys._] FIRST WITCH. Show! SECOND WITCH. Show! THIRD WITCH. Show! ALL. Show his eyes, and grieve his heart; Come like shadows, so depart! [_A show of eight kings appear, and pass over in order, the last with a glass in his hand; Banquo following._] MACBETH. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo. Down! Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs:\u2014and thy hair, Thou other gold bound brow, is like the first. A third is like the former.\u2014Filthy hags! Why do you show me this?\u2014A fourth!\u2014Start, eyes! What, will the line stretch out to th\u2019 crack of doom? Another yet!\u2014A seventh!\u2014I\u2019ll see no more:\u2014 And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass Which shows me many more; and some I see That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry. Horrible sight!\u2014Now I see \u2019tis true; For the blood bolter\u2019d Banquo smiles upon me, And points at them for his.\u2014What! is this so? FIRST WITCH. Ay, sir, all this is so:\u2014but why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?\u2014 Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites, And show the best of our delights. I\u2019ll charm the air to give a sound, While you perform your antic round; That this great king may kindly say, Our duties did his welcome pay. [_Music. The Witches dance, and vanish._] MACBETH. Where are they? Gone?\u2014Let this pernicious hour Stand aye accursed in the calendar!\u2014 Come in, without there! Enter Lennox. LENNOX. What\u2019s your Grace\u2019s will? MACBETH. Saw you the Weird Sisters? LENNOX. No, my lord. MACBETH. Came they not by you? LENNOX. No, indeed, my lord. MACBETH. Infected be the air whereon they ride; And damn\u2019d all those that trust them!\u2014I did hear The galloping of horse: who was\u2019t came by? LENNOX. \u2019Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word Macduff is fled to England. MACBETH. Fled to England! LENNOX. Ay, my good lord. MACBETH. Time, thou anticipat\u2019st my dread exploits: The flighty purpose never is o\u2019ertook Unless the deed go with it. From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand. And even now, To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done: The castle of Macduff I will surprise; Seize upon Fife; give to th\u2019 edge o\u2019 th\u2019 sword His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool; This deed I\u2019ll do before this purpose cool: But no more sights!\u2014Where are these gentlemen? Come, bring me where they are. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. Fife. A Room in Macduff\u2019s Castle. Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross. LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land? ROSS. You must have patience, madam. LADY MACDUFF. He had none: His flight was madness: when our actions do not, Our fears do make us traitors. ROSS. You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear. LADY MACDUFF. Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes, His mansion, and his titles, in a place From whence himself does fly? He loves us not: He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, The most diminutive of birds, will fight, Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. All is the fear, and nothing is the love; As little is the wisdom, where the flight So runs against all reason. ROSS. My dearest coz, I pray you, school yourself: but, for your husband, He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows The fits o\u2019 th\u2019 season. I dare not speak much further: But cruel are the times, when we are traitors, And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumour From what we fear, yet know not what we fear, But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move\u2014I take my leave of you: Shall not be long but I\u2019ll be here again. Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward To what they were before.\u2014My pretty cousin, Blessing upon you! LADY MACDUFF. Father\u2019d he is, and yet he\u2019s fatherless. ROSS. I am so much a fool, should I stay longer, It would be my disgrace and your discomfort: I take my leave at once. [_Exit._] LADY MACDUFF. Sirrah, your father\u2019s dead. And what will you do now? How will you live? SON. As birds do, mother. LADY MACDUFF. What, with worms and flies? SON. With what I get, I mean; and so do they. LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! thou\u2019dst never fear the net nor lime, The pit fall nor the gin. SON. Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for. My father is not dead, for all your saying. LADY MACDUFF. Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father? SON. Nay, how will you do for a husband? LADY MACDUFF. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market. SON. Then you\u2019ll buy \u2019em to sell again. LADY MACDUFF. Thou speak\u2019st with all thy wit; And yet, i\u2019 faith, with wit enough for thee. SON. Was my father a traitor, mother? LADY MACDUFF. Ay, that he was. SON. What is a traitor? LADY MACDUFF. Why, one that swears and lies. SON. And be all traitors that do so? LADY MACDUFF. Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged. SON. And must they all be hanged that swear and lie? LADY MACDUFF. Every one. SON. Who must hang them? LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men. SON. Then the liars and swearers are fools: for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them. LADY MACDUFF. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father? SON. If he were dead, you\u2019ld weep for him: if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father. LADY MACDUFF. Poor prattler, how thou talk\u2019st! Enter a Messenger. MESSENGER. Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known, Though in your state of honour I am perfect. I doubt some danger does approach you nearly: If you will take a homely man\u2019s advice, Be not found here; hence, with your little ones. To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage; To do worse to you were fell cruelty, Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! I dare abide no longer. [_Exit._] LADY MACDUFF. Whither should I fly? I have done no harm. But I remember now I am in this earthly world, where to do harm Is often laudable; to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas, Do I put up that womanly defence, To say I have done no harm? What are these faces? Enter Murderers. FIRST MURDERER. Where is your husband? LADY MACDUFF. I hope, in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him. FIRST MURDERER. He\u2019s a traitor. SON. Thou liest, thou shag ear\u2019d villain! FIRST MURDERER. What, you egg! [_Stabbing him._] Young fry of treachery! SON. He has kill\u2019d me, mother: Run away, I pray you! [_Dies. Exit Lady Macduff, crying \u201cMurder!\u201d and pursued by the Murderers._] SCENE III. England. Before the King\u2019s Palace. Enter Malcolm and Macduff. MALCOLM. Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty. MACDUFF. Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men, Bestride our down fall\u2019n birthdom. Each new morn New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland, and yell\u2019d out Like syllable of dolour. MALCOLM. What I believe, I\u2019ll wail; What know, believe; and what I can redress, As I shall find the time to friend, I will. What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance. This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues, Was once thought honest: you have loved him well; He hath not touch\u2019d you yet. I am young; but something You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb To appease an angry god. MACDUFF. I am not treacherous. MALCOLM. But Macbeth is. A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon. That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose. Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell: Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, Yet grace must still look so. MACDUFF. I have lost my hopes. MALCOLM. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts. Why in that rawness left you wife and child, Those precious motives, those strong knots of love, Without leave taking?\u2014I pray you, Let not my jealousies be your dishonours, But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just, Whatever I shall think. MACDUFF. Bleed, bleed, poor country! Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs; The title is affeer\u2019d.\u2014Fare thee well, lord: I would not be the villain that thou think\u2019st For the whole space that\u2019s in the tyrant\u2019s grasp And the rich East to boot. MALCOLM. Be not offended: I speak not as in absolute fear of you. I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds. I think, withal, There would be hands uplifted in my right; And here, from gracious England, have I offer Of goodly thousands: but, for all this, When I shall tread upon the tyrant\u2019s head, Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before, More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever, By him that shall succeed. MACDUFF. What should he be? MALCOLM. It is myself I mean; in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That, when they shall be open\u2019d, black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb, being compar\u2019d With my confineless harms. MACDUFF. Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn\u2019d In evils to top Macbeth. MALCOLM. I grant him bloody, Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin That has a name: but there\u2019s no bottom, none, In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters, Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up The cistern of my lust; and my desire All continent impediments would o\u2019erbear, That did oppose my will: better Macbeth Than such an one to reign. MACDUFF. Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny; it hath been Th\u2019 untimely emptying of the happy throne, And fall of many kings. But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours: you may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty, And yet seem cold\u2014the time you may so hoodwink. We have willing dames enough; there cannot be That vulture in you, to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves, Finding it so inclin\u2019d. MALCOLM. With this there grows In my most ill compos\u2019d affection such A staunchless avarice, that, were I king, I should cut off the nobles for their lands; Desire his jewels, and this other\u2019s house: And my more having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more; that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, Destroying them for wealth. MACDUFF. This avarice Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root Than summer seeming lust; and it hath been The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear; Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will, Of your mere own. All these are portable, With other graces weigh\u2019d. MALCOLM. But I have none: the king becoming graces, As justice, verity, temp\u2019rance, stableness, Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness, Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude, I have no relish of them; but abound In the division of each several crime, Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, Uproar the universal peace, confound All unity on earth. MACDUFF. O Scotland, Scotland! MALCOLM. If such a one be fit to govern, speak: I am as I have spoken. MACDUFF. Fit to govern? No, not to live.\u2014O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant bloody scepter\u2019d, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again, Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accus\u2019d, And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee, Oft\u2019ner upon her knees than on her feet, Died every day she lived. Fare thee well! These evils thou repeat\u2019st upon thyself Have banish\u2019d me from Scotland.\u2014O my breast, Thy hope ends here! MALCOLM. Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconcil\u2019d my thoughts To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me From over credulous haste: but God above Deal between thee and me! for even now I put myself to thy direction, and Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself, For strangers to my nature. I am yet Unknown to woman; never was forsworn; Scarcely have coveted what was mine own; At no time broke my faith; would not betray The devil to his fellow; and delight No less in truth than life: my first false speaking Was this upon myself. What I am truly, Is thine and my poor country\u2019s to command: Whither, indeed, before thy here approach, Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men, Already at a point, was setting forth. Now we\u2019ll together, and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent? MACDUFF. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once \u2019Tis hard to reconcile. Enter a Doctor. MALCOLM. Well; more anon.\u2014Comes the King forth, I pray you? DOCTOR. Ay, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure: their malady convinces The great assay of art; but at his touch, Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand, They presently amend. MALCOLM. I thank you, doctor. [_Exit Doctor._] MACDUFF. What\u2019s the disease he means? MALCOLM. \u2019Tis call\u2019d the evil: A most miraculous work in this good king; Which often, since my here remain in England, I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven, Himself best knows, but strangely visited people, All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he cures; Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, Put on with holy prayers: and \u2019tis spoken, To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction. With this strange virtue, He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy; And sundry blessings hang about his throne, That speak him full of grace. Enter Ross. MACDUFF. See, who comes here? MALCOLM. My countryman; but yet I know him not. MACDUFF. My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither. MALCOLM. I know him now. Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers! ROSS. Sir, amen. MACDUFF. Stands Scotland where it did? ROSS. Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot Be call\u2019d our mother, but our grave, where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air, Are made, not mark\u2019d; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy. The dead man\u2019s knell Is there scarce ask\u2019d for who; and good men\u2019s lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying or ere they sicken. MACDUFF. O, relation Too nice, and yet too true! MALCOLM. What\u2019s the newest grief? ROSS. That of an hour\u2019s age doth hiss the speaker; Each minute teems a new one. MACDUFF. How does my wife? ROSS. Why, well. MACDUFF. And all my children? ROSS. Well too. MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter\u2019d at their peace? ROSS. No; they were well at peace when I did leave \u2019em. MACDUFF. Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes\u2019t? ROSS. When I came hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour Of many worthy fellows that were out; Which was to my belief witness\u2019d the rather, For that I saw the tyrant\u2019s power afoot. Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, make our women fight, To doff their dire distresses. MALCOLM. Be\u2019t their comfort We are coming thither. Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men; An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out. ROSS. Would I could answer This comfort with the like! But I have words That would be howl\u2019d out in the desert air, Where hearing should not latch them. MACDUFF. What concern they? The general cause? or is it a fee grief Due to some single breast? ROSS. No mind that\u2019s honest But in it shares some woe, though the main part Pertains to you alone. MACDUFF. If it be mine, Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it. ROSS. Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard. MACDUFF. Humh! I guess at it. ROSS. Your castle is surpris\u2019d; your wife and babes Savagely slaughter\u2019d. To relate the manner Were, on the quarry of these murder\u2019d deer, To add the death of you. MALCOLM. Merciful heaven!\u2014 What, man! ne\u2019er pull your hat upon your brows. Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak Whispers the o\u2019er fraught heart, and bids it break. MACDUFF. My children too? ROSS. Wife, children, servants, all That could be found. MACDUFF. And I must be from thence! My wife kill\u2019d too? ROSS. I have said. MALCOLM. Be comforted: Let\u2019s make us med\u2019cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief. MACDUFF. He has no children.\u2014All my pretty ones? Did you say all?\u2014O hell kite!\u2014All? What, all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop? MALCOLM. Dispute it like a man. MACDUFF. I shall do so; But I must also feel it as a man: I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me.\u2014Did heaven look on, And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now! MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. MACDUFF. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes, And braggart with my tongue!\u2014But, gentle heavens, Cut short all intermission; front to front, Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my sword\u2019s length set him; if he \u2019scape, Heaven forgive him too! MALCOLM. This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready; Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may; The night is long that never finds the day. [_Exeunt._] ACT V SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle. Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman. DOCTOR. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked? GENTLEWOMAN. Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon\u2019t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep. DOCTOR. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say? GENTLEWOMAN. That, sir, which I will not report after her. DOCTOR. You may to me; and \u2019tis most meet you should. GENTLEWOMAN. Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech. Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper. Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close. DOCTOR. How came she by that light? GENTLEWOMAN. Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; \u2019tis her command. DOCTOR. You see, her eyes are open. GENTLEWOMAN. Ay, but their sense are shut. DOCTOR. What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands. GENTLEWOMAN. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. LADY MACBETH. Yet here\u2019s a spot. DOCTOR. Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly. LADY MACBETH. Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then \u2019tis time to do\u2019t. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? DOCTOR. Do you mark that? LADY MACBETH. The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?\u2014What, will these hands ne\u2019er be clean? No more o\u2019 that, my lord, no more o\u2019 that: you mar all with this starting. DOCTOR. Go to, go to. You have known what you should not. GENTLEWOMAN. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has known. LADY MACBETH. Here\u2019s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh! DOCTOR. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged. GENTLEWOMAN. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body. DOCTOR. Well, well, well. GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir. DOCTOR. This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep, who have died holily in their beds. LADY MACBETH. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo\u2019s buried; he cannot come out on\u2019s grave. DOCTOR. Even so? LADY MACBETH. To bed, to bed. There\u2019s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What\u2019s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed. [_Exit._] DOCTOR. Will she go now to bed? GENTLEWOMAN. Directly. DOCTOR. Foul whisp\u2019rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets. More needs she the divine than the physician.\u2014 God, God, forgive us all! Look after her; Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night: My mind she has mated, and amaz\u2019d my sight. I think, but dare not speak. GENTLEWOMAN. Good night, good doctor. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane. Enter, with drum and colours Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox and Soldiers. MENTEITH. The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff. Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man. ANGUS. Near Birnam wood Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming. CAITHNESS. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? LENNOX. For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file Of all the gentry: there is Siward\u2019s son And many unrough youths, that even now Protest their first of manhood. MENTEITH. What does the tyrant? CAITHNESS. Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies. Some say he\u2019s mad; others, that lesser hate him, Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, He cannot buckle his distemper\u2019d cause Within the belt of rule. ANGUS. Now does he feel His secret murders sticking on his hands; Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach; Those he commands move only in command, Nothing in love: now does he feel his title Hang loose about him, like a giant\u2019s robe Upon a dwarfish thief. MENTEITH. Who, then, shall blame His pester\u2019d senses to recoil and start, When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there? CAITHNESS. Well, march we on, To give obedience where \u2019tis truly ow\u2019d: Meet we the med\u2019cine of the sickly weal; And with him pour we, in our country\u2019s purge, Each drop of us. LENNOX. Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds. Make we our march towards Birnam. [_Exeunt, marching._] SCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle. Enter Macbeth, Doctor and Attendants. MACBETH. Bring me no more reports; let them fly all: Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane I cannot taint with fear. What\u2019s the boy Malcolm? Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounc\u2019d me thus: \u201cFear not, Macbeth; no man that\u2019s born of woman Shall e\u2019er have power upon thee.\u201d\u2014Then fly, false thanes, And mingle with the English epicures: The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear, Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. Enter a Servant. The devil damn thee black, thou cream fac\u2019d loon! Where gott\u2019st thou that goose look? SERVANT. There is ten thousand\u2014 MACBETH. Geese, villain? SERVANT. Soldiers, sir. MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over red thy fear, Thou lily liver\u2019d boy. What soldiers, patch? Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey face? SERVANT. The English force, so please you. MACBETH. Take thy face hence. [_Exit Servant._] Seyton!\u2014I am sick at heart, When I behold\u2014Seyton, I say!\u2014This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now. I have liv\u2019d long enough: my way of life Is fall\u2019n into the sere, the yellow leaf; And that which should accompany old age, As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends, I must not look to have; but, in their stead, Curses, not loud but deep, mouth honour, breath, Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!\u2014 Enter Seyton. SEYTON. What\u2019s your gracious pleasure? MACBETH. What news more? SEYTON. All is confirm\u2019d, my lord, which was reported. MACBETH. I\u2019ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack\u2019d. Give me my armour. SEYTON. \u2019Tis not needed yet. MACBETH. I\u2019ll put it on. Send out more horses, skirr the country round; Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.\u2014 How does your patient, doctor? DOCTOR. Not so sick, my lord, As she is troubled with thick coming fancies, That keep her from her rest. MACBETH. Cure her of that: Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas\u2019d, Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, Raze out the written troubles of the brain, And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuff\u2019d bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart? DOCTOR. Therein the patient Must minister to himself. MACBETH. Throw physic to the dogs, I\u2019ll none of it. Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff: Seyton, send out.\u2014Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.\u2014 Come, sir, despatch.\u2014If thou couldst, doctor, cast The water of my land, find her disease, And purge it to a sound and pristine health, I would applaud thee to the very echo, That should applaud again.\u2014Pull\u2019t off, I say.\u2014 What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug, Would scour these English hence? Hear\u2019st thou of them? DOCTOR. Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation Makes us hear something. MACBETH. Bring it after me.\u2014 I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane. [_Exeunt all except Doctor._] DOCTOR. Were I from Dunsinane away and clear, Profit again should hardly draw me here. [_Exit._] SCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view. Enter, with drum and colours Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross and Soldiers, marching. MALCOLM. Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe. MENTEITH. We doubt it nothing. SIWARD. What wood is this before us? MENTEITH. The wood of Birnam. MALCOLM. Let every soldier hew him down a bough, And bear\u2019t before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us. SOLDIERS. It shall be done. SIWARD. We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before\u2019t. MALCOLM. \u2019Tis his main hope; For where there is advantage to be given, Both more and less have given him the revolt, And none serve with him but constrained things, Whose hearts are absent too. MACDUFF. Let our just censures Attend the true event, and put we on Industrious soldiership. SIWARD. The time approaches, That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have, and what we owe. Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, But certain issue strokes must arbitrate; Towards which advance the war. [_Exeunt, marching._] SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle. Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton and Soldiers. MACBETH. Hang out our banners on the outward walls; The cry is still, \u201cThey come!\u201d Our castle\u2019s strength Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up. Were they not forc\u2019d with those that should be ours, We might have met them dareful, beard to beard, And beat them backward home. [_A cry of women within._] What is that noise? SEYTON. It is the cry of women, my good lord. [_Exit._] MACBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears. The time has been, my senses would have cool\u2019d To hear a night shriek; and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in\u2019t. I have supp\u2019d full with horrors; Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts, Cannot once start me. Enter Seyton. Wherefore was that cry? SEYTON. The Queen, my lord, is dead. MACBETH. She should have died hereafter. There would have been a time for such a word. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life\u2019s but a walking shadow; a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more: it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. Enter a Messenger. Thou com\u2019st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. MESSENGER. Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do\u2019t. MACBETH. Well, say, sir. MESSENGER. As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I look\u2019d toward Birnam, and anon, methought, The wood began to move. MACBETH. Liar, and slave! MESSENGER. Let me endure your wrath, if\u2019t be not so. Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove. MACBETH. If thou speak\u2019st false, Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.\u2014 I pull in resolution; and begin To doubt th\u2019 equivocation of the fiend, That lies like truth. \u201cFear not, till Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane;\u201d and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane.\u2014Arm, arm, and out!\u2014 If this which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here. I \u2019gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th\u2019 estate o\u2019 th\u2019 world were now undone.\u2014 Ring the alarum bell!\u2014Blow, wind! come, wrack! At least we\u2019ll die with harness on our back. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff and their Army, with boughs. MALCOLM. Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down, And show like those you are.\u2014You, worthy uncle, Shall with my cousin, your right noble son, Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon\u2019s what else remains to do, According to our order. SIWARD. Fare you well.\u2014 Do we but find the tyrant\u2019s power tonight, Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight. MACDUFF. Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath, Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death. [_Exeunt._] SCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain. Alarums. Enter Macbeth. MACBETH. They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly, But, bear like I must fight the course.\u2014What\u2019s he That was not born of woman? Such a one Am I to fear, or none. Enter young Siward. YOUNG SIWARD. What is thy name? MACBETH. Thou\u2019lt be afraid to hear it. YOUNG SIWARD. No; though thou call\u2019st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell. MACBETH. My name\u2019s Macbeth. YOUNG SIWARD. The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear. MACBETH. No, nor more fearful. YOUNG SIWARD. Thou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword I\u2019ll prove the lie thou speak\u2019st. [_They fight, and young Siward is slain._] MACBETH. Thou wast born of woman. But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, Brandish\u2019d by man that\u2019s of a woman born. [_Exit._] Alarums. Enter Macduff. MACDUFF. That way the noise is.\u2014Tyrant, show thy face! If thou be\u2019st slain and with no stroke of mine, My wife and children\u2019s ghosts will haunt me still. I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth, Or else my sword, with an unbatter\u2019d edge, I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be; By this great clatter, one of greatest note Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune! And more I beg not. [_Exit. Alarums._] Enter Malcolm and old Siward. SIWARD. This way, my lord;\u2014the castle\u2019s gently render\u2019d: The tyrant\u2019s people on both sides do fight; The noble thanes do bravely in the war, The day almost itself professes yours, And little is to do. MALCOLM. We have met with foes That strike beside us. SIWARD. Enter, sir, the castle. [_Exeunt. Alarums._] SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field. Enter Macbeth. MACBETH. Why should I play the Roman fool, and die On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes Do better upon them. Enter Macduff. MACDUFF. Turn, hell hound, turn! MACBETH. Of all men else I have avoided thee: But get thee back; my soul is too much charg\u2019d With blood of thine already. MACDUFF. I have no words; My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out! [_They fight._] MACBETH. Thou losest labour: As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed: Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; I bear a charmed life, which must not yield To one of woman born. MACDUFF. Despair thy charm; And let the angel whom thou still hast serv\u2019d Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\u2019s womb Untimely ripp\u2019d. MACBETH. Accursed be that tongue that tells me so, For it hath cow\u2019d my better part of man! And be these juggling fiends no more believ\u2019d, That palter with us in a double sense; That keep the word of promise to our ear, And break it to our hope!\u2014I\u2019ll not fight with thee. MACDUFF. Then yield thee, coward, And live to be the show and gaze o\u2019 th\u2019 time. We\u2019ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are, Painted upon a pole, and underwrit, \u201cHere may you see the tyrant.\u201d MACBETH. I will not yield, To kiss the ground before young Malcolm\u2019s feet, And to be baited with the rabble\u2019s curse. Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane, And thou oppos\u2019d, being of no woman born, Yet I will try the last. Before my body I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff; And damn\u2019d be him that first cries, \u201cHold, enough!\u201d [_Exeunt fighting. Alarums._] Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Ross, Thanes and Soldiers. MALCOLM. I would the friends we miss were safe arriv\u2019d. SIWARD. Some must go off; and yet, by these I see, So great a day as this is cheaply bought. MALCOLM. Macduff is missing, and your noble son. ROSS. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier\u2019s debt: He only liv\u2019d but till he was a man; The which no sooner had his prowess confirm\u2019d In the unshrinking station where he fought, But like a man he died. SIWARD. Then he is dead? ROSS. Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow Must not be measur\u2019d by his worth, for then It hath no end. SIWARD. Had he his hurts before? ROSS. Ay, on the front. SIWARD. Why then, God\u2019s soldier be he! Had I as many sons as I have hairs, I would not wish them to a fairer death: And so his knell is knoll\u2019d. MALCOLM. He\u2019s worth more sorrow, And that I\u2019ll spend for him. SIWARD. He\u2019s worth no more. They say he parted well and paid his score: And so, God be with him!\u2014Here comes newer comfort. Enter Macduff with Macbeth\u2019s head. MACDUFF. Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold, where stands Th\u2019 usurper\u2019s cursed head: the time is free. I see thee compass\u2019d with thy kingdom\u2019s pearl, That speak my salutation in their minds; Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,\u2014 Hail, King of Scotland! ALL. Hail, King of Scotland! [_Flourish._] MALCOLM. We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves, And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honour nam\u2019d. What\u2019s more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time,\u2014 As calling home our exil\u2019d friends abroad, That fled the snares of watchful tyranny; Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher, and his fiend like queen, Who, as \u2019tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life;\u2014this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place. So thanks to all at once, and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crown\u2019d at Scone. [_Flourish. Exeunt._] ",

It cannot Be call\u2019d our mother, but our grave, where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks, that rent the air, Are made, not mark\u2019d; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy.",
