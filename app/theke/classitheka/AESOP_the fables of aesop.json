Almost all the fables that have appeared in the Western world have been sheltered at one time or another under the shadow of that name. I could at any rate enumerate at least seven hundred which have appeared in English in various books entitled _\u00c6sop\u2019s Fables_. L\u2019Estrange\u2019s collection alone contains over five hundred. In the struggle for existence among all these a certain number stand out as being the most effective and the most familiar. I have attempted to bring most of these into the following pages. There is no fixed text even for the nucleus collection contained in this book. \u00c6sop himself is so shadowy a figure that we might almost be forgiven if we held, with regard to him, the heresy of Mistress Elizabeth Prig. What we call his fables can in most cases be traced back to the fables of other people, notably of Ph\u00e6drus and Babrius. It is usual to regard the Greek Prose Collections, passing under the name of \u00c6sop, as having greater claims to the eponymous title; but modern research has shown that these are but medieval prosings of Babrius\u2019s verse. I have therefore felt at liberty to retell the fables in such a way as would interest children, and have adopted from the various versions that which seemed most suitable in each case, telling the fable anew in my own way. Much has been learnt during the present century about the history of the various apologues that walk abroad under the name of \u201c\u00c6sop.\u201d I have attempted to bring these various lines of research together in the somewhat elaborate introductory volume which I wrote to accompany my edition of Caxton\u2019s _\u00c6sop_, published by Mr. Nutt in his _Biblioth\u00e8que de Carabas_. I have placed in front of the present version of the \u201cFables,\u201d by kind permission of Mr. Nutt, the short abstract of my researches in which I there summed up the results of that volume. I must accompany it, here as there, by a warning to the reader, that for a large proportion of the results thus reached I am myself responsible; but I am happy to say that many of them have been accepted by the experts in America, France, and Germany, who have done me the honour to consider my researches. Here, in England, there does not seem to be much interest in this class of work, and English scholars, for the most part, are content to remain in ignorance of the methods and results of literary history. I have attached to the \u201cFables\u201d in the obscurity of small print at the end a series of notes, summing up what is known as to the _provenance_ of each fable. Here, again, I have tried to put in shorter and more readable form the results of my researches in the volume to which I have already referred. For more detailed information I must refer to the forty closely printed pages (vol. i. pp. 225 268) which contain the bibliography of the Fables. JOSEPH JACOBS. A SHORT HISTORY OF THE \u00c6SOPIC FABLE Most nations develop the Beast Tale as part of their folk lore, some go further and apply it to satiric purposes, and a few nations afford isolated examples of the shaping of the Beast Tale to teach some moral truth by means of the Fable properly so called.[1] But only two peoples independently made this a general practice. Both in Greece[2] and in India we find in the earliest literature such casual and frequent mention of Fables as seems to imply a body of Folk Fables current among the people. And in both countries special circumstances raised the Fable from folklore into literature. In Greece, during the epoch of the Tyrants, when free speech was dangerous, the Fable was largely used for political purposes. The inventor of this application or the most prominent user of it was one \u00c6sop, a slave at Samos whose name has ever since been connected with the Fable. All that we know about him is contained in a few lines of Herodotus: that he flourished 550 B.C.; was killed in accordance with a Delphian oracle; and that _wergild_ was claimed for him by the grandson of his master, Iadmon. When free speech was established in the Greek democracies, the custom of using Fables in harangues was continued and encouraged by the rhetoricians, while the mirth producing qualities of the Fable caused it to be regarded as fit subject of after dinner conversation along with other jests of a broader kind (\u201cMilesian,\u201d \u201cSybaritic\u201d). This habit of regarding the Fable as a form of the Jest intensified the tendency to connect it with a well known name as in the case of our Joe Miller. About 300 B.C. Demetrius Phalereus, whilom tyrant of Athens and founder of the Alexandria Library, collected together all the Fables he could find under the title of _Assemblies of \u00c6sopic Tales_ (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u1f30\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9). This collection, running probably to some 200 Fables, after being interpolated and edited by the Alexandrine grammarians, was turned into neat Latin iambics by Ph\u00e6drus, a Greek freedman of Augustus in the early years of the Christian era. As the modern \u00c6sop is mainly derived from Ph\u00e6drus, the answer to the question \u201cWho wrote \u00c6sop?\u201d is simple : \u201cDemetrius of Phaleron.\u201d[3] [1] _E.g._ Jotham\u2019s Fable, Judges ix., and that of Menenius Agrippa in Livy, seem to be quite independent of either Greek or Indian influence. But one fable does not make Fable. [2] Only about twenty fables, however, are known in Greece before Ph\u00e6drus, 30 A.D. See my Caxton\u2019s _\u00c6sop_ vol. i. pp. 26\u201329, for a complete enumeration. [3] For this statement and what follows a reference to the Pedigree of the Fables on p. 196 will be found useful. In India the great ethical reformer, Sakyamuni, the Buddha, initiated (or adopted from the Brahmins) the habit of using the Beast Tale for moral purposes, or, in other words, transformed it into the Fable proper. A collection of these seems to have existed previously and independently, in which the Fables were associated with the name of a mythical sage, Kasy\u00e2pa. These were appropriated by the early Buddhists by the simple expedient of making Kasy\u00e2pa the immediately preceding incarnation of the Buddha. A number of his _itih\u00e2sas_ or Tales were included in the sacred Buddhistic work containing the _J\u0101takas_ or previous births of the Buddha, in some of which the Bodisat (or future Buddha) appears as one of the Dramatis Person\u00e6 of the Fables; the Crane, _e.g._, in our _Wolf and Crane_ being one of the incarnations of the Buddha. So, too, the Lamb of our _Wolf and Lamb_ was once Buddha; it was therefore easy for him\u2014so the Buddhists thought\u2014to remember and tell these Fables as incidents of his former careers. It is obvious that the whole idea of a Fable as an anecdote about a man masquerading in the form of a beast could most easily arise and gain currency where the theory of transmigration was vividly credited. The Fables of Kasy\u00e2pa, or rather the moral verses (_gathas_) which served as a _memoria technica_ to them, were probably carried over to Ceylon in 241 B.C. along with the J\u0101takas. About 300 years later (say 50 A.D.) some 100 of these were brought by a Cingalese embassy to Alexandria, where they were translated under the title of \u201cLibyan Fables\u201d (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 \u039b\u03c5\u03b2\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af), which had been earlier applied to similar stories that had percolated to Hellas from India; they were attributed to \u201cKybises.\u201d This collection seems to have introduced the habit of summing up the teaching of a Fable in the Moral, corresponding to the _gatha_ of the J\u0101takas. About the end of the first century A.D. the Libyan Fables of \u201cKybises\u201d became known to the Rabbinic school at Jabne, founded by R. Jochanan ben Saccai, and a number of the Fables translated into Aramaic which are still extant in the Talmud and Midrash. In the Roman world the two collections of Demetrius and \u201cKybises\u201d were brought together by Nicostratus, a rhetor attached to the court of Marcus Aurelius. In the earlier part of the next century (c. 230 A.D.) this _corpus_ of the ancient fable, \u00c6sopic and Libyan, amounting in all to some 300 members, was done into Greek verse with Latin accentuation (choliambics) by Valerius Babrius, tutor to the young son of Alexander Severus. Still later, towards the end of the fourth century, forty two of these, mainly of the Libyan section, were translated into Latin verse by one Avian, with whom the ancient history of the Fable ends. In the Middle Ages it was naturally the Latin Ph\u00e6drus that represented the \u00c6sopic Fable to the learned world, but Ph\u00e6drus in a fuller form than has descended to us in verse. A selection of some eighty fables was turned into indifferent prose in the ninth century, probably at the Schools of Charles the Great. This was attributed to a fictitious Romulus. Another prose collection by Ademar of Chabannes was made before 1030, and still preserves some of the lines of the lost Fables of Ph\u00e6drus. The Fables became especially popular among the Normans. A number of them occur on the Bayeux Tapestry, and in the twelfth century England, the head of the Angevin empire, became the home of the Fable, all the important adaptations and versions of \u00c6sop being made in this country. One of these done into Latin verse by Walter the Englishman became the standard \u00c6sop of medieval Christendom. The same history applies in large measure to the Fables of Avian, which were done into prose, transferred back into Latin verse, and sent forth through Europe from England. Meanwhile Babrius had been suffering the same fate as Ph\u00e6drus. His scazons were turned into poor Greek prose, and selections of them pass to this day as the original Fables of \u00c6sop. Some fifty of these were selected, and with the addition of a dozen Oriental fables, were attributed to an imaginary Persian sage, Syntipas; this collection was translated into Syriac, and thence into Arabic, where they passed under the name of the legendary L\u00f4qman (probably a doublet of Balaam). A still larger collection of the Greek prose versions got into Arabic, where it was enriched by some 60 fables from the Arabic Bidpai and other sources, but still passed under the name of \u00c6sop. This collection, containing 164 fables, was brought to England after the Third Crusade of Richard I., and translated into Latin by an Englishman named Alfred, with the aid of an Oxford Jew named Berachyah ha Nakdan (\u201cBenedictus le Puncteur\u201d in the English Records), who, on his own account, translated a number of the fables into Hebrew rhymed prose, under the Talmudic title _Mishle Shu\u2018alim_ (Fox Fables).[4] Part of Alfred\u2019s \u00c6sop was translated into English alliterative verse, and this again was translated about 1200 into French by Marie de France, who attributed the new fables to King Alfred. After her no important addition was made to the medieval \u00c6sop. [4] I have given specimens of his Fables in my _Jews of Angevin England_, pp. 165\u2013173, 278\u2013281. With the invention of printing the European book of \u00c6sop was compiled about 1480 by Heinrich Stainh\u00f6wel, who put together the Romulus with selections from Avian, some of the Greek prose versions of Babrius from Ranuzio\u2019s translation, and a few from Alfred\u2019s \u00c6sop. To these he added the legendary life of \u00c6sop and a selection of somewhat loose tales from Petrus Alphonsi and Poggio Bracciolini, corresponding to the Milesian and Sybaritic tales which were associated with the Fable in antiquity. Stainh\u00f6wel translated all this into German, and within twenty years his collection had been turned into French, English (by Caxton, in 1484), Italian, Dutch, and Spanish. Additions were made to it by Brandt and Waldis in Germany, by L\u2019Estrange in England, and by La Fontaine in France; these were chiefly from the larger Greek collections published after Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s day, and, in the case of La Fontaine, from Bidpai and other Oriental sources. But these additions have rarely taken hold, and the \u00c6sop of modern Europe is in large measure Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s, even to the present day. The first three quarters of the present collection are Stainh\u00f6wel mainly in Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s order. Selections from it passed into spelling and reading books, and made the Fables part of modern European folk lore.[5] [5] An episode in the history of the modern \u00c6sop deserves record, if only to illustrate the law that \u00c6sop always begins his career as a political weapon in a new home. When a selection of the Fables were translated into Chinese in 1840 they became favourite reading with the officials, till a high dignitary said, \u201cThis is clearly directed against _us_,\u201d and ordered \u00c6sop to be included in the Chinese _Index Expurgatorius_ (R. Morris, _Cont. Rev_. xxxix. p. 731). We may conclude this history of \u00c6sop with a similar account of the progress of \u00c6sopic investigation. First came collection; the Greek \u00c6sop was brought together by Neveletus in 1610, the Latin by Nilant in 1709. The main truth about the former was laid down by the master hand of Bentley during a skirmish in the Battle of the Books; the equally great critic Lessing began to unravel the many knotty points connected with the medieval Latin \u00c6sop. His investigations have been carried on and completed by three Frenchmen in the present century, Robert, Du M\u00e9ril, and Hervieux; while three Germans, Crusius, Benfey, and Mall, have thrown much needed light on Babrius, on the Oriental \u00c6sop, and on Marie de France. Lastly, I have myself brought together these various lines of inquiry, and by adding a few threads of my own, have been able to weave them all for the first time into a consistent pattern.[6] [6] _The Fables of \u00c6sop, as first printed by William Caxton in_ 1484, _now again edited and induced by Joseph Jacobs_ (London, 1889), 2 vols., the first containing a History of the \u00c6sopic Fable. So much for the past of the Fable. Has it a future as a mode of literary expression? Scarcely; its method is at once too simple and too roundabout. Too roundabout; for the truths we have to tell we prefer to speak out directly and not by way of allegory. And the truths the Fable has to teach are too simple to correspond to the facts of our complex civilisation; its rude _graffiti_ of human nature cannot reproduce the subtle gradations of modern life. But as we all pass through in our lives the various stages of ancestral culture, there comes a time when these rough sketches of life have their appeal to us as they had for our forefathers. The allegory gives us a pleasing and not too strenuous stimulation of the intellectual powers; the lesson is not too complicated for childlike minds. Indeed, in their grotesque grace, in their quaint humour, in their trust in the simpler virtues, in their insight into the cruder vices, in their innocence of the fact of sex, \u00c6sop\u2019s Fables are as little children. They are as little children, and for that reason they will for ever find a home in the heaven of little children\u2019s souls. Aesop\u2019s Fables The Cock and the Pearl A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shinning amid the straw. \u201cHo! ho!\u201d quoth he, \u201cthat\u2019s for me,\u201d and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. \u201cWhat did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? \u201cYou may be a treasure,\u201d quoth Master Cock, \u201cto men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley corn than a peck of pearls.\u201d Precious things are for those that can prize them. The Wolf and the Lamb Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down. \u201cThere\u2019s my supper,\u201d thought he, \u201cif only I can find some excuse to seize it.\u201d Then he called out to the Lamb, \u201cHow dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?\u201d \u201cNay, master, nay,\u201d said Lambikin; \u201cif the water be muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d said the Wolf, \u201cwhy did you call me bad names this time last year?\u201d \u201cThat cannot be,\u201d said the Lamb; \u201cI am only six months old.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d snarled the Wolf; \u201cif it was not you it was your father;\u201d and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA ate her all up. But before she died she gasped out\u2014 \u201cAny excuse will serve a tyrant.\u201d The Dog and the Shadow It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace. Now on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook. As he crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath. Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have that also. So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more. Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow. The Lion\u2019s Share The Lion went once a hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf. They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag, and soon took its life. Then came the question how the spoil should be divided. \u201cQuarter me this Stag,\u201d roared the Lion; so the other animals skinned it and cut it into four parts. Then the Lion took his stand in front of the carcass and pronounced judgment: The first quarter is for me in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter; another share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the fourth quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of you will dare to lay a paw upon it.\u201d \u201cHumph,\u201d grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail between his legs; but he spoke in a low growl\u2014 \u201cYou may share the labours of the great, but you will not share the spoil.\u201d The Wolf and the Crane A Wolf had been gorging on an animal he had killed, when suddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could not swallow it. He soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and ran up and down groaning and groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain. He tried to induce every one he met to remove the bone. \u201cI would give anything,\u201d said he, \u201cif you would take it out.\u201d At last the Crane agreed to try, and told the Wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws as wide as he could. Then the Crane put its long neck down the Wolf\u2019s throat, and with its beak loosened the bone, till at last it got it out. \u201cWill you kindly give me the reward you promised?\u201d said the Crane. The Wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said: \u201cBe content. You have put your head inside a Wolf\u2019s mouth and taken it out again in safety; that ought to be reward enough for you.\u201d Gratitude and greed go not together. The Man and the Serpent A Countryman\u2019s son by accident trod upon a Serpent\u2019s tail, which turned and bit him so that he died. The father in a rage got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail. So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer\u2019s cattle and caused him severe loss. Well, the Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it: \u201cLet\u2019s forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Serpent; \u201ctake away your gifts; you can never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail.\u201d Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten. The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely. The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and said: \u201cI cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.\u201d No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse\u2019s residence late at night. \u201cYou will want some refreshment after our long journey,\u201d said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining room. There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growling and barking. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d said the Country Mouse. \u201cIt is only the dogs of the house,\u201d answered the other. \u201cOnly!\u201d said the Country Mouse. \u201cI do not like that music at my dinner.\u201d Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off. \u201cGood bye, Cousin,\u201d said the Country Mouse. \u201cWhat! going so soon?\u201d said the other. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied; \u201cBetter beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear.\u201d The Fox and the Crow A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree. \u201cThat\u2019s for me, as I am a Fox,\u201d said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree. \u201cGood day, Mistress Crow,\u201d he cried. \u201cHow well you are looking to day: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.\u201d The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Fox. \u201cThat will do,\u201d said he. \u201cThat was all I wanted. In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future\u2014 \u201cDo not trust flatterers.\u201d The Flatter doth rob by stealth, His victim, both of Wit and Wealth. The Sick Lion A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath. The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless. When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: \u201cNow is the time to pay off old grudges.\u201d So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels into his face. \u201cThis is a double death,\u201d growled the Lion. Only cowards insult dying majesty. The Ass and the Lapdog A Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden: among them was his favourite Ass, that was always well fed and often carried his master. With the Farmer came his Lapdog, who danced about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be. The Farmer felt in his pocket, gave the Lapdog some dainty food, and sat down while he gave his orders to his servants. The Lapdog jumped into his master\u2019s lap, and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears. The Ass, seeing this, broke loose from his halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of the Lapdog. The Farmer could not hold his sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting his feet upon the Farmer\u2019s shoulder attempted to climb into his lap. The Farmer\u2019s servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught the Ass that Clumsy jesting is no joke. The Lion and the Mouse Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him. \u201cPardon, O King,\u201d cried the little Mouse: \u201cforgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?\u201d The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go. Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on. Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts. \u201cWas I not right?\u201d said the little Mouse. Little friends may prove great friends. The Swallow and the Other Birds It happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seeds in a field where a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking up their food. \u201cBeware of that man,\u201d quoth the Swallow. \u201cWhy, what is he doing?\u201d said the others. \u201cThat is hemp seed he is sowing; be careful to pick up every one of the seeds, or else you will repent it.\u201d The birds paid no heed to the Swallow\u2019s words, and by and by the hemp grew up and was made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and many a bird that had despised the Swallow\u2019s advice was caught in nets made out of that very hemp. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d said the Swallow. Destroy the seed of evil, or it will grow up to your ruin. The Frogs Desiring a King The Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that just suited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody troubling with them. But some of them thought that this was not right, that they should have a king and a proper constitution, so they determined to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted. \u201cMighty Jove,\u201d they cried, \u201csend unto us a king that will rule over us and keep us in order.\u201d Jove laughed at their croaking, and threw down into the swamp a huge Log, which came down splashing into the swamp. The Frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two of the boldest of them ventured out towards the Log, and even dared to touch it; still it did not move. Then the greatest hero of the Frogs jumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon it, thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for some time the Frogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest notice of their new King Log lying in their midst. But this did not suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, and said to him, \u201cWe want a real king; one that will really rule over us.\u201d Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big Stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up. Then the Frogs repented when too late. Better no rule than cruel rule. The Mountains in Labour One day the Countrymen noticed that the Mountains were in labour; smoke came out of their summits, the earth was quaking at their feet, trees were crashing, and huge rocks were tumbling. They felt sure that something horrible was going to happen. They all gathered together in one place to see what terrible thing this could be. They waited and they waited, but nothing came. At last there was a still more violent earthquake, and a huge gap appeared in the side of the Mountains. They all fell down upon their knees and waited. At last, and at last, a teeny, tiny mouse poked its little head and bristles out of the gap and came running down towards them, and ever after they used to say: \u201cMuch outcry, little outcome.\u201d The Hares and the Frogs The Hares were so persecuted by the other beasts, they did not know where to go. As soon as they saw a single animal approach them, off they used to run. One day they saw a troop of wild Horses stampeding about, and in quite a panic all the Hares scuttled off to a lake hard by, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear. But just as they got near the bank of the lake, a troop of Frogs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Hares scuttled off, and jumped into the water. \u201cTruly,\u201d said one of the Hares, \u201cthings are not so bad as they seem: \u201cThere is always someone worse off than yourself.\u201d The Wolf and the Kid A Kid was perched up on the top of a house, and looking down saw a Wolf passing under him. Immediately he began to revile and attack his enemy. \u201cMurderer and thief,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhat do you here near honest folks\u2019 houses? How dare you make an appearance where your vile deeds are known?\u201d \u201cCurse away, my young friend,\u201d said the Wolf. \u201cIt is easy to be brave from a safe distance.\u201d The Woodman and the Serpent One wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when he saw something black lying on the snow. When he came closer he saw it was a Serpent to all appearance dead. But he took it up and put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home. As soon as he got indoors he put the Serpent down on the hearth before the fire. The children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again. Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but the Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death. So the Woodman seized his axe, and with one stroke cut the Serpent in two. \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cNo gratitude from the wicked.\u201d The Bald Man and the Fly There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summer\u2019s day. A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time. The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but\u2014_whack_\u2014his palm came on his head instead; again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and said: \u201cYou will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies.\u201d The Fox and the Stork At one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemed very good friends. So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish. This the Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end of her long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cthe soup is not to your liking.\u201d \u201cPray do not apologise,\u201d said the Stork. \u201cI hope you will return this visit, and come and dine with me soon.\u201d So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but when they were seated at table all that was for their dinner was contained in a very long necked jar with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox could not insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was to lick the outside of the jar. \u201cI will not apologise for the dinner,\u201d said the Stork: \u201cOne bad turn deserves another.\u201d The Fox and the Mask A Fox had by some means got into the store room of a theatre. Suddenly he observed a face glaring down on him and began to be very frightened; but looking more closely he found it was only a Mask such as actors use to put over their face. \u201cAh,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cyou look very fine; it is a pity you have not got any brains.\u201d Outside show is a poor substitute for inner worth. The Jay and the Peacock A Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were moulting. He tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the Peacocks. When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes. So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from a distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him: \u201cIt is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.\u201d The Frog and the Ox \u201cOh Father,\u201d said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool, \u201cI have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs divided in two.\u201d \u201cTush, child, tush,\u201d said the old Frog, \u201cthat was only Farmer White\u2019s Ox. It isn\u2019t so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see.\u201d So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out. \u201cWas he as big as that?\u201d asked he. \u201cOh, much bigger than that,\u201d said the young Frog. Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that. \u201cBigger, father, bigger,\u201d was the reply. So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelled and swelled and swelled. And then he said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the Ox is not as big as this. But at this moment he burst. Self conceit may lead to self destruction. Androcles A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest. As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying down moaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog. Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena. Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest. Gratitude is the sign of noble souls. The Bat, the Birds, and the Beasts A great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and the Beasts. When the two armies were collected together the Bat hesitated which to join. The Birds that passed his perch said: \u201cCome with us\u201d; but he said: \u201cI am a Beast.\u201d Later on, some Beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said: \u201cCome with us\u201d; but he said: \u201cI am a Bird.\u201d Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle took place, so the Bat came to the Birds and wished to join in the rejoicings, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away. He then went to the Beasts, but soon had to beat a retreat, or else they would have torn him to pieces. \u201cAh,\u201d said the Bat, \u201cI see now, \u201cHe that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends.\u201d The Hart and the Hunter The Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there. \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cwhere can you see such noble horns as these, with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight.\u201d At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him. Away bounded the Hart, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up. \u201cAlas! alas!\u201d cried the Hart: \u201cWe often despise what is most useful to us.\u201d The Serpent and the File A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an armourer\u2019s shop. As he glided over the floor he felt his skin pricked by a file lying there. In a rage he turned round upon it and tried to dart his fangs into it; but he could do no harm to heavy iron and had soon to give over his wrath. It is useless attacking the insensible. The Man and the Wood A Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and begged all the Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular purpose. The Trees were good natured and gave him one of their branches. What did the Man do but fix it into the axe head, and soon set to work cutting down tree after tree. Then the Trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves. The Dog and the Wolf A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to meet a House dog who was passing by. \u201cAh, Cousin,\u201d said the Dog. \u201cI knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you. Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly given to you?\u201d \u201cI would have no objection,\u201d said the Wolf, \u201cif I could only get a place.\u201d \u201cI will easily arrange that for you,\u201d said the Dog; \u201ccome with me to my master and you shall share my work.\u201d So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together. On the way there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the Dog\u2019s neck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about. \u201cOh, it is nothing,\u201d said the Dog. \u201cThat is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d said the Wolf. \u201cThen good bye to you, Master Dog.\u201d Better starve free than be a fat slave. The Belly and the Members One fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they were doing all the work and the Belly was having all the food. So they held a meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to strike work till the Belly consented to take its proper share of the work. So for a day or two, the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receive it, and the Teeth had no work to do. But after a day or two the Members began to find that they themselves were not in a very active condition: the Hands could hardly move, and the Mouth was all parched and dry, while the Legs were unable to support the rest. So thus they found that even the Belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessary work for the Body, and that all must work together or the Body will go to pieces. The Hart in the Ox Stall A Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns. Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Hart. The stable boys, who had been resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away. Shortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken place. He pointed to the truss of hay and said: \u201cWhat are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?\u201d And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Hart, and soon made an end of him. He thus learnt that Nothing escapes the master\u2019s eye. The Fox and the Grapes One hot summer\u2019s day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch. \u201cJust the thing to quench my thirst,\u201d quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: \u201cI am sure they are sour.\u201d It is easy to despise what you cannot get. The Peacock and Juno A Peacock once placed a petition before Juno desiring to have the voice of a nightingale in addition to his other attractions; but Juno refused his request. When he persisted, and pointed out that he was her favourite bird, she said: \u201cBe content with your lot; one cannot be first in everything.\u201d The Horse, Hunter, and Stag A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag. The Hunter agreed, but said: \u201cIf you desire to conquer the Stag, you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your jaws, so that I may guide you with these reins, and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back so that I may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy.\u201d The Horse agreed to the conditions, and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled him. Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag, and said to the Hunter: \u201cNow, get off, and remove those things from my mouth and back.\u201d \u201cNot so fast, friend,\u201d said the Hunter. \u201cI have now got you under bit and spur, and prefer to keep you as you are at present.\u201d If you allow men to use you for your own purposes, they will use you for theirs. The Fox and the Lion When first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened, and ran away and hid himself in the wood. Next time however he came near the King of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and watched him pass by. The third time they came near one another the Fox went straight up to the Lion and passed the time of day with him, asking him how his family were, and when he should have the pleasure of seeing him again; then turning his tail, he parted from the Lion without much ceremony. Familiarity breeds contempt. The Lion and the Statue A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions in general. The Man contended that he and his fellows were stronger than lions by reason of their greater intelligence. \u201cCome now with me,\u201d he cried, \u201cand I will soon prove that I am right.\u201d So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a statue of Hercules overcoming the Lion and tearing his mouth in two. \u201cThat is all very well,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cbut proves nothing, for it was a man who made the statue.\u201d We can easily represent things as we wish them to be. The Ant and the Grasshopper In a field one summer\u2019s day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart\u2019s content. An Ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest. \u201cWhy not come and chat with me,\u201d said the Grasshopper, \u201cinstead of toiling and moiling in that way?\u201d \u201cI am helping to lay up food for the winter,\u201d said the Ant, \u201cand recommend you to do the same.\u201d \u201cWhy bother about winter?\u201d said the Grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present.\u201d But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil. When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer. Then the Grasshopper knew: It is best to prepare for the days of necessity. The Tree and the Reed \u201cWell, little one,\u201d said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot, \u201cwhy do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air as I do?\u201d \u201cI am contented with my lot,\u201d said the Reed. \u201cI may not be so grand, but I think I am safer.\u201d \u201cSafe!\u201d sneered the Tree. \u201cWho shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground?\u201d But it soon had to repent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots, and cast it a useless log on the ground, while the little Reed, bending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over. Obscurity often brings safety. The Fox and the Cat A Fox was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escaping its enemies. \u201cI have a whole bag of tricks,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies.\u201d \u201cI have only one,\u201d said the Cat; \u201cbut I can generally manage with that.\u201d Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming towards them, and the Cat immediately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs. \u201cThis is my plan,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d The Fox thought first of one way, then of another, and while he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at last the Fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen. Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said: \u201cBetter one safe way than a hundred on which you cannot reckon.\u201d The Wolf in Sheep\u2019s Clothing A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep\u2019s clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals. Appearances are deceptive. The Dog in the Manger A Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox and lay there cosily upon the straw. But soon the Ox, returning from its afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of the straw. The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood up and barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it. At last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, and went away muttering: \u201cAh, people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves.\u201d The Man and the Wooden God In the old days men used to worship sticks and stones and idols, and prayed to them to give them luck. It happened that a Man had often prayed to a wooden idol he had received from his father, but his luck never seemed to change. He prayed and he prayed, but still he remained as unlucky as ever. One day in the greatest rage he went to the Wooden God, and with one blow swept it down from its pedestal. The idol broke in two, and what did he see? An immense number of coins flying all over the place. The Fisher A Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his nose out of the water. So he cast his net into the river and soon drew it forth filled with fish. Then he took his bagpipes again, and, as he played, the fish leapt up in the net. \u201cAh, you dance now when I play,\u201d said he. \u201cYes,\u201d said an old Fish: \u201cWhen you are in a man\u2019s power you must do as he bids you.\u201d The Shepherd\u2019s Boy There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out \u201cWolf, Wolf,\u201d and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out \u201cWolf, Wolf,\u201d still louder than before. But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy\u2019s flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said: \u201cA liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.\u201d The Young Thief and His Mother A young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it. He expressed his desire to see his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of course this was granted. When his Mother came to him he said: \u201cI want to whisper to you,\u201d and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off. All the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct. \u201cIt is to punish her,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was young I began with stealing little things, and brought them home to Mother. Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and said: \u201cIt will not be noticed.\u201d It is because of her that I am here to day.\u201d \u201cHe is right, woman,\u201d said the Priest; \u201cthe Lord hath said: \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart therefrom.\u201d The Man and His Two Wives In the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a middle aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young; each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself. Now the Man\u2019s hair was turning grey, which the young Wife did not like, as it made him look too old for her husband. So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones. But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother. So every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could. The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald. Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield. The Nurse and the Wolf \u201cBe quiet now,\u201d said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap. \u201cIf you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf.\u201d Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said. So he crouched down by the side of the house and waited. \u201cI am in good luck to day,\u201d thought he. \u201cIt is sure to cry soon, and a daintier morsel I haven\u2019t had for many a long day.\u201d So he waited, and he waited, and he waited, till at last the child began to cry, and the Wolf came forward before the window, and looked up to the Nurse, wagging his tail. But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help, and the dogs of the house came rushing out. \u201cAh,\u201d said the Wolf as he galloped away, \u201cEnemies\u2019 promises were made to be broken.\u201d The Tortoise and the Birds A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble. The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft. On their way they met a Crow, who said to the Eagle: \u201cTortoise is good eating.\u201d \u201cThe shell is too hard,\u201d said the Eagle in reply. \u201cThe rocks will soon crack the shell,\u201d was the Crow\u2019s answer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise. Never soar aloft on an enemy\u2019s pinions. The Two Crabs One fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a stroll on the sand. \u201cChild,\u201d said the mother, \u201cyou are walking very ungracefully. You should accustom yourself, to walking straight forward without twisting from side to side.\u201d \u201cPray, mother,\u201d said the young one, \u201cdo but set the example yourself, and I will follow you.\u201d Example is the best precept. The Ass in the Lion\u2019s Skin An Ass once found a Lion\u2019s skin which the hunters had left out in the sun to dry. He put it on and went towards his native village. All fled at his approach, both men and animals, and he was a proud Ass that day. In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed, but then every one knew him, and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the fright he had caused. And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said: \u201cAh, I knew you by your voice.\u201d Fine clothes may disguise, but silly words will disclose a fool. The Two Fellows and the Bear Two Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a Bear rushed out upon them. One of the travellers happened to be in front, and he seized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid himself among the leaves. The other, seeing no help for it, threw himself flat down upon the ground, with his face in the dust. The Bear, coming up to him, put his muzzle close to his ear, and sniffed and sniffed. But at last with a growl he shook his head and slouched off, for bears will not touch dead meat. Then the fellow in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said \u201cWhat was it that Master Bruin whispered to you?\u201d \u201cHe told me,\u201d said the other, \u201cNever trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch.\u201d The Two Pots Two Pots had been left on the bank of a river, one of brass, and one of earthenware. When the tide rose they both floated off down the stream. Now the earthenware pot tried its best to keep aloof from the brass one, which cried out: \u201cFear nothing, friend, I will not strike you.\u201d \u201cBut I may come in contact with you,\u201d said the other, \u201cif I come too close; and whether I hit you, or you hit me, I shall suffer for it.\u201d The strong and the weak cannot keep company. The Four Oxen and the Lion A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell. Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them. At last, however, they fell a quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field. Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four. United we stand, divided we fall. The Fisher and the Little Fish It happened that a Fisher, after fishing all day, caught only a little fish. \u201cPray, let me go, master,\u201d said the Fish. \u201cI am much too small for your eating just now. If you put me back into the river I shall soon grow, then you can make a fine meal off me.\u201d \u201cNay, nay, my little Fish,\u201d said the Fisher, \u201cI have you now. I may not catch you hereafter.\u201d A little thing in hand is worth more than a great thing in prospect. Avaricious and Envious Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts\u2019 desire. Now the one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy. So to punish them both, Jupiter granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his neighbour had twice as much. The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold. No sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal. Then came the turn of the Envious man, who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all. So he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out, by which means his companion would become totally blind. Vices are their own punishment. The Crow and the Pitcher A Crow, half dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had once been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the mouth of the Pitcher he found that only very little water was left in it, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it. He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair. Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near him, and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench his thirst and save his life. Little by little does the trick. The Man and the Satyr A Man had lost his way in a wood one bitter winter\u2019s night. As he was roaming about, a Satyr came up to him, and finding that he had lost his way, promised to give him a lodging for the night, and guide him out of the forest in the morning. As he went along to the Satyr\u2019s cell, the Man raised both his hands to his mouth and kept on blowing at them. \u201cWhat do you do that for?\u201d said the Satyr. \u201cMy hands are numb with the cold,\u201d said the Man, \u201cand my breath warms them.\u201d After this they arrived at the Satyr\u2019s home, and soon the Satyr put a smoking dish of porridge before him. But when the Man raised his spoon to his mouth he began blowing upon it. \u201cAnd what do you do that for?\u201d said the Satyr. \u201cThe porridge is too hot, and my breath will cool it.\u201d \u201cOut you go,\u201d said the Satyr. \u201cI will have nought to do with a man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath.\u201d The Goose With the Golden Eggs One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering. When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away, because he thought a trick had been played upon him. But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold. Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs. As he grew rich he grew greedy; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give, he killed it and opened it only to find nothing. Greed oft o\u2019er reaches itself. The Labourer and the Nightingale A Labourer lay listening to a Nightingale\u2019s song throughout the summer night. So pleased was he with it that the next night he set a trap for it and captured it. \u201cNow that I have caught thee,\u201d he cried, \u201cthou shalt always sing to me.\u201d \u201cWe Nightingales never sing in a cage.\u201d said the bird. \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat thee.\u201d said the Labourer. \u201cI have always heard say that a nightingale on toast is dainty morsel.\u201d \u201cNay, kill me not,\u201d said the Nightingale; \u201cbut let me free, and I\u2019ll tell thee three things far better worth than my poor body.\u201d The Labourer let him loose, and he flew up to a branch of a tree and said: \u201cNever believe a captive\u2019s promise; that\u2019s one thing. Then again: Keep what you have. And third piece of advice is: Sorrow not over what is lost forever.\u201d Then the song bird flew away. The Fox, the Cock, and the Dog One moonlight night a Fox was prowling about a farmer\u2019s hen coop, and saw a Cock roosting high up beyond his reach. \u201cGood news, good news!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, what is that?\u201d said the Cock. \u201cKing Lion has declared a universal truce. No beast may hurt a bird henceforth, but all shall dwell together in brotherly friendship.\u201d \u201cWhy, that is good news,\u201d said the Cock; \u201cand there I see some one coming, with whom we can share the good tidings.\u201d And so saying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off. \u201cWhat is it you see?\u201d said the Fox. \u201cIt is only my master\u2019s Dog that is coming towards us. What, going so soon?\u201d he continued, as the Fox began to turn away as soon as he had heard the news. \u201cWill you not stop and congratulate the Dog on the reign of universal peace?\u201d \u201cI would gladly do so,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I fear he may not have heard of King Lion\u2019s decree.\u201d Cunning often outwits itself. The Wind and the Sun The Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. Suddenly they saw a traveller coming down the road, and the Sun said: \u201cI see a way to decide our dispute. Whichever of us can cause that traveller to take off his cloak shall be regarded as the stronger. You begin.\u201d So the Sun retired behind a cloud, and the Wind began to blow as hard as it could upon the traveller. But the harder he blew the more closely did the traveller wrap his cloak round him, till at last the Wind had to give up in despair. Then the Sun came out and shone in all his glory upon the traveller, who soon found it too hot to walk with his cloak on. Kindness effects more than severity. Hercules and the Waggoner A Waggoner was once driving a heavy load along a very muddy way. At last he came to a part of the road where the wheels sank half way into the mire, and the more the horses pulled, the deeper sank the wheels. So the Waggoner threw down his whip, and knelt down and prayed to Hercules the Strong. \u201cO Hercules, help me in this my hour of distress,\u201d quoth he. But Hercules appeared to him, and said: \u201cTut, man, don\u2019t sprawl there. Get up and put your shoulder to the wheel.\u201d The gods help them that help themselves. The Miser and His Gold Once upon a time there was a Miser who used to hide his gold at the foot of a tree in his garden; but every week he used to go and dig it up and gloat over his gains. A robber, who had noticed this, went and dug up the gold and decamped with it. When the Miser next came to gloat over his treasures, he found nothing but the empty hole. He tore his hair, and raised such an outcry that all the neighbours came around him, and he told them how he used to come and visit his gold. \u201cDid you ever take any of it out?\u201d asked one of them. \u201cNay,\u201d said he, \u201cI only came to look at it.\u201d \u201cThen come again and look at the hole,\u201d said a neighbour; \u201cit will do you just as much good.\u201d Wealth unused might as well not exist. The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey A Man and his son were once going with their Donkey to market. As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: \u201cYou fools, what is a Donkey for but to ride upon?\u201d So the Man put the Boy on the Donkey and they went on their way. But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: \u201cSee that lazy youngster, he lets his father walk while he rides.\u201d So the Man ordered his Boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn\u2019t gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other: \u201cShame on that lazy lout to let his poor little son trudge along.\u201d Well, the Man didn\u2019t know what to do, but at last he took his Boy up before him on the Donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers by began to jeer and point at them. The Man stopped and asked what they were scoffing at. The men said: \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey of yours and your hulking son?\u201d The Man and Boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought and they thought, till at last they cut down a pole, tied the donkey\u2019s feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders. They went along amid the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the Donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the Boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle the Donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore feet being tied together he was drowned. \u201cThat will teach you,\u201d said an old man who had followed them: \u201cPlease all, and you will please none.\u201d The Fox and the Mosquitoes A Fox after crossing a river got its tail entangled in a bush, and could not move. A number of Mosquitoes seeing its plight settled upon it and enjoyed a good meal undisturbed by its tail. A hedgehog strolling by took pity upon the Fox and went up to him: \u201cYou are in a bad way, neighbour,\u201d said the hedgehog; \u201cshall I relieve you by driving off those Mosquitoes who are sucking your blood?\u201d \u201cThank you, Master Hedgehog,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I would rather not.\u201d \u201cWhy, how is that?\u201d asked the hedgehog. \u201cWell, you see,\u201d was the answer, \u201cthese Mosquitoes have had their fill; if you drive these away, others will come with fresh appetite and bleed me to death.\u201d The Fox Without a Tail It happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in struggling to release himself lost all of it but the stump. At first he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes. But at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them. When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails. He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another. He failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance. \u201cThat is all very well,\u201d said one of the older foxes; \u201cbut I do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself.\u201d Distrust interested advice. The One Eyed Doe A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and could not see any one approaching her on that side. So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea, with her sound eye looking towards the land. By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land, and often escaped by this means. But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye, and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea. \u201cAh,\u201d cried she with her dying voice, \u201cYou cannot escape your fate.\u201d Belling the Cat Long ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat. Some said this, and some said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet the case. \u201cYou will all agree,\u201d said he, \u201cthat our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood.\u201d This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said: \u201cThat is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?\u201d The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke. Then the old mouse said: \u201cIt is easy to propose impossible remedies.\u201d The Hare and the Tortoise The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. \u201cI have never yet been beaten,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me.\u201d The Tortoise said quietly, \u201cI accept your challenge.\u201d \u201cThat is a good joke,\u201d said the Hare; \u201cI could dance round you all the way.\u201d \u201cKeep your boasting till you\u2019ve beaten,\u201d answered the Tortoise. \u201cShall we race?\u201d So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning post and could not run up in time to save the race. Then said the Tortoise: \u201cPlodding wins the race.\u201d The Old Man and Death An old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in a forest. At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks, and cried out: \u201cI cannot bear this life any longer. Ah, I wish Death would only come and take me!\u201d As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him: \u201cWhat wouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me.\u201d \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied the woodcutter, \u201cwould you kindly help me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?\u201d We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified. The Hare With Many Friends A Hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed to be her friends. But one day she heard the hounds approaching and hoped to escape them by the aid of her many Friends. So, she went to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back. But he declined, stating that he had important work to do for his master. \u201cHe felt sure,\u201d he said, \u201cthat all her other friends would come to her assistance.\u201d She then applied to the bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns. The bull replied: \u201cI am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you want.\u201d The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The ram, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and told him the case. The ram replied: \u201cAnother time, my dear friend. I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares.\u201d The Hare then applied, as a last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task. By this time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped. He that has many friends, has no friends. The Lion in Love A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents. The old people did not know what to say. They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts. At last the father said: \u201cWe feel highly honoured by your Majesty\u2019s proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider your proposal again.\u201d The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out. But when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst. Love can tame the wildest. The Bundle of Sticks An old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him to give them some parting advice. He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot of sticks, and said to his eldest son: \u201cBreak it.\u201d The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the Bundle. The other sons also tried, but none of them was successful. \u201cUntie the faggots,\u201d said the father, \u201cand each of you take a stick.\u201d When they had done so, he called out to them: \u201cNow, break,\u201d and each stick was easily broken. \u201cYou see my meaning,\u201d said their father. Union gives strength. The Lion, the Fox, and the Beasts The Lion once gave out that he was sick unto death and summoned the animals to come and hear his last Will and Testament. So the Goat came to the Lion\u2019s cave, and stopped there listening for a long time. Then a Sheep went in, and before she came out a Calf came up to receive the last wishes of the Lord of the Beasts. But soon the Lion seemed to recover, and came to the mouth of his cave, and saw the Fox, who had been waiting outside for some time. \u201cWhy do you not come to pay your respects to me?\u201d said the Lion to the Fox. \u201cI beg your Majesty\u2019s pardon,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I noticed the track of the animals that have already come to you; and while I see many hoof marks going in, I see none coming out. Till the animals that have entered your cave come out again I prefer to remain in the open air.\u201d It is easier to get into the enemy\u2019s toils than out again. The Ass\u2019s Brains The Lion and the Fox went hunting together. The Lion, on the advice of the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance between their two families. The Ass came to the place of meeting, overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance. But when he came there the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox: \u201cHere is our dinner for to day. Watch you here while I go and have a nap. Woe betide you if you touch my prey.\u201d The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but finding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains of the Ass and ate them up. When the Lion came back he soon noticed the absence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice: \u201cWhat have you done with the brains?\u201d \u201cBrains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have fallen into your trap.\u201d Wit has always an answer ready. The Eagle and the Arrow An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death. Slowly it fluttered down to the earth, with its life blood pouring out of it. Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes. \u201cAlas!\u201d it cried, as it died, \u201cWe often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.\u201d The Cat Maiden The gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being to change its nature. Jupiter said \u201cYes,\u201d but Venus said \u201cNo.\u201d So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a Maiden, and gave her to a young man for a wife. The wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding feast. \u201cSee,\u201d said Jupiter, to Venus, \u201chow becomingly she behaves. Who could tell that yesterday she was but a Cat? Surely her nature is changed?\u201d \u201cWait a minute,\u201d replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the room. No sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from her seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse. \u201cAh, you see,\u201d said Venus, \u201cNature will out.\u201d The Milkmaid and Her Pail Patty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a Pail on her head. As she went along she began calculating what she would do with the money she would get for the milk. \u201cI\u2019ll buy some fowls from Farmer Brown,\u201d said she, \u201cand they will lay eggs each morning, which I will sell to the parson\u2019s wife. With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs I\u2019ll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won\u2019t all the young men come up and speak to me! Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don\u2019t care. I shall just look at her and toss my head like this. As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt. So she had to go home and tell her mother what had occurred. \u201cAh, my child,\u201d said the mother, \u201cDo not count your chickens before they are hatched.\u201d The Horse and the Ass A Horse and an Ass were travelling together, the Horse prancing along in its fine trappings, the Ass carrying with difficulty the heavy weight in its panniers. \u201cI wish I were you,\u201d sighed the Ass; \u201cnothing to do and well fed, and all that fine harness upon you.\u201d Next day, however, there was a great battle, and the Horse was wounded to death in the final charge of the day. His friend, the Ass, happened to pass by shortly afterwards and found him on the point of death. \u201cI was wrong,\u201d said the Ass: \u201cBetter humble security than gilded danger.\u201d The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner A Trumpeter during a battle ventured too near the enemy and was captured by them. They were about to proceed to put him to death when he begged them to hear his plea for mercy. \u201cI do not fight,\u201d said he, \u201cand indeed carry no weapon; I only blow this trumpet, and surely that cannot harm you; then why should you kill me?\u201d \u201cYou may not fight yourself,\u201d said the others, \u201cbut you encourage and guide your men to the fight.\u201d Words may be deeds. The Buffoon and the Countryman At a country fair there was a Buffoon who made all the people laugh by imitating the cries of various animals. He finished off by squeaking so like a pig that the spectators thought that he had a porker concealed about him. But a Countryman who stood by said: \u201cCall that a pig\u2019s squeak! Nothing like it. You give me till tomorrow and I will show you what it\u2019s like.\u201d The audience laughed, but next day, sure enough, the Countryman appeared on the stage, and putting his head down squealed so hideously that the spectators hissed and threw stones at him to make him stop. \u201cYou fools!\u201d he cried, \u201csee what you have been hissing,\u201d and held up a little pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter the squeals. Men often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing. The Old Woman and the Wine Jar You must know that sometimes old women like a glass of wine. One of this sort once found a Wine jar lying in the road, and eagerly went up to it hoping to find it full. But when she took it up she found that all the wine had been drunk out of it. Still she took a long sniff at the mouth of the Jar. \u201cAh,\u201d she cried, \u201cWhat memories cling \u2019round the instruments of our pleasure.\u201d The Fox and the Goat By an unlucky chance a Fox fell into a deep well from which he could not get out. A Goat passed by shortly afterwards, and asked the Fox what he was doing down there. \u201cOh, have you not heard?\u201d said the Fox; \u201cthere is going to be a great drought, so I jumped down here in order to be sure to have water by me. Why don\u2019t you come down too?\u201d The Goat thought well of this advice, and jumped down into the well. But the Fox immediately jumped on her back, and by putting his foot on her long horns managed to jump up to the edge of the well. \u201cGood bye, friend,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cremember next time, \u201cNever trust the advice of a man in difficulties.\u201d And this is the end of \u00c6sop\u2019s Fables.

        "Almost all the fables that have appeared in the Western world have been sheltered at one time or another under the shadow of that name.",
        "I could at any rate enumerate at least seven hundred which have appeared in English in various books entitled _\u00c6sop\u2019s Fables_.",
        "L\u2019Estrange\u2019s collection alone contains over five hundred.",
        "In the struggle for existence among all these a certain number stand out as being the most effective and the most familiar.",
        "I have attempted to bring most of these into the following pages.",
        "There is no fixed text even for the nucleus collection contained in this book.",
        "\u00c6sop himself is so shadowy a figure that we might almost be forgiven if we held, with regard to him, the heresy of Mistress Elizabeth Prig.",
        "What we call his fables can in most cases be traced back to the fables of other people, notably of Ph\u00e6drus and Babrius.",
        "It is usual to regard the Greek Prose Collections, passing under the name of \u00c6sop, as having greater claims to the eponymous title; but modern research has shown that these are but medieval prosings of Babrius\u2019s verse.",
        "I have therefore felt at liberty to retell the fables in such a way as would interest children, and have adopted from the various versions that which seemed most suitable in each case, telling the fable anew in my own way.",
        "Much has been learnt during the present century about the history of the various apologues that walk abroad under the name of \u201c\u00c6sop.\u201d I have attempted to bring these various lines of research together in the somewhat elaborate introductory volume which I wrote to accompany my edition of Caxton\u2019s _\u00c6sop_, published by Mr.",
        "Nutt in his _Biblioth\u00e8que de Carabas_.",
        "I have placed in front of the present version of the \u201cFables,\u201d by kind permission of Mr.",
        "Nutt, the short abstract of my researches in which I there summed up the results of that volume.",
        "I must accompany it, here as there, by a warning to the reader, that for a large proportion of the results thus reached I am myself responsible; but I am happy to say that many of them have been accepted by the experts in America, France, and Germany, who have done me the honour to consider my researches.",
        "Here, in England, there does not seem to be much interest in this class of work, and English scholars, for the most part, are content to remain in ignorance of the methods and results of literary history.",
        "I have attached to the \u201cFables\u201d in the obscurity of small print at the end a series of notes, summing up what is known as to the _provenance_ of each fable.",
        "Here, again, I have tried to put in shorter and more readable form the results of my researches in the volume to which I have already referred.",
        "For more detailed information I must refer to the forty closely printed pages (vol.",
        "225 268) which contain the bibliography of the Fables.",
        "JOSEPH JACOBS.",
        "A SHORT HISTORY OF THE \u00c6SOPIC FABLE Most nations develop the Beast Tale as part of their folk lore, some go further and apply it to satiric purposes, and a few nations afford isolated examples of the shaping of the Beast Tale to teach some moral truth by means of the Fable properly so called.[1] But only two peoples independently made this a general practice.",
        "Both in Greece[2] and in India we find in the earliest literature such casual and frequent mention of Fables as seems to imply a body of Folk Fables current among the people.",
        "And in both countries special circumstances raised the Fable from folklore into literature.",
        "In Greece, during the epoch of the Tyrants, when free speech was dangerous, the Fable was largely used for political purposes.",
        "The inventor of this application or the most prominent user of it was one \u00c6sop, a slave at Samos whose name has ever since been connected with the Fable.",
        "All that we know about him is contained in a few lines of Herodotus: that he flourished 550 B.C.; was killed in accordance with a Delphian oracle; and that _wergild_ was claimed for him by the grandson of his master, Iadmon.",
        "When free speech was established in the Greek democracies, the custom of using Fables in harangues was continued and encouraged by the rhetoricians, while the mirth producing qualities of the Fable caused it to be regarded as fit subject of after dinner conversation along with other jests of a broader kind (\u201cMilesian,\u201d \u201cSybaritic\u201d).",
        "This habit of regarding the Fable as a form of the Jest intensified the tendency to connect it with a well known name as in the case of our Joe Miller.",
        "About 300 B.C.",
        "Demetrius Phalereus, whilom tyrant of Athens and founder of the Alexandria Library, collected together all the Fables he could find under the title of _Assemblies of \u00c6sopic Tales_ (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u1f30\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03b3\u03b1\u03b9).",
        "This collection, running probably to some 200 Fables, after being interpolated and edited by the Alexandrine grammarians, was turned into neat Latin iambics by Ph\u00e6drus, a Greek freedman of Augustus in the early years of the Christian era.",
        "As the modern \u00c6sop is mainly derived from Ph\u00e6drus, the answer to the question \u201cWho wrote \u00c6sop?\u201d is simple : \u201cDemetrius of Phaleron.\u201d[3] [1] _E.g._ Jotham\u2019s Fable, Judges ix., and that of Menenius Agrippa in Livy, seem to be quite independent of either Greek or Indian influence.",
        "But one fable does not make Fable.",
        "[2] Only about twenty fables, however, are known in Greece before Ph\u00e6drus, 30 A.D.",
        "See my Caxton\u2019s _\u00c6sop_ vol.",
        "26\u201329, for a complete enumeration.",
        "[3] For this statement and what follows a reference to the Pedigree of the Fables on p.",
        "196 will be found useful.",
        "In India the great ethical reformer, Sakyamuni, the Buddha, initiated (or adopted from the Brahmins) the habit of using the Beast Tale for moral purposes, or, in other words, transformed it into the Fable proper.",
        "A collection of these seems to have existed previously and independently, in which the Fables were associated with the name of a mythical sage, Kasy\u00e2pa.",
        "These were appropriated by the early Buddhists by the simple expedient of making Kasy\u00e2pa the immediately preceding incarnation of the Buddha.",
        "A number of his _itih\u00e2sas_ or Tales were included in the sacred Buddhistic work containing the _J\u0101takas_ or previous births of the Buddha, in some of which the Bodisat (or future Buddha) appears as one of the Dramatis Person\u00e6 of the Fables; the Crane, _e.g._, in our _Wolf and Crane_ being one of the incarnations of the Buddha.",
        "So, too, the Lamb of our _Wolf and Lamb_ was once Buddha; it was therefore easy for him\u2014so the Buddhists thought\u2014to remember and tell these Fables as incidents of his former careers.",
        "It is obvious that the whole idea of a Fable as an anecdote about a man masquerading in the form of a beast could most easily arise and gain currency where the theory of transmigration was vividly credited.",
        "The Fables of Kasy\u00e2pa, or rather the moral verses (_gathas_) which served as a _memoria technica_ to them, were probably carried over to Ceylon in 241 B.C.",
        "along with the J\u0101takas.",
        "About 300 years later (say 50 A.D.) some 100 of these were brought by a Cingalese embassy to Alexandria, where they were translated under the title of \u201cLibyan Fables\u201d (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9 \u039b\u03c5\u03b2\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af), which had been earlier applied to similar stories that had percolated to Hellas from India; they were attributed to \u201cKybises.\u201d This collection seems to have introduced the habit of summing up the teaching of a Fable in the Moral, corresponding to the _gatha_ of the J\u0101takas.",
        "About the end of the first century A.D.",
        "the Libyan Fables of \u201cKybises\u201d became known to the Rabbinic school at Jabne, founded by R.",
        "Jochanan ben Saccai, and a number of the Fables translated into Aramaic which are still extant in the Talmud and Midrash.",
        "In the Roman world the two collections of Demetrius and \u201cKybises\u201d were brought together by Nicostratus, a rhetor attached to the court of Marcus Aurelius.",
        "In the earlier part of the next century (c.",
        "230 A.D.) this _corpus_ of the ancient fable, \u00c6sopic and Libyan, amounting in all to some 300 members, was done into Greek verse with Latin accentuation (choliambics) by Valerius Babrius, tutor to the young son of Alexander Severus.",
        "Still later, towards the end of the fourth century, forty two of these, mainly of the Libyan section, were translated into Latin verse by one Avian, with whom the ancient history of the Fable ends.",
        "In the Middle Ages it was naturally the Latin Ph\u00e6drus that represented the \u00c6sopic Fable to the learned world, but Ph\u00e6drus in a fuller form than has descended to us in verse.",
        "A selection of some eighty fables was turned into indifferent prose in the ninth century, probably at the Schools of Charles the Great.",
        "This was attributed to a fictitious Romulus.",
        "Another prose collection by Ademar of Chabannes was made before 1030, and still preserves some of the lines of the lost Fables of Ph\u00e6drus.",
        "The Fables became especially popular among the Normans.",
        "A number of them occur on the Bayeux Tapestry, and in the twelfth century England, the head of the Angevin empire, became the home of the Fable, all the important adaptations and versions of \u00c6sop being made in this country.",
        "One of these done into Latin verse by Walter the Englishman became the standard \u00c6sop of medieval Christendom.",
        "The same history applies in large measure to the Fables of Avian, which were done into prose, transferred back into Latin verse, and sent forth through Europe from England.",
        "Meanwhile Babrius had been suffering the same fate as Ph\u00e6drus.",
        "His scazons were turned into poor Greek prose, and selections of them pass to this day as the original Fables of \u00c6sop.",
        "Some fifty of these were selected, and with the addition of a dozen Oriental fables, were attributed to an imaginary Persian sage, Syntipas; this collection was translated into Syriac, and thence into Arabic, where they passed under the name of the legendary L\u00f4qman (probably a doublet of Balaam).",
        "A still larger collection of the Greek prose versions got into Arabic, where it was enriched by some 60 fables from the Arabic Bidpai and other sources, but still passed under the name of \u00c6sop.",
        "This collection, containing 164 fables, was brought to England after the Third Crusade of Richard I., and translated into Latin by an Englishman named Alfred, with the aid of an Oxford Jew named Berachyah ha Nakdan (\u201cBenedictus le Puncteur\u201d in the English Records), who, on his own account, translated a number of the fables into Hebrew rhymed prose, under the Talmudic title _Mishle Shu\u2018alim_ (Fox Fables).[4] Part of Alfred\u2019s \u00c6sop was translated into English alliterative verse, and this again was translated about 1200 into French by Marie de France, who attributed the new fables to King Alfred.",
        "After her no important addition was made to the medieval \u00c6sop.",
        "[4] I have given specimens of his Fables in my _Jews of Angevin England_, pp.",
        "165\u2013173, 278\u2013281.",
        "With the invention of printing the European book of \u00c6sop was compiled about 1480 by Heinrich Stainh\u00f6wel, who put together the Romulus with selections from Avian, some of the Greek prose versions of Babrius from Ranuzio\u2019s translation, and a few from Alfred\u2019s \u00c6sop.",
        "To these he added the legendary life of \u00c6sop and a selection of somewhat loose tales from Petrus Alphonsi and Poggio Bracciolini, corresponding to the Milesian and Sybaritic tales which were associated with the Fable in antiquity.",
        "Stainh\u00f6wel translated all this into German, and within twenty years his collection had been turned into French, English (by Caxton, in 1484), Italian, Dutch, and Spanish.",
        "Additions were made to it by Brandt and Waldis in Germany, by L\u2019Estrange in England, and by La Fontaine in France; these were chiefly from the larger Greek collections published after Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s day, and, in the case of La Fontaine, from Bidpai and other Oriental sources.",
        "But these additions have rarely taken hold, and the \u00c6sop of modern Europe is in large measure Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s, even to the present day.",
        "The first three quarters of the present collection are Stainh\u00f6wel mainly in Stainh\u00f6wel\u2019s order.",
        "Selections from it passed into spelling and reading books, and made the Fables part of modern European folk lore.[5] [5] An episode in the history of the modern \u00c6sop deserves record, if only to illustrate the law that \u00c6sop always begins his career as a political weapon in a new home.",
        "When a selection of the Fables were translated into Chinese in 1840 they became favourite reading with the officials, till a high dignitary said, \u201cThis is clearly directed against _us_,\u201d and ordered \u00c6sop to be included in the Chinese _Index Expurgatorius_ (R.",
        "Morris, _Cont.",
        "Rev_.",
        "xxxix.",
        "731).",
        "We may conclude this history of \u00c6sop with a similar account of the progress of \u00c6sopic investigation.",
        "First came collection; the Greek \u00c6sop was brought together by Neveletus in 1610, the Latin by Nilant in 1709.",
        "The main truth about the former was laid down by the master hand of Bentley during a skirmish in the Battle of the Books; the equally great critic Lessing began to unravel the many knotty points connected with the medieval Latin \u00c6sop.",
        "His investigations have been carried on and completed by three Frenchmen in the present century, Robert, Du M\u00e9ril, and Hervieux; while three Germans, Crusius, Benfey, and Mall, have thrown much needed light on Babrius, on the Oriental \u00c6sop, and on Marie de France.",
        "Lastly, I have myself brought together these various lines of inquiry, and by adding a few threads of my own, have been able to weave them all for the first time into a consistent pattern.[6] [6] _The Fables of \u00c6sop, as first printed by William Caxton in_ 1484, _now again edited and induced by Joseph Jacobs_ (London, 1889), 2 vols., the first containing a History of the \u00c6sopic Fable.",
        "So much for the past of the Fable.",
        "Has it a future as a mode of literary expression? Scarcely; its method is at once too simple and too roundabout.",
        "Too roundabout; for the truths we have to tell we prefer to speak out directly and not by way of allegory.",
        "And the truths the Fable has to teach are too simple to correspond to the facts of our complex civilisation; its rude _graffiti_ of human nature cannot reproduce the subtle gradations of modern life.",
        "But as we all pass through in our lives the various stages of ancestral culture, there comes a time when these rough sketches of life have their appeal to us as they had for our forefathers.",
        "The allegory gives us a pleasing and not too strenuous stimulation of the intellectual powers; the lesson is not too complicated for childlike minds.",
        "Indeed, in their grotesque grace, in their quaint humour, in their trust in the simpler virtues, in their insight into the cruder vices, in their innocence of the fact of sex, \u00c6sop\u2019s Fables are as little children.",
        "They are as little children, and for that reason they will for ever find a home in the heaven of little children\u2019s souls.",
        "Aesop\u2019s Fables The Cock and the Pearl A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shinning amid the straw.",
        "\u201cHo! ho!\u201d quoth he, \u201cthat\u2019s for me,\u201d and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw.",
        "\u201cWhat did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? \u201cYou may be a treasure,\u201d quoth Master Cock, \u201cto men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley corn than a peck of pearls.\u201d Precious things are for those that can prize them.",
        "The Wolf and the Lamb Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just beginning to drink a little lower down.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s my supper,\u201d thought he, \u201cif only I can find some excuse to seize it.\u201d Then he called out to the Lamb, \u201cHow dare you muddle the water from which I am drinking?\u201d \u201cNay, master, nay,\u201d said Lambikin; \u201cif the water be muddy up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from you to me.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d said the Wolf, \u201cwhy did you call me bad names this time last year?\u201d \u201cThat cannot be,\u201d said the Lamb; \u201cI am only six months old.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d snarled the Wolf; \u201cif it was not you it was your father;\u201d and with that he rushed upon the poor little Lamb and WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA WARRA ate her all up.",
        "But before she died she gasped out\u2014 \u201cAny excuse will serve a tyrant.\u201d The Dog and the Shadow It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.",
        "Now on his way home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.",
        "As he crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the water beneath.",
        "Thinking it was another dog with another piece of meat, he made up his mind to have that also.",
        "So he made a snap at the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.",
        "Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.",
        "The Lion\u2019s Share The Lion went once a hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal, and the Wolf.",
        "They hunted and they hunted till at last they surprised a Stag, and soon took its life.",
        "Then came the question how the spoil should be divided.",
        "\u201cQuarter me this Stag,\u201d roared the Lion; so the other animals skinned it and cut it into four parts.",
        "Then the Lion took his stand in front of the carcass and pronounced judgment: The first quarter is for me in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as arbiter; another share comes to me for my part in the chase; and as for the fourth quarter, well, as for that, I should like to see which of you will dare to lay a paw upon it.\u201d \u201cHumph,\u201d grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his tail between his legs; but he spoke in a low growl\u2014 \u201cYou may share the labours of the great, but you will not share the spoil.\u201d The Wolf and the Crane A Wolf had been gorging on an animal he had killed, when suddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he could not swallow it.",
        "He soon felt terrible pain in his throat, and ran up and down groaning and groaning and seeking for something to relieve the pain.",
        "He tried to induce every one he met to remove the bone.",
        "\u201cI would give anything,\u201d said he, \u201cif you would take it out.\u201d At last the Crane agreed to try, and told the Wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws as wide as he could.",
        "Then the Crane put its long neck down the Wolf\u2019s throat, and with its beak loosened the bone, till at last it got it out.",
        "\u201cWill you kindly give me the reward you promised?\u201d said the Crane.",
        "The Wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said: \u201cBe content.",
        "You have put your head inside a Wolf\u2019s mouth and taken it out again in safety; that ought to be reward enough for you.\u201d Gratitude and greed go not together.",
        "The Man and the Serpent A Countryman\u2019s son by accident trod upon a Serpent\u2019s tail, which turned and bit him so that he died.",
        "The father in a rage got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of its tail.",
        "So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of the Farmer\u2019s cattle and caused him severe loss.",
        "Well, the Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent, and brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to it: \u201cLet\u2019s forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish my son, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was right in trying to revenge him; now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Serpent; \u201ctake away your gifts; you can never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail.\u201d Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.",
        "The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country.",
        "He was rough and ready, this cousin, but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome.",
        "Beans and bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them freely.",
        "The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare, and said: \u201cI cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live.",
        "When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life.\u201d No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the Town Mouse\u2019s residence late at night.",
        "\u201cYou will want some refreshment after our long journey,\u201d said the polite Town Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining room.",
        "There they found the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice.",
        "Suddenly they heard growling and barking.",
        "\u201cWhat is that?\u201d said the Country Mouse.",
        "\u201cIt is only the dogs of the house,\u201d answered the other.",
        "\u201cOnly!\u201d said the Country Mouse.",
        "\u201cI do not like that music at my dinner.\u201d Just at that moment the door flew open, in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run off.",
        "\u201cGood bye, Cousin,\u201d said the Country Mouse.",
        "\u201cWhat! going so soon?\u201d said the other.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d he replied; \u201cBetter beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear.\u201d The Fox and the Crow A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s for me, as I am a Fox,\u201d said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.",
        "\u201cGood day, Mistress Crow,\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cHow well you are looking to day: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye.",
        "I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.\u201d The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Fox.",
        "\u201cThat will do,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cThat was all I wanted.",
        "In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future\u2014 \u201cDo not trust flatterers.\u201d The Flatter doth rob by stealth, His victim, both of Wit and Wealth.",
        "The Sick Lion A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto death at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath.",
        "The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he grew more and more helpless.",
        "When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: \u201cNow is the time to pay off old grudges.\u201d So the Boar came up and drove at him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns; still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the Ass, feeling quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to the Lion kicked up his heels into his face.",
        "\u201cThis is a double death,\u201d growled the Lion.",
        "Only cowards insult dying majesty.",
        "The Ass and the Lapdog A Farmer one day came to the stables to see to his beasts of burden: among them was his favourite Ass, that was always well fed and often carried his master.",
        "With the Farmer came his Lapdog, who danced about and licked his hand and frisked about as happy as could be.",
        "The Farmer felt in his pocket, gave the Lapdog some dainty food, and sat down while he gave his orders to his servants.",
        "The Lapdog jumped into his master\u2019s lap, and lay there blinking while the Farmer stroked his ears.",
        "The Ass, seeing this, broke loose from his halter and commenced prancing about in imitation of the Lapdog.",
        "The Farmer could not hold his sides with laughter, so the Ass went up to him, and putting his feet upon the Farmer\u2019s shoulder attempted to climb into his lap.",
        "The Farmer\u2019s servants rushed up with sticks and pitchforks and soon taught the Ass that Clumsy jesting is no joke.",
        "The Lion and the Mouse Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.",
        "\u201cPardon, O King,\u201d cried the little Mouse: \u201cforgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?\u201d The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.",
        "Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on.",
        "Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.",
        "\u201cWas I not right?\u201d said the little Mouse.",
        "Little friends may prove great friends.",
        "The Swallow and the Other Birds It happened that a Countryman was sowing some hemp seeds in a field where a Swallow and some other birds were hopping about picking up their food.",
        "\u201cBeware of that man,\u201d quoth the Swallow.",
        "\u201cWhy, what is he doing?\u201d said the others.",
        "\u201cThat is hemp seed he is sowing; be careful to pick up every one of the seeds, or else you will repent it.\u201d The birds paid no heed to the Swallow\u2019s words, and by and by the hemp grew up and was made into cord, and of the cords nets were made, and many a bird that had despised the Swallow\u2019s advice was caught in nets made out of that very hemp.",
        "\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d said the Swallow.",
        "Destroy the seed of evil, or it will grow up to your ruin.",
        "The Frogs Desiring a King The Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy swamp that just suited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody troubling with them.",
        "But some of them thought that this was not right, that they should have a king and a proper constitution, so they determined to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted.",
        "\u201cMighty Jove,\u201d they cried, \u201csend unto us a king that will rule over us and keep us in order.\u201d Jove laughed at their croaking, and threw down into the swamp a huge Log, which came down splashing into the swamp.",
        "The Frogs were frightened out of their lives by the commotion made in their midst, and all rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two of the boldest of them ventured out towards the Log, and even dared to touch it; still it did not move.",
        "Then the greatest hero of the Frogs jumped upon the Log and commenced dancing up and down upon it, thereupon all the Frogs came and did the same; and for some time the Frogs went about their business every day without taking the slightest notice of their new King Log lying in their midst.",
        "But this did not suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, and said to him, \u201cWe want a real king; one that will really rule over us.\u201d Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big Stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up.",
        "Then the Frogs repented when too late.",
        "Better no rule than cruel rule.",
        "The Mountains in Labour One day the Countrymen noticed that the Mountains were in labour; smoke came out of their summits, the earth was quaking at their feet, trees were crashing, and huge rocks were tumbling.",
        "They felt sure that something horrible was going to happen.",
        "They all gathered together in one place to see what terrible thing this could be.",
        "They waited and they waited, but nothing came.",
        "At last there was a still more violent earthquake, and a huge gap appeared in the side of the Mountains.",
        "They all fell down upon their knees and waited.",
        "At last, and at last, a teeny, tiny mouse poked its little head and bristles out of the gap and came running down towards them, and ever after they used to say: \u201cMuch outcry, little outcome.\u201d The Hares and the Frogs The Hares were so persecuted by the other beasts, they did not know where to go.",
        "As soon as they saw a single animal approach them, off they used to run.",
        "One day they saw a troop of wild Horses stampeding about, and in quite a panic all the Hares scuttled off to a lake hard by, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear.",
        "But just as they got near the bank of the lake, a troop of Frogs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Hares scuttled off, and jumped into the water.",
        "\u201cTruly,\u201d said one of the Hares, \u201cthings are not so bad as they seem: \u201cThere is always someone worse off than yourself.\u201d The Wolf and the Kid A Kid was perched up on the top of a house, and looking down saw a Wolf passing under him.",
        "Immediately he began to revile and attack his enemy.",
        "\u201cMurderer and thief,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhat do you here near honest folks\u2019 houses? How dare you make an appearance where your vile deeds are known?\u201d \u201cCurse away, my young friend,\u201d said the Wolf.",
        "\u201cIt is easy to be brave from a safe distance.\u201d The Woodman and the Serpent One wintry day a Woodman was tramping home from his work when he saw something black lying on the snow.",
        "When he came closer he saw it was a Serpent to all appearance dead.",
        "But he took it up and put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home.",
        "As soon as he got indoors he put the Serpent down on the hearth before the fire.",
        "The children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again.",
        "Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but the Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death.",
        "So the Woodman seized his axe, and with one stroke cut the Serpent in two.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cNo gratitude from the wicked.\u201d The Bald Man and the Fly There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summer\u2019s day.",
        "A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time.",
        "The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but\u2014_whack_\u2014his palm came on his head instead; again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and said: \u201cYou will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies.\u201d The Fox and the Stork At one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemed very good friends.",
        "So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish.",
        "This the Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end of her long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began.",
        "\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cthe soup is not to your liking.\u201d \u201cPray do not apologise,\u201d said the Stork.",
        "\u201cI hope you will return this visit, and come and dine with me soon.\u201d So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but when they were seated at table all that was for their dinner was contained in a very long necked jar with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox could not insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was to lick the outside of the jar.",
        "\u201cI will not apologise for the dinner,\u201d said the Stork: \u201cOne bad turn deserves another.\u201d The Fox and the Mask A Fox had by some means got into the store room of a theatre.",
        "Suddenly he observed a face glaring down on him and began to be very frightened; but looking more closely he found it was only a Mask such as actors use to put over their face.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cyou look very fine; it is a pity you have not got any brains.\u201d Outside show is a poor substitute for inner worth.",
        "The Jay and the Peacock A Jay venturing into a yard where Peacocks used to walk, found there a number of feathers which had fallen from the Peacocks when they were moulting.",
        "He tied them all to his tail and strutted down towards the Peacocks.",
        "When he came near them they soon discovered the cheat, and striding up to him pecked at him and plucked away his borrowed plumes.",
        "So the Jay could do no better than go back to the other Jays, who had watched his behaviour from a distance; but they were equally annoyed with him, and told him: \u201cIt is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.\u201d The Frog and the Ox \u201cOh Father,\u201d said a little Frog to the big one sitting by the side of a pool, \u201cI have seen such a terrible monster! It was as big as a mountain, with horns on its head, and a long tail, and it had hoofs divided in two.\u201d \u201cTush, child, tush,\u201d said the old Frog, \u201cthat was only Farmer White\u2019s Ox.",
        "It isn\u2019t so big either; he may be a little bit taller than I, but I could easily make myself quite as broad; just you see.\u201d So he blew himself out, and blew himself out, and blew himself out.",
        "\u201cWas he as big as that?\u201d asked he.",
        "\u201cOh, much bigger than that,\u201d said the young Frog.",
        "Again the old one blew himself out, and asked the young one if the Ox was as big as that.",
        "\u201cBigger, father, bigger,\u201d was the reply.",
        "So the Frog took a deep breath, and blew and blew and blew, and swelled and swelled and swelled.",
        "And then he said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the Ox is not as big as this.",
        "But at this moment he burst.",
        "Self conceit may lead to self destruction.",
        "Androcles A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled to the forest.",
        "As he was wandering about there he came upon a Lion lying down moaning and groaning.",
        "At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him.",
        "As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain.",
        "He pulled out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog.",
        "Then the Lion took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live.",
        "But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several days.",
        "The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle, and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena.",
        "Soon the Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim.",
        "But as soon as he came near to Androcles he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog.",
        "The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned Androcles to him, who told him the whole story.",
        "Whereupon the slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native forest.",
        "Gratitude is the sign of noble souls.",
        "The Bat, the Birds, and the Beasts A great conflict was about to come off between the Birds and the Beasts.",
        "When the two armies were collected together the Bat hesitated which to join.",
        "The Birds that passed his perch said: \u201cCome with us\u201d; but he said: \u201cI am a Beast.\u201d Later on, some Beasts who were passing underneath him looked up and said: \u201cCome with us\u201d; but he said: \u201cI am a Bird.\u201d Luckily at the last moment peace was made, and no battle took place, so the Bat came to the Birds and wished to join in the rejoicings, but they all turned against him and he had to fly away.",
        "He then went to the Beasts, but soon had to beat a retreat, or else they would have torn him to pieces.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d said the Bat, \u201cI see now, \u201cHe that is neither one thing nor the other has no friends.\u201d The Hart and the Hunter The Hart was once drinking from a pool and admiring the noble figure he made there.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cwhere can you see such noble horns as these, with such antlers! I wish I had legs more worthy to bear such a noble crown; it is a pity they are so slim and slight.\u201d At that moment a Hunter approached and sent an arrow whistling after him.",
        "Away bounded the Hart, and soon, by the aid of his nimble legs, was nearly out of sight of the Hunter; but not noticing where he was going, he passed under some trees with branches growing low down in which his antlers were caught, so that the Hunter had time to come up.",
        "\u201cAlas! alas!\u201d cried the Hart: \u201cWe often despise what is most useful to us.\u201d The Serpent and the File A Serpent in the course of its wanderings came into an armourer\u2019s shop.",
        "As he glided over the floor he felt his skin pricked by a file lying there.",
        "In a rage he turned round upon it and tried to dart his fangs into it; but he could do no harm to heavy iron and had soon to give over his wrath.",
        "It is useless attacking the insensible.",
        "The Man and the Wood A Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and begged all the Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular purpose.",
        "The Trees were good natured and gave him one of their branches.",
        "What did the Man do but fix it into the axe head, and soon set to work cutting down tree after tree.",
        "Then the Trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves.",
        "The Dog and the Wolf A gaunt Wolf was almost dead with hunger when he happened to meet a House dog who was passing by.",
        "\u201cAh, Cousin,\u201d said the Dog.",
        "\u201cI knew how it would be; your irregular life will soon be the ruin of you.",
        "Why do you not work steadily as I do, and get your food regularly given to you?\u201d \u201cI would have no objection,\u201d said the Wolf, \u201cif I could only get a place.\u201d \u201cI will easily arrange that for you,\u201d said the Dog; \u201ccome with me to my master and you shall share my work.\u201d So the Wolf and the Dog went towards the town together.",
        "On the way there the Wolf noticed that the hair on a certain part of the Dog\u2019s neck was very much worn away, so he asked him how that had come about.",
        "\u201cOh, it is nothing,\u201d said the Dog.",
        "\u201cThat is only the place where the collar is put on at night to keep me chained up; it chafes a bit, but one soon gets used to it.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d said the Wolf.",
        "\u201cThen good bye to you, Master Dog.\u201d Better starve free than be a fat slave.",
        "The Belly and the Members One fine day it occurred to the Members of the Body that they were doing all the work and the Belly was having all the food.",
        "So they held a meeting, and after a long discussion, decided to strike work till the Belly consented to take its proper share of the work.",
        "So for a day or two, the Hands refused to take the food, the Mouth refused to receive it, and the Teeth had no work to do.",
        "But after a day or two the Members began to find that they themselves were not in a very active condition: the Hands could hardly move, and the Mouth was all parched and dry, while the Legs were unable to support the rest.",
        "So thus they found that even the Belly in its dull quiet way was doing necessary work for the Body, and that all must work together or the Body will go to pieces.",
        "The Hart in the Ox Stall A Hart hotly pursued by the hounds fled for refuge into an ox stall, and buried itself in a truss of hay, leaving nothing to be seen but the tips of his horns.",
        "Soon after the Hunters came up and asked if any one had seen the Hart.",
        "The stable boys, who had been resting after their dinner, looked round, but could see nothing, and the Hunters went away.",
        "Shortly afterwards the master came in, and looking round, saw that something unusual had taken place.",
        "He pointed to the truss of hay and said: \u201cWhat are those two curious things sticking out of the hay?\u201d And when the stable boys came to look they discovered the Hart, and soon made an end of him.",
        "He thus learnt that Nothing escapes the master\u2019s eye.",
        "The Fox and the Grapes One hot summer\u2019s day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been trained over a lofty branch.",
        "\u201cJust the thing to quench my thirst,\u201d quoth he.",
        "Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and just missed the bunch.",
        "Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he jumped up, but with no greater success.",
        "Again and again he tried after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked away with his nose in the air, saying: \u201cI am sure they are sour.\u201d It is easy to despise what you cannot get.",
        "The Peacock and Juno A Peacock once placed a petition before Juno desiring to have the voice of a nightingale in addition to his other attractions; but Juno refused his request.",
        "When he persisted, and pointed out that he was her favourite bird, she said: \u201cBe content with your lot; one cannot be first in everything.\u201d The Horse, Hunter, and Stag A quarrel had arisen between the Horse and the Stag, so the Horse came to a Hunter to ask his help to take revenge on the Stag.",
        "The Hunter agreed, but said: \u201cIf you desire to conquer the Stag, you must permit me to place this piece of iron between your jaws, so that I may guide you with these reins, and allow this saddle to be placed upon your back so that I may keep steady upon you as we follow after the enemy.\u201d The Horse agreed to the conditions, and the Hunter soon saddled and bridled him.",
        "Then with the aid of the Hunter the Horse soon overcame the Stag, and said to the Hunter: \u201cNow, get off, and remove those things from my mouth and back.\u201d \u201cNot so fast, friend,\u201d said the Hunter.",
        "\u201cI have now got you under bit and spur, and prefer to keep you as you are at present.\u201d If you allow men to use you for your own purposes, they will use you for theirs.",
        "The Fox and the Lion When first the Fox saw the Lion he was terribly frightened, and ran away and hid himself in the wood.",
        "Next time however he came near the King of Beasts he stopped at a safe distance and watched him pass by.",
        "The third time they came near one another the Fox went straight up to the Lion and passed the time of day with him, asking him how his family were, and when he should have the pleasure of seeing him again; then turning his tail, he parted from the Lion without much ceremony.",
        "Familiarity breeds contempt.",
        "The Lion and the Statue A Man and a Lion were discussing the relative strength of men and lions in general.",
        "The Man contended that he and his fellows were stronger than lions by reason of their greater intelligence.",
        "\u201cCome now with me,\u201d he cried, \u201cand I will soon prove that I am right.\u201d So he took him into the public gardens and showed him a statue of Hercules overcoming the Lion and tearing his mouth in two.",
        "\u201cThat is all very well,\u201d said the Lion, \u201cbut proves nothing, for it was a man who made the statue.\u201d We can easily represent things as we wish them to be.",
        "The Ant and the Grasshopper In a field one summer\u2019s day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart\u2019s content.",
        "An Ant passed by, bearing along with great toil an ear of corn he was taking to the nest.",
        "\u201cWhy not come and chat with me,\u201d said the Grasshopper, \u201cinstead of toiling and moiling in that way?\u201d \u201cI am helping to lay up food for the winter,\u201d said the Ant, \u201cand recommend you to do the same.\u201d \u201cWhy bother about winter?\u201d said the Grasshopper; we have got plenty of food at present.\u201d But the Ant went on its way and continued its toil.",
        "When the winter came the Grasshopper had no food and found itself dying of hunger, while it saw the ants distributing every day corn and grain from the stores they had collected in the summer.",
        "Then the Grasshopper knew: It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.",
        "The Tree and the Reed \u201cWell, little one,\u201d said a Tree to a Reed that was growing at its foot, \u201cwhy do you not plant your feet deeply in the ground, and raise your head boldly in the air as I do?\u201d \u201cI am contented with my lot,\u201d said the Reed.",
        "\u201cI may not be so grand, but I think I am safer.\u201d \u201cSafe!\u201d sneered the Tree.",
        "\u201cWho shall pluck me up by the roots or bow my head to the ground?\u201d But it soon had to repent of its boasting, for a hurricane arose which tore it up from its roots, and cast it a useless log on the ground, while the little Reed, bending to the force of the wind, soon stood upright again when the storm had passed over.",
        "Obscurity often brings safety.",
        "The Fox and the Cat A Fox was boasting to a Cat of its clever devices for escaping its enemies.",
        "\u201cI have a whole bag of tricks,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich contains a hundred ways of escaping my enemies.\u201d \u201cI have only one,\u201d said the Cat; \u201cbut I can generally manage with that.\u201d Just at that moment they heard the cry of a pack of hounds coming towards them, and the Cat immediately scampered up a tree and hid herself in the boughs.",
        "\u201cThis is my plan,\u201d said the Cat.",
        "\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d The Fox thought first of one way, then of another, and while he was debating the hounds came nearer and nearer, and at last the Fox in his confusion was caught up by the hounds and soon killed by the huntsmen.",
        "Miss Puss, who had been looking on, said: \u201cBetter one safe way than a hundred on which you cannot reckon.\u201d The Wolf in Sheep\u2019s Clothing A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs.",
        "But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep.",
        "The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep\u2019s clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.",
        "Appearances are deceptive.",
        "The Dog in the Manger A Dog looking out for its afternoon nap jumped into the Manger of an Ox and lay there cosily upon the straw.",
        "But soon the Ox, returning from its afternoon work, came up to the Manger and wanted to eat some of the straw.",
        "The Dog in a rage, being awakened from its slumber, stood up and barked at the Ox, and whenever it came near attempted to bite it.",
        "At last the Ox had to give up the hope of getting at the straw, and went away muttering: \u201cAh, people often grudge others what they cannot enjoy themselves.\u201d The Man and the Wooden God In the old days men used to worship sticks and stones and idols, and prayed to them to give them luck.",
        "It happened that a Man had often prayed to a wooden idol he had received from his father, but his luck never seemed to change.",
        "He prayed and he prayed, but still he remained as unlucky as ever.",
        "One day in the greatest rage he went to the Wooden God, and with one blow swept it down from its pedestal.",
        "The idol broke in two, and what did he see? An immense number of coins flying all over the place.",
        "The Fisher A Fisher once took his bagpipes to the bank of a river, and played upon them with the hope of making the fish rise; but never a one put his nose out of the water.",
        "So he cast his net into the river and soon drew it forth filled with fish.",
        "Then he took his bagpipes again, and, as he played, the fish leapt up in the net.",
        "\u201cAh, you dance now when I play,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said an old Fish: \u201cWhen you are in a man\u2019s power you must do as he bids you.\u201d The Shepherd\u2019s Boy There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest.",
        "It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement.",
        "He rushed down towards the village calling out \u201cWolf, Wolf,\u201d and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time.",
        "This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help.",
        "But shortly after this a Wolf actually did come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out \u201cWolf, Wolf,\u201d still louder than before.",
        "But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help.",
        "So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy\u2019s flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said: \u201cA liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.\u201d The Young Thief and His Mother A young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it.",
        "He expressed his desire to see his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of course this was granted.",
        "When his Mother came to him he said: \u201cI want to whisper to you,\u201d and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off.",
        "All the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct.",
        "\u201cIt is to punish her,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWhen I was young I began with stealing little things, and brought them home to Mother.",
        "Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and said: \u201cIt will not be noticed.\u201d It is because of her that I am here to day.\u201d \u201cHe is right, woman,\u201d said the Priest; \u201cthe Lord hath said: \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart therefrom.\u201d The Man and His Two Wives In the old days, when men were allowed to have many wives, a middle aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young; each loved him very much, and desired to see him like herself.",
        "Now the Man\u2019s hair was turning grey, which the young Wife did not like, as it made him look too old for her husband.",
        "So every night she used to comb his hair and pick out the white ones.",
        "But the elder Wife saw her husband growing grey with great pleasure, for she did not like to be mistaken for his mother.",
        "So every morning she used to arrange his hair and pick out as many of the black ones as she could.",
        "The consequence was the Man soon found himself entirely bald.",
        "Yield to all and you will soon have nothing to yield.",
        "The Nurse and the Wolf \u201cBe quiet now,\u201d said an old Nurse to a child sitting on her lap.",
        "\u201cIf you make that noise again I will throw you to the Wolf.\u201d Now it chanced that a Wolf was passing close under the window as this was said.",
        "So he crouched down by the side of the house and waited.",
        "\u201cI am in good luck to day,\u201d thought he.",
        "\u201cIt is sure to cry soon, and a daintier morsel I haven\u2019t had for many a long day.\u201d So he waited, and he waited, and he waited, till at last the child began to cry, and the Wolf came forward before the window, and looked up to the Nurse, wagging his tail.",
        "But all the Nurse did was to shut down the window and call for help, and the dogs of the house came rushing out.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d said the Wolf as he galloped away, \u201cEnemies\u2019 promises were made to be broken.\u201d The Tortoise and the Birds A Tortoise desired to change its place of residence, so he asked an Eagle to carry him to his new home, promising her a rich reward for her trouble.",
        "The Eagle agreed and seizing the Tortoise by the shell with her talons soared aloft.",
        "On their way they met a Crow, who said to the Eagle: \u201cTortoise is good eating.\u201d \u201cThe shell is too hard,\u201d said the Eagle in reply.",
        "\u201cThe rocks will soon crack the shell,\u201d was the Crow\u2019s answer; and the Eagle, taking the hint, let fall the Tortoise on a sharp rock, and the two birds made a hearty meal of the Tortoise.",

        "The Two Crabs One fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a stroll on the sand.",
        "\u201cChild,\u201d said the mother, \u201cyou are walking very ungracefully.",
        "You should accustom yourself, to walking straight forward without twisting from side to side.\u201d \u201cPray, mother,\u201d said the young one, \u201cdo but set the example yourself, and I will follow you.\u201d Example is the best precept.",
        "The Ass in the Lion\u2019s Skin An Ass once found a Lion\u2019s skin which the hunters had left out in the sun to dry.",
        "He put it on and went towards his native village.",
        "All fled at his approach, both men and animals, and he was a proud Ass that day.",
        "In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed, but then every one knew him, and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the fright he had caused.",
        "And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said: \u201cAh, I knew you by your voice.\u201d Fine clothes may disguise, but silly words will disclose a fool.",
        "The Two Fellows and the Bear Two Fellows were travelling together through a wood, when a Bear rushed out upon them.",
        "One of the travellers happened to be in front, and he seized hold of the branch of a tree, and hid himself among the leaves.",
        "The other, seeing no help for it, threw himself flat down upon the ground, with his face in the dust.",
        "The Bear, coming up to him, put his muzzle close to his ear, and sniffed and sniffed.",
        "But at last with a growl he shook his head and slouched off, for bears will not touch dead meat.",
        "Then the fellow in the tree came down to his comrade, and, laughing, said \u201cWhat was it that Master Bruin whispered to you?\u201d \u201cHe told me,\u201d said the other, \u201cNever trust a friend who deserts you at a pinch.\u201d The Two Pots Two Pots had been left on the bank of a river, one of brass, and one of earthenware.",
        "When the tide rose they both floated off down the stream.",
        "Now the earthenware pot tried its best to keep aloof from the brass one, which cried out: \u201cFear nothing, friend, I will not strike you.\u201d \u201cBut I may come in contact with you,\u201d said the other, \u201cif I come too close; and whether I hit you, or you hit me, I shall suffer for it.\u201d The strong and the weak cannot keep company.",
        "The Four Oxen and the Lion A Lion used to prowl about a field in which Four Oxen used to dwell.",
        "Many a time he tried to attack them; but whenever he came near they turned their tails to one another, so that whichever way he approached them he was met by the horns of one of them.",
        "At last, however, they fell a quarrelling among themselves, and each went off to pasture alone in a separate corner of the field.",
        "Then the Lion attacked them one by one and soon made an end of all four.",

        "Avaricious and Envious Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts\u2019 desire.",
        "Now the one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy.",
        "So to punish them both, Jupiter granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his neighbour had twice as much.",
        "The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold.",
        "No sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal.",
        "Then came the turn of the Envious man, who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all.",

        "\u201cMy hands are numb with the cold,\u201d said the Man, \u201cand my breath warms them.\u201d After this they arrived at the Satyr\u2019s home, and soon the Satyr put a smoking dish of porridge before him.",
        "But when the Man raised his spoon to his mouth he began blowing upon it.",
        "\u201cAnd what do you do that for?\u201d said the Satyr.",

        "But he took it home on second thoughts, and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold.",
        "Every morning the same thing occurred, and he soon became rich by selling his eggs.",

        "But at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them.",
        "When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails.",
        "He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another.",
        "He failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance.",
        "\u201cThat is all very well,\u201d said one of the older foxes; \u201cbut I do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself.\u201d Distrust interested advice.",
        "The One Eyed Doe A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and could not see any one approaching her on that side.",
        "So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea, with her sound eye looking towards the land.",
        "By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land, and often escaped by this means.",
        "But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye, and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d cried she with her dying voice, \u201cYou cannot escape your fate.\u201d Belling the Cat Long ago, the mice had a general council to consider what measures they could take to outwit their common enemy, the Cat.",
        "Some said this, and some said that; but at last a young mouse got up and said he had a proposal to make, which he thought would meet the case.",
        "\u201cYou will all agree,\u201d said he, \u201cthat our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us.",
        "Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her.",
        "I venture, therefore, to propose that a small bell be procured, and attached by a ribbon round the neck of the Cat.",
        "By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood.\u201d This proposal met with general applause, until an old mouse got up and said: \u201cThat is all very well, but who is to bell the Cat?\u201d The mice looked at one another and nobody spoke.",
        "Then the old mouse said: \u201cIt is easy to propose impossible remedies.\u201d The Hare and the Tortoise The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals.",
        "\u201cI have never yet been beaten,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen I put forth my full speed.",
        "I challenge any one here to race with me.\u201d The Tortoise said quietly, \u201cI accept your challenge.\u201d \u201cThat is a good joke,\u201d said the Hare; \u201cI could dance round you all the way.\u201d \u201cKeep your boasting till you\u2019ve beaten,\u201d answered the Tortoise.",
        "\u201cShall we race?\u201d So a course was fixed and a start was made.",
        "The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap.",
        "The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning post and could not run up in time to save the race.",
        "Then said the Tortoise: \u201cPlodding wins the race.\u201d The Old Man and Death An old labourer, bent double with age and toil, was gathering sticks in a forest.",
        "At last he grew so tired and hopeless that he threw down the bundle of sticks, and cried out: \u201cI cannot bear this life any longer.",
        "Ah, I wish Death would only come and take me!\u201d As he spoke, Death, a grisly skeleton, appeared and said to him: \u201cWhat wouldst thou, Mortal? I heard thee call me.\u201d \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied the woodcutter, \u201cwould you kindly help me to lift this faggot of sticks on to my shoulder?\u201d We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified.",
        "The Hare With Many Friends A Hare was very popular with the other beasts who all claimed to be her friends.",
        "But one day she heard the hounds approaching and hoped to escape them by the aid of her many Friends.",
        "So, she went to the horse, and asked him to carry her away from the hounds on his back.",
        "But he declined, stating that he had important work to do for his master.",
        "\u201cHe felt sure,\u201d he said, \u201cthat all her other friends would come to her assistance.\u201d She then applied to the bull, and hoped that he would repel the hounds with his horns.",
        "The bull replied: \u201cI am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the goat will do what you want.\u201d The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it.",
        "The ram, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to.",
        "So she went to the ram and told him the case.",
        "The ram replied: \u201cAnother time, my dear friend.",
        "I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares.\u201d The Hare then applied, as a last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task.",
        "By this time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped.",
        "He that has many friends, has no friends.",
        "The Lion in Love A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents.",
        "The old people did not know what to say.",
        "They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.",
        "At last the father said: \u201cWe feel highly honoured by your Majesty\u2019s proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury.",
        "Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider your proposal again.\u201d The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out.",
        "But when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst.",
        "Love can tame the wildest.",
        "The Bundle of Sticks An old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him to give them some parting advice.",
        "He ordered his servants to bring in a faggot of sticks, and said to his eldest son: \u201cBreak it.\u201d The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts was unable to break the Bundle.",
        "The other sons also tried, but none of them was successful.",
        "\u201cUntie the faggots,\u201d said the father, \u201cand each of you take a stick.\u201d When they had done so, he called out to them: \u201cNow, break,\u201d and each stick was easily broken.",
        "\u201cYou see my meaning,\u201d said their father.",
        "Union gives strength.",
        "The Lion, the Fox, and the Beasts The Lion once gave out that he was sick unto death and summoned the animals to come and hear his last Will and Testament.",
        "So the Goat came to the Lion\u2019s cave, and stopped there listening for a long time.",
        "Then a Sheep went in, and before she came out a Calf came up to receive the last wishes of the Lord of the Beasts.",
        "But soon the Lion seemed to recover, and came to the mouth of his cave, and saw the Fox, who had been waiting outside for some time.",
        "\u201cWhy do you not come to pay your respects to me?\u201d said the Lion to the Fox.",
        "\u201cI beg your Majesty\u2019s pardon,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cbut I noticed the track of the animals that have already come to you; and while I see many hoof marks going in, I see none coming out.",
        "Till the animals that have entered your cave come out again I prefer to remain in the open air.\u201d It is easier to get into the enemy\u2019s toils than out again.",
        "The Ass\u2019s Brains The Lion and the Fox went hunting together.",
        "The Lion, on the advice of the Fox, sent a message to the Ass, proposing to make an alliance between their two families.",
        "The Ass came to the place of meeting, overjoyed at the prospect of a royal alliance.",
        "But when he came there the Lion simply pounced on the Ass, and said to the Fox: \u201cHere is our dinner for to day.",
        "Watch you here while I go and have a nap.",
        "Woe betide you if you touch my prey.\u201d The Lion went away and the Fox waited; but finding that his master did not return, ventured to take out the brains of the Ass and ate them up.",
        "When the Lion came back he soon noticed the absence of the brains, and asked the Fox in a terrible voice: \u201cWhat have you done with the brains?\u201d \u201cBrains, your Majesty! it had none, or it would never have fallen into your trap.\u201d Wit has always an answer ready.",
        "The Eagle and the Arrow An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death.",
        "Slowly it fluttered down to the earth, with its life blood pouring out of it.",
        "Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced, it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one of its own plumes.",
        "\u201cAlas!\u201d it cried, as it died, \u201cWe often give our enemies the means for our own destruction.\u201d The Cat Maiden The gods were once disputing whether it was possible for a living being to change its nature.",
        "Jupiter said \u201cYes,\u201d but Venus said \u201cNo.\u201d So, to try the question, Jupiter turned a Cat into a Maiden, and gave her to a young man for a wife.",
        "The wedding was duly performed and the young couple sat down to the wedding feast.",
        "\u201cSee,\u201d said Jupiter, to Venus, \u201chow becomingly she behaves.",
        "Who could tell that yesterday she was but a Cat? Surely her nature is changed?\u201d \u201cWait a minute,\u201d replied Venus, and let loose a mouse into the room.",
        "No sooner did the bride see this than she jumped up from her seat and tried to pounce upon the mouse.",
        "\u201cAh, you see,\u201d said Venus, \u201cNature will out.\u201d The Milkmaid and Her Pail Patty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a Pail on her head.",
        "As she went along she began calculating what she would do with the money she would get for the milk.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll buy some fowls from Farmer Brown,\u201d said she, \u201cand they will lay eggs each morning, which I will sell to the parson\u2019s wife.",
        "With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs I\u2019ll buy myself a new dimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won\u2019t all the young men come up and speak to me! Polly Shaw will be that jealous; but I don\u2019t care.",
        "I shall just look at her and toss my head like this.",
        "As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.",
        "So she had to go home and tell her mother what had occurred.",
        "\u201cAh, my child,\u201d said the mother, \u201cDo not count your chickens before they are hatched.\u201d The Horse and the Ass A Horse and an Ass were travelling together, the Horse prancing along in its fine trappings, the Ass carrying with difficulty the heavy weight in its panniers.",
        "\u201cI wish I were you,\u201d sighed the Ass; \u201cnothing to do and well fed, and all that fine harness upon you.\u201d Next day, however, there was a great battle, and the Horse was wounded to death in the final charge of the day.",
        "His friend, the Ass, happened to pass by shortly afterwards and found him on the point of death.",
        "\u201cI was wrong,\u201d said the Ass: \u201cBetter humble security than gilded danger.\u201d The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner A Trumpeter during a battle ventured too near the enemy and was captured by them.",
        "They were about to proceed to put him to death when he begged them to hear his plea for mercy.",
        "\u201cI do not fight,\u201d said he, \u201cand indeed carry no weapon; I only blow this trumpet, and surely that cannot harm you; then why should you kill me?\u201d \u201cYou may not fight yourself,\u201d said the others, \u201cbut you encourage and guide your men to the fight.\u201d Words may be deeds.",
        "The Buffoon and the Countryman At a country fair there was a Buffoon who made all the people laugh by imitating the cries of various animals.",
        "He finished off by squeaking so like a pig that the spectators thought that he had a porker concealed about him.",
        "But a Countryman who stood by said: \u201cCall that a pig\u2019s squeak! Nothing like it.",
        "You give me till tomorrow and I will show you what it\u2019s like.\u201d The audience laughed, but next day, sure enough, the Countryman appeared on the stage, and putting his head down squealed so hideously that the spectators hissed and threw stones at him to make him stop.",
        "\u201cYou fools!\u201d he cried, \u201csee what you have been hissing,\u201d and held up a little pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter the squeals.",
        "Men often applaud an imitation and hiss the real thing.",
        "The Old Woman and the Wine Jar You must know that sometimes old women like a glass of wine.",
        "One of this sort once found a Wine jar lying in the road, and eagerly went up to it hoping to find it full.",
        "But when she took it up she found that all the wine had been drunk out of it.",
        "Still she took a long sniff at the mouth of the Jar.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d she cried, \u201cWhat memories cling \u2019round the instruments of our pleasure.\u201d The Fox and the Goat By an unlucky chance a Fox fell into a deep well from which he could not get out.",
        "A Goat passed by shortly afterwards, and asked the Fox what he was doing down there.",
        "\u201cOh, have you not heard?\u201d said the Fox; \u201cthere is going to be a great drought, so I jumped down here in order to be sure to have water by me.",
        "Why don\u2019t you come down too?\u201d The Goat thought well of this advice, and jumped down into the well.",
        "But the Fox immediately jumped on her back, and by putting his foot on her long horns managed to jump up to the edge of the well.",
        "\u201cGood bye, friend,\u201d said the Fox, \u201cremember next time, \u201cNever trust the advice of a man in difficulties.\u201d And this is the end of \u00c6sop\u2019s Fables.",
        "HURRAH! ."
