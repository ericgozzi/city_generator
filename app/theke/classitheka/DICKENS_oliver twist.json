TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter. For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country. Although I am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,\u2014a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter. As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, \u201cLet me see the child, and die.\u201d The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\u2019s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him: \u201cOh, you must not talk about dying yet.\u201d \u201cLor bless her dear heart, no!\u201d interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction. \u201cLor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on \u2019em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she\u2019ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there\u2019s a dear young lamb do.\u201d Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\u2019s prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child. The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back\u2014and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long. \u201cIt\u2019s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!\u201d said the surgeon at last. \u201cAh, poor dear, so it is!\u201d said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child. \u201cPoor dear!\u201d \u201cYou needn\u2019t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,\u201d said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.\u201d He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed side on his way to the door, added, \u201cShe was a good looking girl, too; where did she come from?\u201d \u201cShe was brought here last night,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cby the overseer\u2019s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.\u201d The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. \u201cThe old story,\u201d he said, shaking his head: \u201cno wedding ring, I see. Ah! Good night!\u201d The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant. What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once\u2014a parish child\u2014the orphan of a workhouse\u2014the humble, half starved drudge\u2014to be cuffed and buffeted through the world\u2014despised by all, and pitied by none. Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder. CHAPTER II. TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\u2019S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in \u201cthe house\u201d who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \u201cfarmed,\u201d or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence halfpenny\u2019s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher. Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this. Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing\u2014though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm\u2014the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have! It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist\u2019s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\u2019s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden gate. \u201cGoodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?\u201d said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well affected ecstasies of joy. \u201c(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \u2019em directly.)\u2014My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure ly!\u201d Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\u2019s. \u201cLor, only think,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, running out,\u2014for the three boys had been removed by this time,\u2014\u201conly think of that! That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.\u201d Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church warden, it by no means mollified the beadle. \u201cDo you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, \u201cto keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann with great humility. Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He relaxed. \u201cWell, well, Mrs. Mann,\u201d he replied in a calmer tone; \u201cit may be as you say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.\u201d Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled. \u201cNow don\u2019t you be offended at what I\u2019m a going to say,\u201d observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn\u2019t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?\u201d \u201cNot a drop. Nor a drop,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner. \u201cI think you will,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. \u201cJust a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\u201d Mr. Bumble coughed. \u201cNow, just a leetle drop,\u201d said Mrs. Mann persuasively. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d inquired the beadle. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s what I\u2019m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants\u2019 Daffy, when they ain\u2019t well, Mr. Bumble,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass. \u201cIt\u2019s gin. I\u2019ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It\u2019s gin.\u201d \u201cDo you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?\u201d inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing. \u201cAh, bless \u2019em, that I do, dear as it is,\u201d replied the nurse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see \u2019em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.\u201d \u201cNo\u201d; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; \u201cno, you could not. You are a humane woman, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (Here she set down the glass.) \u201cI shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (He drew it towards him.) \u201cYou feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.\u201d (He stirred the gin and water.) \u201cI\u2014I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann\u201d; and he swallowed half of it. \u201cAnd now about business,\u201d said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket book. \u201cThe child that was half baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old today.\u201d \u201cBless him!\u201d interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron. \u201cAnd notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat\u2019ral exertions on the part of this parish,\u201d said Bumble, \u201cwe have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother\u2019s settlement, name, or condition.\u201d Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment\u2019s reflection, \u201cHow comes he to have any name at all, then?\u201d The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, \u201cI inwented it.\u201d \u201cYou, Mr. Bumble!\u201d \u201cI, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last was a S,\u2014Swubble, I named him. This was a T,\u2014Twist, I named _him_. The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.\u201d \u201cWhy, you\u2019re quite a literary character, sir!\u201d said Mrs. Mann. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; \u201cperhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.\u201d He finished the gin and water, and added, \u201cOliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll fetch him directly,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress. \u201cMake a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,\u201d said Mrs. Mann. Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table. \u201cWill you go along with me, Oliver?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice. Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had got behind the beadle\u2019s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection. \u201cWill she go with me?\u201d inquired poor Oliver. \u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cBut she\u2019ll come and see you sometimes.\u201d This was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away. It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes. Hunger and recent ill usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, lest he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years. And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child\u2019s heart for the first time. Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were \u201cnearly there.\u201d To these interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin and water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle. Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith. Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At the top of the table, seated in an arm chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face. \u201cBow to the board,\u201d said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair. Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry. These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool. Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease. \u201cBoy,\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair, \u201clisten to me. You know you\u2019re an orphan, I suppose?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir?\u201d inquired poor Oliver. \u201cThe boy _is_ a fool\u2014I thought he was,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cHush!\u201d said the gentleman who had spoken first. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, weeping bitterly. \u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What _could_ the boy be crying for? \u201cI hope you say your prayers every night,\u201d said another gentleman in a gruff voice; \u201cand pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you\u2014like a Christian.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn\u2019t, because nobody had taught him. \u201cWell! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,\u201d said the red faced gentleman in the high chair. \u201cSo you\u2019ll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six o\u2019clock,\u201d added the surly one in the white waistcoat. For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England! They let the paupers go to sleep! Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it: The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered\u2014the poor people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work. \u201cOho!\u201d said the board, looking very knowing; \u201cwe are the fellows to set this to rights; we\u2019ll stop it all, in no time.\u201d So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it. With this view, they contracted with the water works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn factory to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays. They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors\u2019 Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long headed men, and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people. For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker\u2019s bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two\u2019s gruel. But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies. The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes. Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more\u2014except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides. The bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon. Boys have generally excellent appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn\u2019t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist. The evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his cook\u2019s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity: \u201cPlease, sir, I want some more.\u201d The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear. \u201cWhat!\u201d said the master at length, in a faint voice. \u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cI want some more.\u201d The master aimed a blow at Oliver\u2019s head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle. The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said, \u201cMr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for more!\u201d There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance. \u201cFor _more_!\u201d said Mr. Limbkins. \u201cCompose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\u201d \u201cHe did, sir,\u201d replied Bumble. \u201cThat boy will be hung,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cI know that boy will be hung.\u201d Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman\u2019s opinion. An animated discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling. \u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: \u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.\u201d As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no. CHAPTER III. RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual\u2019s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver\u2019s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him. Let it not be supposed by the enemies of \u201cthe system,\u201d that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example. And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself. It chanced one morning, while Oliver\u2019s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing. Mr. Gamfield\u2019s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate. \u201cWo\u2014o!\u201d said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey. The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward. Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey\u2019s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill. The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room. Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cThis here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \u2019prentis,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield. \u201cAy, my man,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile. \u201cWhat of him?\u201d \u201cIf the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good \u2019spectable chimbley sweepin\u2019 bisness,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, \u201cI wants a \u2019prentis, and I am ready to take him.\u201d \u201cWalk in,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him. \u201cIt\u2019s a nasty trade,\u201d said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish. \u201cYoung boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\u201d said another gentleman. \u201cThat\u2019s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make \u2019em come down again,\u201d said Gamfield; \u201cthat\u2019s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain\u2019t o\u2019 no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that\u2019s wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\u2019l\u2019men, and there\u2019s nothink like a good hot blaze to make \u2019em come down vith a run. It\u2019s humane too, gen\u2019l\u2019men, acause, even if they\u2019ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes \u2019em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\u201d The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \u201csaving of expenditure,\u201d \u201clooked well in the accounts,\u201d \u201chave a printed report published,\u201d were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed, on account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis. At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said: \u201cWe have considered your proposition, and we don\u2019t approve of it.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cDecidedly not,\u201d added the other members. As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table. \u201cSo you won\u2019t let me have him, gen\u2019l\u2019men?\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr. Limbkins; \u201cat least, as it\u2019s a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\u201d Mr. Gamfield\u2019s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019ll you give, gen\u2019l\u2019men? Come! Don\u2019t be too hard on a poor man. What\u2019ll you give?\u201d \u201cI should say, three pound ten was plenty,\u201d said Mr. Limbkins. \u201cTen shillings too much,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cCome!\u201d said Gamfield; \u201csay four pound, gen\u2019l\u2019men. Say four pound, and you\u2019ve got rid of him for good and all. There!\u201d \u201cThree pound ten,\u201d repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly. \u201cCome! I\u2019ll split the diff\u2019erence, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d urged Gamfield. \u201cThree pound fifteen.\u201d \u201cNot a farthing more,\u201d was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins. \u201cYou\u2019re desperate hard upon me, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d said Gamfield, wavering. \u201cPooh! pooh! nonsense!\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cHe\u2019d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly fellow! He\u2019s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then: it\u2019ll do him good; and his board needn\u2019t come very expensive, for he hasn\u2019t been overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself. The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon. In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way. \u201cDon\u2019t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. \u201cYou\u2019re a going to be made a \u2019prentice of, Oliver.\u201d \u201cA prentice, sir!\u201d said the child, trembling. \u201cYes, Oliver,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to \u201cprentice\u201d you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!\u2014three pound ten, Oliver!\u2014seventy shillins\u2014one hundred and forty sixpences!\u2014and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can\u2019t love.\u201d As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child\u2019s face, and he sobbed bitterly. \u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; \u201cCome, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don\u2019t cry into your gruel; that\u2019s a very foolish action, Oliver.\u201d It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already. On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him. There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud: \u201cNow, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.\u201d As Mr. Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, \u201cMind what I told you, you young rascal!\u201d Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble\u2019s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great window. Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff looking men, in top boots, were lounging about. The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk. \u201cThis is the boy, your worship,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last mentioned old gentleman woke up. \u201cOh, is this the boy?\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is him, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cBow to the magistrate, my dear.\u201d Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates\u2019 powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account. \u201cWell,\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cI suppose he\u2019s fond of chimney sweeping?\u201d \u201cHe doats on it, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd he _will_ be a sweep, will he?\u201d inquired the old gentleman. \u201cIf we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow, he\u2019d run away simultaneous, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble. \u201cAnd this man that\u2019s to be his master\u2014you, sir\u2014you\u2019ll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cWhen I says I will, I means I will,\u201d replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly. \u201cYou\u2019re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open hearted man,\u201d said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver\u2019s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn\u2019t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did. \u201cI hope I am, sir,\u201d said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer. \u201cI have no doubt you are, my friend,\u201d replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand. It was the critical moment of Oliver\u2019s fate. If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half blind magistrate. The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect. \u201cMy boy!\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cyou look pale and alarmed. What is the matter?\u201d \u201cStand a little away from him, Beadle,\u201d said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. \u201cNow, boy, tell us what\u2019s the matter: don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room\u2014that they would starve him\u2014beat him\u2014kill him if they pleased\u2014rather than send him away with that dreadful man. \u201cWell!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity. \u201cWell! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare facedest.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Beadle,\u201d said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective. \u201cI beg your worship\u2019s pardon,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright. \u201cDid your worship speak to me?\u201d \u201cYes. Hold your tongue.\u201d Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold his tongue! A moral revolution! The old gentleman in the tortoise shell spectacles looked at his companion, he nodded significantly. \u201cWe refuse to sanction these indentures,\u201d said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke. \u201cI hope,\u201d stammered Mr. Limbkins: \u201cI hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.\u201d \u201cThe magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,\u201d said the second old gentleman sharply. \u201cTake the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.\u201d That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description. The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again to let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him. CHAPTER IV. OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea. The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port. This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class. The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay. Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker. Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand. \u201cI have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the undertaker. \u201cYou\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d said the beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. \u201cI say you\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane. \u201cThink so?\u201d said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event. \u201cThe prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr. Bumble.\u201d \u201cSo are the coffins,\u201d replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in. Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation. \u201cWell, well, Mr. Bumble,\u201d he said at length, \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. Well seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cevery trade has its drawbacks. A fair profit is, of course, allowable.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cand if I don\u2019t get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long run, you see\u2014he! he! he!\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThough I must say,\u201d continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: \u201cthough I must say, Mr. Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three or four inches over one\u2019s calculation makes a great hole in one\u2019s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.\u201d As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme. \u201cBy the bye,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anybody who wants a boy, do you? A porochial \u2019prentis, who is at present a dead weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?\u201d As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words \u201cfive pounds\u201d: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size. \u201cGadso!\u201d said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt edged lappel of his official coat; \u201cthat\u2019s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about. You know\u2014dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr. Bumble! I never noticed it before.\u201d \u201cYes, I think it rather pretty,\u201d said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. \u201cThe die is the same as the porochial seal\u2014the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear\u2019s morning, Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.\u201d \u201cI recollect,\u201d said the undertaker. \u201cThe jury brought it in, \u2018Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\u2019 didn\u2019t they?\u201d Mr. Bumble nodded. \u201cAnd they made it a special verdict, I think,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cby adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had\u2014\u201d \u201cTush! Foolery!\u201d interposed the beadle. \u201cIf the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they\u2019d have enough to do.\u201d \u201cVery true,\u201d said the undertaker; \u201cthey would indeed.\u201d \u201cJuries,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: \u201cjuries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.\u201d \u201cSo they are,\u201d said the undertaker. \u201cThey haven\u2019t no more philosophy nor political economy about \u2019em than that,\u201d said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously. \u201cNo more they have,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker. \u201cI despise \u2019em,\u201d said the beadle, growing very red in the face. \u201cSo do I,\u201d rejoined the undertaker. \u201cAnd I only wish we\u2019d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cthe rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for \u2019em.\u201d \u201cLet \u2019em alone for that,\u201d replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer. Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice: \u201cWell; what about the boy?\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cwhy, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor\u2019s rates.\u201d \u201cHem!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d replied the undertaker, \u201cI was thinking that if I pay so much towards \u2019em, I\u2019ve a right to get as much out of \u2019em as I can, Mr. Bumble; and so\u2014I think I\u2019ll take the boy myself.\u201d Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening \u201cupon liking\u201d\u2014a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with. When little Oliver was taken before \u201cthe gentlemen\u201d that evening; and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house lad to a coffin maker\u2019s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith. Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand\u2014which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep\u2014he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble\u2019s coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering. For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr. Bumble\u2019s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee breeches. As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage. \u201cOliver!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice. \u201cPull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.\u201d Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another. The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one. Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble\u2019s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers. \u201cWell!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity. \u201cWell! Of _all_ the ungratefullest, and worst disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, sir,\u201d sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well known cane; \u201cno, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so\u2014so\u2014\u201d \u201cSo what?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement. \u201cSo lonely, sir! So very lonely!\u201d cried the child. \u201cEverybody hates me. Oh! sir, don\u2019t, don\u2019t pray be cross to me!\u201d The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion\u2019s face, with tears of real agony. Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver\u2019s piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about \u201cthat troublesome cough,\u201d bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence. The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some entries in his day book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered. \u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; \u201cis that you, Bumble?\u201d \u201cNo one else, Mr. Sowerberry,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cHere! I\u2019ve brought the boy.\u201d Oliver made a bow. \u201cOh! that\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said the undertaker: raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. \u201cMrs. Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?\u201d Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, thin, squeezed up woman, with a vixenish countenance. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, \u201cthis is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.\u201d Oliver bowed again. \u201cDear me!\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, \u201che\u2019s very small.\u201d \u201cWhy, he _is_ rather small,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; \u201che is small. There\u2019s no denying it. But he\u2019ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry\u2014he\u2019ll grow.\u201d \u201cAh! I dare say he will,\u201d replied the lady pettishly, \u201con our victuals and our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they\u2019re worth. However, men always think they know best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o\u2019 bones.\u201d With this, the undertaker\u2019s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante room to the coal cellar, and denominated \u201ckitchen\u201d; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair. \u201cHere, Charlotte,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, \u201cgive this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He hasn\u2019t come home since the morning, so he may go without \u2019em. I dare say the boy isn\u2019t too dainty to eat \u2019em\u2014are you, boy?\u201d Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him. I wish some well fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected. I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish. \u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, when Oliver had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his future appetite: \u201chave you done?\u201d There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative. \u201cThen come with me,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; \u201cyour bed\u2019s under the counter. You don\u2019t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn\u2019t much matter whether you do or don\u2019t, for you can\u2019t sleep anywhere else. Come; don\u2019t keep me here all night!\u201d Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress. CHAPTER V. OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER\u2019S BUSINESS Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker\u2019s shop, set the lamp down on a workman\u2019s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror. Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets. Coffin plates, elm chips, bright headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave. Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well remembered face sank heavily into his heart. But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep. Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty five times. When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began. \u201cOpen the door, will yer?\u201d cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door. \u201cI will, directly, sir,\u201d replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key. \u201cI suppose yer the new boy, ain\u2019t yer?\u201d said the voice through the key hole. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cHow old are yer?\u201d inquired the voice. \u201cTen, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cThen I\u2019ll whop yer when I get in,\u201d said the voice; \u201cyou just see if I don\u2019t, that\u2019s all, my work\u2019us brat!\u201d and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle. Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door. For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp knife, and then consumed with great dexterity. \u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; \u201cdid you knock?\u201d \u201cI kicked,\u201d replied the charity boy. \u201cDid you want a coffin, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver, innocently. At this, the charity boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way. \u201cYer don\u2019t know who I am, I suppose, Work\u2019us?\u201d said the charity boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver. \u201cI\u2019m Mister Noah Claypole,\u201d said the charity boy, \u201cand you\u2019re under me. Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!\u201d With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit. It is difficult for a large headed, small eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls. Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that \u201che\u2019d catch it,\u201d condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver having \u201ccaught it,\u201d in fulfilment of Noah\u2019s prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast. \u201cCome near the fire, Noah,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cI saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master\u2019s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah\u2019s back, and take them bits that I\u2019ve put out on the cover of the bread pan. There\u2019s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they\u2019ll want you to mind the shop. D\u2019ye hear?\u201d \u201cD\u2019ye hear, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah Claypole. \u201cLor, Noah!\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cwhat a rum creature you are! Why don\u2019t you let the boy alone?\u201d \u201cLet him alone!\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhy everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!\u201d \u201cOh, you queer soul!\u201d said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him. Noah was a charity boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of \u201cleathers,\u201d \u201ccharity,\u201d and the like; and Noah had borne them without reply. But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity boy. Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker\u2019s some three weeks or a month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry\u2014the shop being shut up\u2014were taking their supper in the little back parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said, \u201cMy dear\u2014\u201d He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short. \u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply. \u201cNothing, my dear, nothing,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry. \u201cUgh, you brute!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cNot at all, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me what you were going to say,\u201d interposed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cI am nobody; don\u2019t consult me, pray. _I_ don\u2019t want to intrude upon your secrets.\u201d As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences. \u201cBut, my dear,\u201d said Sowerberry, \u201cI want to ask your advice.\u201d \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t ask mine,\u201d replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: \u201cask somebody else\u2019s.\u201d Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common and much approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to hear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded. \u201cIt\u2019s only about young Twist, my dear,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry. \u201cA very good looking boy, that, my dear.\u201d \u201cHe need be, for he eats enough,\u201d observed the lady. \u201cThere\u2019s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,\u201d resumed Mr. Sowerberry, \u201cwhich is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.\u201d Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment. Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady\u2019s part, proceeded. \u201cI don\u2019t mean a regular mute to attend grown up people, my dear, but only for children\u2019s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.\u201d Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband\u2019s mind before? Mr. Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required. The occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket book: from which he selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry. \u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; \u201can order for a coffin, eh?\u201d \u201cFor a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket book: which, like himself, was very corpulent. \u201cBayton,\u201d said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr. Bumble. \u201cI never heard the name before.\u201d Bumble shook his head, as he replied, \u201cObstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry; very obstinate. Proud, too, I\u2019m afraid, sir.\u201d \u201cProud, eh?\u201d exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. \u201cCome, that\u2019s too much.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s sickening,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cAntimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker. \u201cWe only heard of the family the night before last,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cand we shouldn\u2019t have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad. He had gone out to dinner; but his \u2019prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent \u2019em some medicine in a blacking bottle, offhand.\u201d \u201cAh, there\u2019s promptness,\u201d said the undertaker. \u201cPromptness, indeed!\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cBut what\u2019s the consequence; what\u2019s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won\u2019t suit his wife\u2019s complaint, and so she shan\u2019t take it\u2014says she shan\u2019t take it, sir! Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal heaver, only a week before\u2014sent \u2019em for nothing, with a blackin\u2019 bottle in,\u2014and he sends back word that she shan\u2019t take it, sir!\u201d As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble\u2019s mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation. \u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cI ne\u2014ver\u2014did\u2014\u201d \u201cNever did, sir!\u201d ejaculated the beadle. \u201cNo, nor nobody never did; but now she\u2019s dead, we\u2019ve got to bury her; and that\u2019s the direction; and the sooner it\u2019s done, the better.\u201d Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop. \u201cWhy, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble\u2019s voice. He needn\u2019t have taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble\u2019s glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome. \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, \u201cthe sooner this job is done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.\u201d Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission. They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search. The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements had shop fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body. The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine. There was neither knocker nor bell handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid, the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles. It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed him. There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket. Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse. The man\u2019s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot. The old woman\u2019s face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside. \u201cNobody shall go near her,\u201d said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess. \u201cKeep back! Damn you, keep back, if you\u2019ve a life to lose!\u201d \u201cNonsense, my good man,\u201d said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes. \u201cNonsense!\u201d \u201cI tell you,\u201d said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,\u2014\u201cI tell you I won\u2019t have her put into the ground. She couldn\u2019t rest there. The worms would worry her\u2014not eat her\u2014she is so worn away.\u201d The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body. \u201cAh!\u201d said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; \u201ckneel down, kneel down\u2014kneel round her, every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark\u2014in the dark! She couldn\u2019t even see her children\u2019s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They starved her!\u201d He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips. The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker. \u201cShe was my daughter,\u201d said the old woman, nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. \u201cLord, Lord! Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! Lord, Lord!\u2014to think of it; it\u2019s as good as a play\u2014as good as a play!\u201d As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away. \u201cStop, stop!\u201d said the old woman in a loud whisper. \u201cWill she be buried tomorrow, or next day, or tonight? I laid her out; and I must walk, you know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold. We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some bread\u2014only a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some bread, dear?\u201d she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker\u2019s coat, as he once more moved towards the door. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cof course. Anything you like!\u201d He disengaged himself from the old woman\u2019s grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away. The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street. \u201cNow, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!\u201d whispered Sowerberry in the old woman\u2019s ear; \u201cwe are rather late; and it won\u2019t do, to keep the clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,\u2014as quick as you like!\u201d Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his master\u2019s, ran by the side. There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide and seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper. At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave. Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again. \u201cNow, Bill!\u201d said Sowerberry to the grave digger. \u201cFill up!\u201d It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon. \u201cCome, my good fellow!\u201d said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. \u201cThey want to shut up the yard.\u201d The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon. The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways. \u201cWell, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry, as they walked home, \u201chow do you like it?\u201d \u201cPretty well, thank you, sir\u201d replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation. \u201cNot very much, sir.\u201d \u201cAh, you\u2019ll get used to it in time, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry. \u201cNothing when you _are_ used to it, my boy.\u201d Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard. CHAPTER VI. OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM The month\u2019s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry\u2019s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town. As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong minded people bear their trials and losses. For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be\u2014quite cheerful and contented\u2014conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea drinking was over. All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration. That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hat band, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin cap and leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery. And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver\u2019s history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings. One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton\u2014a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck; when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist. Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table cloth; and pulled Oliver\u2019s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a \u201csneak\u201d; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill conditioned charity boy as he was. But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny. He got rather personal. \u201cWork\u2019us,\u201d said Noah, \u201chow\u2019s your mother?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d replied Oliver; \u201cdon\u2019t you say anything about her to me!\u201d Oliver\u2019s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying. Under this impression he returned to the charge. \u201cWhat did she die of, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah. \u201cOf a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,\u201d replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. \u201cI think I know what it must be to die of that!\u201d \u201cTol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work\u2019us,\u201d said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver\u2019s cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s set you a snivelling now?\u201d \u201cNot _you_,\u201d replied Oliver, sharply. \u201cThere; that\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t say anything more to me about her; you\u2019d better not!\u201d \u201cBetter not!\u201d exclaimed Noah. \u201cWell! Better not! Work\u2019us, don\u2019t be impudent. _Your_ mother, too! She was a nice \u2019un, she was. Oh, Lor!\u201d And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion. \u201cYer know, Work\u2019us,\u201d continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver\u2019s silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: \u201cYer know, Work\u2019us, it can\u2019t be helped now; and of course yer couldn\u2019t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I\u2019m sure we all are, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work\u2019us, yer mother was a regular right down bad \u2019un.\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly. \u201cA regular right down bad \u2019un, Work\u2019us,\u201d replied Noah, coolly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a great deal better, Work\u2019us, that she died when she did, or else she\u2019d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more likely than either, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table; seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the ground. A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known before. \u201cHe\u2019ll murder me!\u201d blubbered Noah. \u201cCharlotte! missis! Here\u2019s the new boy a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver\u2019s gone mad! Char\u2014lotte!\u201d Noah\u2019s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down. \u201cOh, you little wretch!\u201d screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training. \u201cOh, you little un grate ful, mur de rous, hor rid villain!\u201d And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society. Charlotte\u2019s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be effectual in calming Oliver\u2019s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind. This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust cellar, and there locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair, and burst into tears. \u201cBless her, she\u2019s going off!\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cA glass of water, Noah, dear. Make haste!\u201d \u201cOh! Charlotte,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could, through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. \u201cOh! Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!\u201d \u201cAh! mercy indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d was the reply. \u201cI only hope this\u2019ll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was all but killed, ma\u2019am, when I came in.\u201d \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry, looking piteously on the charity boy. Noah, whose top waistcoat button might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of Oliver\u2019s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some affecting tears and sniffs. \u201cWhat\u2019s to be done!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cYour master\u2019s not at home; there\u2019s not a man in the house, and he\u2019ll kick that door down in ten minutes.\u201d Oliver\u2019s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question, rendered this occurance highly probable. \u201cDear, dear! I don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cunless we send for the police officers.\u201d \u201cOr the millingtary,\u201d suggested Mr. Claypole. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver\u2019s old friend. \u201cRun to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It\u2019ll keep the swelling down.\u201d Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity boy tearing through the streets pell mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp knife at his eye. CHAPTER VII. OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse gate. Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with the boy!\u201d said the old pauper. \u201cMr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried Noah, with well affected dismay, and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr. Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,\u2014which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance, as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity. \u201cOh, Mr. Bumble, sir!\u201d said Noah: \u201cOliver, sir,\u2014Oliver has\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat? What?\u201d interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes. \u201cNot run away; he hasn\u2019t run away, has he, Noah?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he\u2019s turned wicious,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cHe tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony, please, sir!\u201d And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture. When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid. The gentleman\u2019s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process? \u201cIt\u2019s a poor boy from the free school, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, \u201cwho has been nearly murdered\u2014all but murdered, sir,\u2014by young Twist.\u201d \u201cBy Jove!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short. \u201cI knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!\u201d \u201cHe has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness. \u201cAnd his missis,\u201d interposed Mr. Claypole. \u201cAnd his master, too, I think you said, Noah?\u201d added Mr. Bumble. \u201cNo! he\u2019s out, or he would have murdered him,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cHe said he wanted to.\u201d \u201cAh! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cAnd please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him\u2014\u2019cause master\u2019s out.\u201d \u201cCertainly, my boy; certainly,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah\u2019s head, which was about three inches higher than his own. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy\u2014a very good boy. Here\u2019s a penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry\u2019s with your cane, and see what\u2019s best to be done. Don\u2019t spare him, Bumble.\u201d \u201cNo, I will not, sir,\u201d replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner\u2019s satisfaction, Mr. Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker\u2019s shop. Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone: \u201cOliver!\u201d \u201cCome; you let me out!\u201d replied Oliver, from the inside. \u201cDo you know this here voice, Oliver?\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cAin\u2019t you afraid of it, sir? Ain\u2019t you a trembling while I speak, sir?\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cNo!\u201d replied Oliver, boldly. An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three by standers, in mute astonishment. \u201cOh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cNo boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not madness, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation. \u201cIt\u2019s meat.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cMeat, ma\u2019am, meat,\u201d replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. \u201cYou\u2019ve overfed him, ma\u2019am. You\u2019ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma\u2019am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It\u2019s quite enough that we let \u2019em have live bodies. If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma\u2019am, this would never have happened.\u201d \u201cDear, dear!\u201d ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: \u201cthis comes of being liberal!\u201d The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble\u2019s heavy accusation, of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed. \u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; \u201cthe only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he\u2019s a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well disposed woman, weeks before.\u201d At this point of Mr. Bumble\u2019s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at this juncture. Oliver\u2019s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar. Oliver\u2019s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed. \u201cNow, you are a nice young fellow, ain\u2019t you?\u201d said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear. \u201cHe called my mother names,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWell, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cShe deserved what he said, and worse.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cShe did,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerberry. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d said Oliver. Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears. This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went\u2014it was not very extensive\u2014kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble\u2019s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed. It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day\u2019s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him! For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad. It was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy\u2019s eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the door. Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning. With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around\u2014one moment\u2019s pause of hesitation\u2014he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street. He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly. He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields, which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on. Along this same footpath, Oliver well remembered he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on. He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time. \u201cHush, Dick!\u201d said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him. \u201cIs any one up?\u201d \u201cNobody but me,\u201d replied the child. \u201cYou musn\u2019t say you saw me, Dick,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI am running away. They beat and ill use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off. I don\u2019t know where. How pale you are!\u201d \u201cI heard the doctor tell them I was dying,\u201d replied the child with a faint smile. \u201cI am very glad to see you, dear; but don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I will, to say good b\u2019ye to you,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI shall see you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d replied the child. \u201cAfter I am dead, but not before. I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss me,\u201d said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver\u2019s neck. \u201cGood b\u2019ye, dear! God bless you!\u201d The blessing was from a young child\u2019s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it. CHAPTER VIII. OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN Oliver reached the stile at which the by path terminated; and once more gained the high road. It was eight o\u2019clock now. Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon, fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live. The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy\u2019s mind. London!\u2014that great place!\u2014nobody\u2014not even Mr. Bumble\u2014could ever find him there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward. He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too\u2014a gift of Sowerberry\u2019s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well\u2014in his pocket. \u201cA clean shirt,\u201d thought Oliver, \u201cis a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty five miles\u2019 walk in winter time.\u201d But Oliver\u2019s thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on. Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage doors by the road side. When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay rick, determined to lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields, and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before. Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles. He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed. He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along. He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn\u2019t deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind. In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand about the inn yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady\u2019s ordering one of the post boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something. If he begged at a farmer\u2019s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle\u2014which brought Oliver\u2019s heart into his mouth,\u2014very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together. In fact, if it had not been for a good hearted turnpike man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver\u2019s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother\u2019s; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king\u2019s highway. But the turnpike man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford\u2014and more\u2014with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver\u2019s soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone. Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door step. By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat. He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way. He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said, \u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen. He was a snub nosed, flat browed, common faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather bow legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment\u2014and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again. He wore a man\u2019s coat, which reached nearly to his heels. He had turned the cuffs back, half way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them. He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers. \u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d said this strange young gentleman to Oliver. \u201cI am very hungry and tired,\u201d replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. \u201cI have walked a long way. I have been walking these seven days.\u201d \u201cWalking for sivin days!\u201d said the young gentleman. \u201cOh, I see. Beak\u2019s order, eh? But,\u201d he added, noticing Oliver\u2019s look of surprise, \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know what a beak is, my flash com pan i on.\u201d Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird\u2019s mouth described by the term in question. \u201cMy eyes, how green!\u201d exclaimed the young gentleman. \u201cWhy, a beak\u2019s a madgst\u2019rate; and when you walk by a beak\u2019s order, it\u2019s not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you never on the mill?\u201d \u201cWhat mill?\u201d inquired Oliver. \u201cWhat mill! Why, _the_ mill\u2014the mill as takes up so little room that it\u2019ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind\u2019s low with people, than when it\u2019s high; acos then they can\u2019t get workmen. But come,\u201d said the young gentleman; \u201cyou want grub, and you shall have it. I\u2019m at low water mark myself\u2014only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I\u2019ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There! Now then! Morrice!\u201d Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler\u2019s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready dressed ham and a half quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, \u201ca fourpenny bran!\u201d the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentleman turned into a small public house, and led the way to a tap room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend\u2019s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention. \u201cGoing to London?\u201d said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cGot any lodgings?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cMoney?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big coat sleeves would let them go. \u201cDo you live in London?\u201d inquired Oliver. \u201cYes. I do, when I\u2019m at home,\u201d replied the boy. \u201cI suppose you want some place to sleep in tonight, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI do, indeed,\u201d answered Oliver. \u201cI have not slept under a roof since I left the country.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fret your eyelids on that score,\u201d said the young gentleman. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be in London tonight; and I know a \u2019spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot\u2019ll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change\u2014that is, if any gentleman he knows interduces you. And don\u2019t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means. Certainly not!\u201d The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so. This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend\u2019s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and _prot\u00e9g\u00e9_ of the elderly gentleman before mentioned. Mr. Dawkins\u2019s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron\u2019s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the _sobriquet_ of \u201cThe Artful Dodger,\u201d Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him. Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance. As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington. They crossed from the Angel into St. John\u2019s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley in the Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels. Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours. There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door ways, great ill looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well disposed or harmless errands. Oliver was just considering whether he hadn\u2019t better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them. \u201cNow, then!\u201d cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger. \u201cPlummy and slam!\u201d was the reply. This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man\u2019s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away. \u201cThere\u2019s two on you,\u201d said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand. \u201cWho\u2019s the t\u2019other one?\u201d \u201cA new pal,\u201d replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward. \u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d \u201cGreenland. Is Fagin upstairs?\u201d \u201cYes, he\u2019s a sortin\u2019 the wipes. Up with you!\u201d The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared. Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them. He threw open the door of a back room, and drew Oliver in after him. The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt. There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate. In a frying pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying pan and the clothes horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging. Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle aged men. These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew himself, toasting fork in hand. \u201cThis is him, Fagin,\u201d said Jack Dawkins; \u201cmy friend Oliver Twist.\u201d The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance. Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard\u2014especially the one in which he held his little bundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew\u2019s toasting fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them. \u201cWe are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cDodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah, you\u2019re a staring at the pocket handkerchiefs! eh, my dear? There are a good many of \u2019em, ain\u2019t there? We\u2019ve just looked \u2019em out, ready for the wash; that\u2019s all, Oliver; that\u2019s all. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of which they went to supper. Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and water, telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired. Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep. CHAPTER IX. CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before. Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate. Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his half closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan\u2019s sides: and yet the self same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known. When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep. After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels. \u201cAha!\u201d said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin. \u201cClever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn\u2019t have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!\u201d With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names. Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered: \u201cWhat a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it\u2019s a fine thing for the trade! Five of \u2019em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white livered!\u201d As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver\u2019s face; the boy\u2019s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant\u2014for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived\u2014it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed. He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said the Jew. \u201cWhat do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick\u2014quick! for your life.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to sleep any longer, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, meekly. \u201cI am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.\u201d \u201cYou were not awake an hour ago?\u201d said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy. \u201cNo! No, indeed!\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude. \u201cUpon my word I was not, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, earnestly. \u201cI was not, indeed, sir.\u201d \u201cTush, tush, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. \u201cOf course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You\u2019re a brave boy. Ha! ha! you\u2019re a brave boy, Oliver.\u201d The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding. \u201cDid you see any of these pretty things, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning rather pale. \u201cThey\u2014they\u2019re mine, Oliver; my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that\u2019s all.\u201d Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up. \u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cStay. There\u2019s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I\u2019ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.\u201d Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone. He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew\u2019s directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat. \u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been at work this morning, my dears?\u201d \u201cHard,\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cAs nails,\u201d added Charley Bates. \u201cGood boys, good boys!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cWhat have you got, Dodger?\u201d \u201cA couple of pocket books,\u201d replied that young gentleman. \u201cLined?\u201d inquired the Jew, with eagerness. \u201cPretty well,\u201d replied the Dodger, producing two pocket books; one green, and the other red. \u201cNot so heavy as they might be,\u201d said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; \u201cbut very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman, ain\u2019t he, Oliver?\u201d \u201cVery indeed, sir,\u201d said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed. \u201cAnd what have you got, my dear?\u201d said Fagin to Charley Bates. \u201cWipes,\u201d replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket handkerchiefs. \u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, inspecting them closely; \u201cthey\u2019re very good ones, very. You haven\u2019t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we\u2019ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d \u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cYou\u2019d like to be able to make pocket handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the Jew. \u201cVery much, indeed, if you\u2019ll teach me, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation. \u201cHe is so jolly green!\u201d said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour. The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver\u2019s hair over his eyes, and said he\u2019d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver\u2019s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious. When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentleman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff box in one pocket of his trousers, a note case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the fire place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop windows. At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn\u2019t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff box, note case, watch guard, chain, shirt pin, pocket handkerchief, even the spectacle case. If the old gentleman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again. When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed, as there is no doubt they were. The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend. \u201cThere, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cThat\u2019s a pleasant life, isn\u2019t it? They have gone out for the day.\u201d \u201cHave they done work, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthat is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won\u2019t neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it. Make \u2019em your models, my dear. Make \u2019em your models,\u201d tapping the fire shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; \u201cdo everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters\u2014especially the Dodger\u2019s, my dear. He\u2019ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.\u2014Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, stopping short. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cSee if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.\u201d Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other. \u201cIs it gone?\u201d cried the Jew. \u201cHere it is, sir,\u201d said Oliver, showing it in his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a clever boy, my dear,\u201d said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. \u201cI never saw a sharper lad. Here\u2019s a shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you\u2019ll be the greatest man of the time. And now come here, and I\u2019ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.\u201d Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman\u2019s pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study. CHAPTER X. OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew\u2019s room, picking the marks out of the pocket handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions. Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman\u2019s character. Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent. At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman\u2019s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger. The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first. The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction. These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger. They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, \u201cThe Green\u201d: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d demanded Oliver. \u201cHush!\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cDo you see that old cove at the book stall?\u201d \u201cThe old gentleman over the way?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cYes, I see him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said the Dodger. \u201cA prime plant,\u201d observed Master Charley Bates. Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement. The old gentleman was a very respectable looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness. What was Oliver\u2019s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman\u2019s pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed! In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy\u2019s mind. He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground. This was all done in a minute\u2019s space. In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d with all his might, made off after him, book in hand. But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue and cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens. Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him. \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand boy his parcels; the school boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore. Away they run, pell mell, helter skelter, slap dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re echo with the sound. \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a passion _for hunting something_ deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy. \u201cStop thief!\u201d Ay, stop him for God\u2019s sake, were it only in mercy! Stopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse. \u201cStand aside!\u201d \u201cGive him a little air!\u201d \u201cNonsense! he don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the gentleman?\u201d \u201cHere he is, coming down the street.\u201d \u201cMake room there for the gentleman!\u201d \u201cIs this the boy, sir!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers. \u201cYes,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI am afraid it is the boy.\u201d \u201cAfraid!\u201d murmured the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che has hurt himself.\u201d \u201c_I_ did that, sir,\u201d said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; \u201cand preciously I cut my knuckle agin\u2019 his mouth. _I_ stopped him, sir.\u201d The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar. \u201cCome, get up,\u201d said the man, roughly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,\u201d said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. \u201cThey are here somewhere.\u201d \u201cOh no, they ain\u2019t,\u201d said the officer. He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to. \u201cCome, get up!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d said the old gentleman, compassionately. \u201cOh no, I won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d replied the officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof. \u201cCome, I know you; it won\u2019t do. Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?\u201d Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket collar, at a rapid pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer\u2019s side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went. CHAPTER XI. TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office. The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d said the man carelessly. \u201cA young fogle hunter,\u201d replied the man who had Oliver in charge. \u201cAre you the party that\u2019s been robbed, sir?\u201d inquired the man with the keys. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the old gentleman; \u201cbut I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief. I\u2014I would rather not press the case.\u201d \u201cMust go before the magistrate now, sir,\u201d replied the man. \u201cHis worship will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!\u201d This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up. This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our station houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges\u2014the word is worth noting\u2014in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who doubts this, compare the two. The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance. \u201cThere is something in that boy\u2019s face,\u201d said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; \u201csomething that touches and interests me. _Can_ he be innocent? He looked like\u2014 Bye the bye,\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, \u201cBless my soul!\u2014where have I seen something like that look before?\u201d After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind\u2019s eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years. \u201cNo,\u201d said the old gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cit must be imagination.\u201d He wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven. But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver\u2019s features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book. He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang. The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side of the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene. Mr. Fang was a lean, long backed, stiff necked, middle sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages. The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate\u2019s desk, said, suiting the action to the word, \u201cThat is my name and address, sir.\u201d He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned. Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl. \u201cWho are you?\u201d said Mr. Fang. The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card. \u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper. \u201cWho is this fellow?\u201d \u201cMy name, sir,\u201d said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman, \u201cmy name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.\u201d Saying this, Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information. \u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, \u201cwhat\u2019s this fellow charged with?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not charged at all, your worship,\u201d replied the officer. \u201cHe appears against this boy, your worship.\u201d His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one. \u201cAppears against the boy, does he?\u201d said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot. \u201cSwear him!\u201d \u201cBefore I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cand that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed\u2014\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, sir!\u201d said Mr. Fang, peremptorily. \u201cI will not, sir!\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cHold your tongue this instant, or I\u2019ll have you turned out of the office!\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cYou\u2019re an insolent impertinent fellow. How dare you bully a magistrate!\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening. \u201cSwear this person!\u201d said Fang to the clerk. \u201cI\u2019ll not hear another word. Swear him.\u201d Mr. Brownlow\u2019s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once. \u201cNow,\u201d said Fang, \u201cwhat\u2019s the charge against this boy? What have you got to say, sir?\u201d \u201cI was standing at a bookstall\u2014\u201d Mr. Brownlow began. \u201cHold your tongue, sir,\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cPoliceman! Where\u2019s the policeman? Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?\u201d The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it. \u201cAre there any witnesses?\u201d inquired Mr. Fang. \u201cNone, your worship,\u201d replied the policeman. Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion. \u201cDo you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I\u2019ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by\u2014\u201d By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard\u2014accidently, of course. With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had seen him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow. \u201cHe has been hurt already,\u201d said the old gentleman in conclusion. \u201cAnd I fear,\u201d he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, \u201cI really fear that he is ill.\u201d \u201cOh! yes, I dare say!\u201d said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. \u201cCome, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won\u2019t do. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, you hardened scoundrel?\u201d demanded Mr. Fang. \u201cOfficer, what\u2019s his name?\u201d This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess. \u201cHe says his name\u2019s Tom White, your worship,\u201d said the kind hearted thief taker. \u201cOh, he won\u2019t speak out, won\u2019t he?\u201d said Fang. \u201cVery well, very well. Where does he live?\u201d \u201cWhere he can, your worship,\u201d replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver\u2019s answer. \u201cHas he any parents?\u201d inquired Mr. Fang. \u201cHe says they died in his infancy, your worship,\u201d replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply. At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water. \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Mr. Fang: \u201cdon\u2019t try to make a fool of me.\u201d \u201cI think he really is ill, your worship,\u201d remonstrated the officer. \u201cI know better,\u201d said Mr. Fang. \u201cTake care of him, officer,\u201d said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; \u201che\u2019ll fall down.\u201d \u201cStand away, officer,\u201d cried Fang; \u201clet him, if he likes.\u201d Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir. \u201cI knew he was shamming,\u201d said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact. \u201cLet him lie there; he\u2019ll soon be tired of that.\u201d \u201cHow do you propose to deal with the case, sir?\u201d inquired the clerk in a low voice. \u201cSummarily,\u201d replied Mr. Fang. \u201cHe stands committed for three months\u2014hard labour of course. Clear the office.\u201d The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench. \u201cStop, stop! don\u2019t take him away! For Heaven\u2019s sake stop a moment!\u201d cried the new comer, breathless with haste. Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, especially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press. Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder. \u201cWhat is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!\u201d cried Mr. Fang. \u201cI _will_ speak,\u201d cried the man; \u201cI will not be turned out. I saw it all. I keep the book stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put down. Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.\u201d The man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up. \u201cSwear the man,\u201d growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. \u201cNow, man, what have you got to say?\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d said the man: \u201cI saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.\u201d Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come here before?\u201d said Fang, after a pause. \u201cI hadn\u2019t a soul to mind the shop,\u201d replied the man. \u201cEverybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I\u2019ve run here all the way.\u201d \u201cThe prosecutor was reading, was he?\u201d inquired Fang, after another pause. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the man. \u201cThe very book he has in his hand.\u201d \u201cOh, that book, eh?\u201d said Fang. \u201cIs it paid for?\u201d \u201cNo, it is not,\u201d replied the man, with a smile. \u201cDear me, I forgot all about it!\u201d exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently. \u201cA nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!\u201d said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane. \u201cI consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is discharged. Clear the office!\u201d \u201cD\u2014n me!\u201d cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, \u201cd\u2014n me! I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \u201cClear the office!\u201d said the magistrate. \u201cOfficers, do you hear? Clear the office!\u201d The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame. \u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. \u201cCall a coach, somebody, pray. Directly!\u201d A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other. \u201cMay I accompany you?\u201d said the book stall keeper, looking in. \u201cBless me, yes, my dear sir,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow quickly. \u201cI forgot you. Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow! There\u2019s no time to lose.\u201d The book stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove. CHAPTER XII. IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS. The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds. But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame. Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around. \u201cWhat room is this? Where have I been brought to?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThis is not the place I went to sleep in.\u201d He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed\u2019s head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle work. \u201cHush, my dear,\u201d said the old lady softly. \u201cYou must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,\u2014as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there\u2019s a dear!\u201d With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver\u2019s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck. \u201cSave us!\u201d said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. \u201cWhat a grateful little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!\u201d \u201cPerhaps she does see me,\u201d whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; \u201cperhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.\u201d \u201cThat was the fever, my dear,\u201d said the old lady mildly. \u201cI suppose it was,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cbecause heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy. But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died. She can\u2019t know anything about me though,\u201d added Oliver after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cIf she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.\u201d The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again. So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better. \u201cYou _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cYes, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cYes, I know you are,\u201d said the gentleman: \u201cYou\u2019re hungry too, an\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d answered Oliver. \u201cHem!\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNo, I know you\u2019re not. He is not hungry, Mrs. Bedwin,\u201d said the gentleman: looking very wise. The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself. \u201cYou feel sleepy, don\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, rather thirsty,\u201d answered Oliver. \u201cJust as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural that he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma\u2019am, and some dry toast without any butter. Don\u2019t keep him too warm, ma\u2019am; but be careful that you don\u2019t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?\u201d The old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs. Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o\u2019clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again. And thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy\u2019s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven. Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past! It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He belonged to the world again. In three days\u2019 time he was able to sit in an easy chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper\u2019s room, which belonged to her. Having him set, here, by the fire side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently. \u201cNever mind me, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI\u2019m only having a regular good cry. There; it\u2019s all over now; and I\u2019m quite comfortable.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re very, very kind to me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cWell, never you mind that, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cthat\u2019s got nothing to do with your broth; and it\u2019s full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation. \u201cAre you fond of pictures, dear?\u201d inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the canvas; \u201cI have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful, mild face that lady\u2019s is!\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said the old lady, \u201cpainters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn\u2019t get any custom, child. The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known _that_ would never succeed; it\u2019s a deal too honest. A deal,\u201d said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness. \u201cIs\u2014is that a likeness, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cYes,\u201d said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; \u201cthat\u2019s a portrait.\u201d \u201cWhose, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver. \u201cWhy, really, my dear, I don\u2019t know,\u201d answered the old lady in a good humoured manner. \u201cIt\u2019s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.\u201d \u201cIt is so pretty,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWhy, sure you\u2019re not afraid of it?\u201d said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting. \u201cOh no, no,\u201d returned Oliver quickly; \u201cbut the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,\u201d added Oliver in a low voice, \u201cas if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cLord save us!\u201d exclaimed the old lady, starting; \u201cdon\u2019t talk in that way, child. You\u2019re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won\u2019t see it. There!\u201d said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; \u201cyou don\u2019t see it now, at all events.\u201d Oliver _did_ see it in his mind\u2019s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow. Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions. Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow\u2019s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain. \u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. \u201cI\u2019m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I\u2019m afraid I have caught cold.\u201d \u201cI hope not, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cEverything you have had, has been well aired, sir.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Bedwin. I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cI rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner time yesterday; but never mind that. How do you feel, my dear?\u201d \u201cVery happy, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cAnd very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.\u201d \u201cGood boy,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. \u201cHave you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?\u201d \u201cHe has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Bedwin, drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word, to intimate that between slops, and broth well compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever. \u201cUgh!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; \u201ca couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn\u2019t they, Tom White, eh?\u201d \u201cMy name is Oliver, sir,\u201d replied the little invalid with a look of great astonishment. \u201cOliver,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cOliver what? Oliver White, eh?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.\u201d \u201cQueer name!\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cWhat made you tell the magistrate your name was White?\u201d \u201cI never told him so, sir,\u201d returned Oliver in amazement. This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver\u2019s face. It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments. \u201cSome mistake,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze. \u201cI hope you are not angry with me, sir?\u201d said Oliver, raising his eyes beseechingly. \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the old gentleman. \u201cWhy! what\u2019s this? Bedwin, look there!\u201d As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver\u2019s head, and then to the boy\u2019s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy! Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording\u2014 That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue and cry which was raised at Oliver\u2019s heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow\u2019s personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound judging philosophers have laid down as the main springs of all Nature\u2019s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady\u2019s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex. If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut. Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves. Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case. It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d inquired the Dodger. \u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d roared Charley Bates. \u201cHold your noise,\u201d remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. \u201cDo you want to be grabbed, stupid?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Charley, \u201cI can\u2019t help it! To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again\u2019 the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him\u2014oh, my eye!\u201d The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door step, and laughed louder than before. \u201cWhat\u2019ll Fagin say?\u201d inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question. \u201cWhat?\u201d repeated Charley Bates. \u201cAh, what?\u201d said the Dodger. \u201cWhy, what should he say?\u201d inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger\u2019s manner was impressive. \u201cWhat should he say?\u201d Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, scratched his head, and nodded thrice. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Charley. \u201cToor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn\u2019t, and high cockolorum,\u201d said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance. This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so; and again said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court. Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance. The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened. \u201cWhy, how\u2019s this?\u201d muttered the Jew: changing countenance; \u201conly two of \u2019em? Where\u2019s the third? They can\u2019t have got into trouble. Hark!\u201d The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them. CHAPTER XIII. SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY \u201cWhere\u2019s Oliver?\u201d said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. \u201cWhere\u2019s the boy?\u201d The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply. \u201cWhat\u2019s become of the boy?\u201d said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. \u201cSpeak out, or I\u2019ll throttle you!\u201d Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, well sustained, and continuous roar\u2014something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet. \u201cWill you speak?\u201d thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous. \u201cWhy, the traps have got him, and that\u2019s all about it,\u201d said the Dodger, sullenly. \u201cCome, let go o\u2019 me, will you!\u201d And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew\u2019s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman\u2019s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced. The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant\u2019s head. But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman. \u201cWhy, what the blazes is in the wind now!\u201d growled a deep voice. \u201cWho pitched that \u2019ere at me? It\u2019s well it\u2019s the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I\u2019d have settled somebody. I might have know\u2019d, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water\u2014and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter. Wot\u2019s it all about, Fagin? D\u2014me, if my neck handkercher an\u2019t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master! Come in!\u201d The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly built fellow of about five and thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;\u2014the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days\u2019 growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow. \u201cCome in, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d growled this engaging ruffian. A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in afore?\u201d said the man. \u201cYou\u2019re getting too proud to own me afore company, are you? Lie down!\u201d This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very ill looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment. \u201cWhat are you up to? Ill treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in sa ti a ble old fence?\u201d said the man, seating himself deliberately. \u201cI wonder they don\u2019t murder you! I would if I was them. If I\u2019d been your \u2019prentice, I\u2019d have done it long ago, and\u2014no, I couldn\u2019t have sold you afterwards, for you\u2019re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don\u2019t blow glass bottles large enough.\u201d \u201cHush! hush! Mr. Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, trembling; \u201cdon\u2019t speak so loud!\u201d \u201cNone of your mistering,\u201d replied the ruffian; \u201cyou always mean mischief when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan\u2019t disgrace it when the time comes.\u201d \u201cWell, well, then\u2014Bill Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, with abject humility. \u201cYou seem out of humour, Bill.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I am,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and\u2014\u201d \u201cAre you mad?\u201d said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys. Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor. \u201cAnd mind you don\u2019t poison it,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the table. This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller\u2019s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman\u2019s merry heart. After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver\u2019s capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances. \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cthat he may say something which will get us into trouble.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very likely,\u201d returned Sikes with a malicious grin. \u201cYou\u2019re blowed upon, Fagin.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid, you see,\u201d added the Jew, speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.\u201d The man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman\u2019s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall. There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out. \u201cSomebody must find out wot\u2019s been done at the office,\u201d said Mr. Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in. The Jew nodded assent. \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t peached, and is committed, there\u2019s no fear till he comes out again,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, \u201cand then he must be taken care on. You must get hold of him somehow.\u201d Again the Jew nodded. The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted. This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any ground or pretext whatever. How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess. It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh. \u201cThe very thing!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cBet will go; won\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d \u201cWheres?\u201d inquired the young lady. \u201cOnly just up to the office, my dear,\u201d said the Jew coaxingly. It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be \u201cblessed\u201d if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal. The Jew\u2019s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl papers, to the other female. \u201cNancy, my dear,\u201d said the Jew in a soothing manner, \u201cwhat do _you_ say?\u201d \u201cThat it won\u2019t do; so it\u2019s no use a trying it on, Fagin,\u201d replied Nancy. \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner. \u201cWhat I say, Bill,\u201d replied the lady collectedly. \u201cWhy, you\u2019re just the very person for it,\u201d reasoned Mr. Sikes: \u201cnobody about here knows anything of you.\u201d \u201cAnd as I don\u2019t want \u2019em to, neither,\u201d replied Nancy in the same composed manner, \u201cit\u2019s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll go, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cNo, she won\u2019t, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy. \u201cYes, she will, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes. And Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances. Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,\u2014both articles of dress being provided from the Jew\u2019s inexhaustible stock,\u2014Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand. \u201cStop a minute, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket. \u201cCarry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my dear.\u201d \u201cGive her a door key to carry in her t\u2019other one, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cit looks real and genivine like.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, my dear, so it does,\u201d said the Jew, hanging a large street door key on the forefinger of the young lady\u2019s right hand. \u201cThere; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, rubbing his hands. \u201cOh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!\u201d exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street door key in an agony of distress. \u201cWhat has become of him! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what\u2019s been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!\u201d Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared. \u201cAh, she\u2019s a clever girl, my dears,\u201d said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld. \u201cShe\u2019s a honour to her sex,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist. \u201cHere\u2019s her health, and wishing they was all like her!\u201d While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards. Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke. \u201cNolly, dear?\u201d murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; \u201cNolly?\u201d There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument. He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there. \u201cWell!\u201d cried a faint and feeble voice. \u201cIs there a little boy here?\u201d inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob. \u201cNo,\u201d replied the voice; \u201cGod forbid.\u201d This was a vagrant of sixty five, who was going to prison for _not_ playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp office. But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother. \u201cI haven\u2019t got him, my dear,\u201d said the old man. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner. \u201cWhy, the gentleman\u2019s got him,\u201d replied the officer. \u201cWhat gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?\u201d exclaimed Nancy. In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman. In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew. Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good morning. \u201cWe must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,\u201d said the Jew greatly excited. \u201cCharley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust to you, my dear,\u2014to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,\u201d added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; \u201cthere\u2019s money, my dears. I shall shut up this shop tonight. You\u2019ll know where to find me! Don\u2019t stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!\u201d With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver. Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing. A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he cried in a shrill tone. \u201cMe!\u201d replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key hole. \u201cWhat now?\u201d cried the Jew impatiently. \u201cIs he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?\u201d inquired the Dodger. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cwherever she lays hands on him. Find him, find him out, that\u2019s all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.\u201d The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his companions. \u201cHe has not peached so far,\u201d said the Jew as he pursued his occupation. \u201cIf he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.\u201d CHAPTER XIV. COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER\u2019S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW\u2019S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND Oliver soon recovering from the fainting fit into which Mr. Brownlow\u2019s abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver\u2019s history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the housekeeper\u2019s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady. His expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed. \u201cAh!\u201d said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt is gone, you see.\u201d \u201cI see it is ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWhy have they taken it away?\u201d \u201cIt has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,\u201d rejoined the old lady. \u201cOh, no, indeed. It didn\u2019t worry me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI liked to see it. I quite loved it.\u201d \u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old lady, good humouredly; \u201cyou get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise you that! Now, let us talk about something else.\u201d This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six and twenty years, it was time to have tea. After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed. They were happy days, those of Oliver\u2019s recovery. Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself. This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again. They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before. One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while. \u201cBless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,\u201d said Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cDear heart alive! If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!\u201d Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn\u2019t think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better. Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens. There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down. Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser. Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives. \u201cThere are a good many books, are there not, my boy?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling. \u201cA great number, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI never saw so many.\u201d \u201cYou shall read them, if you behave well,\u201d said the old gentleman kindly; \u201cand you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,\u2014that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.\u201d \u201cI suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,\u201d said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding. \u201cNot always those,\u201d said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; \u201cthere are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?\u201d \u201cI think I would rather read them, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWhat! wouldn\u2019t you like to be a book writer?\u201d said the old gentleman. Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing. Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said the old gentleman, composing his features. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! We won\u2019t make an author of you, while there\u2019s an honest trade to be learnt, or brick making to turn to.\u201d \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to. \u201cNow,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, \u201cI want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman\u2019s commencement! \u201cDon\u2019t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again. Let me stay here, and be a servant. Don\u2019t send me back to the wretched place I came from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!\u201d \u201cMy dear child,\u201d said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver\u2019s sudden appeal; \u201cyou need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.\u201d \u201cI never, never will, sir,\u201d interposed Oliver. \u201cI hope not,\u201d rejoined the old gentleman. \u201cI do not think you ever will. I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections. Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.\u201d As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still. \u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, \u201cI only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement. Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you. Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.\u201d Oliver\u2019s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double knock was heard at the street door: and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig. \u201cIs he coming up?\u201d inquired Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied the servant. \u201cHe asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.\u201d Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know. \u201cShall I go downstairs, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cI would rather you remained here.\u201d At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green. A very small plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it. The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description. He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot. In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange peel at arm\u2019s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice, \u201cLook here! do you see this! Isn\u2019t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can\u2019t call at a man\u2019s house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon\u2019s friend on the staircase? I\u2019ve been lamed with orange peel once, and I know orange peel will be my death, or I\u2019ll be content to eat my own head, sir!\u201d This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig\u2019s head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting\u2014to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder. \u201cI\u2019ll eat my head, sir,\u201d repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground. \u201cHallo! what\u2019s that!\u201d looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two. \u201cThis is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. Oliver bowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s the boy who had the fever, I hope?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more. \u201cWait a minute! Don\u2019t speak! Stop\u2014\u201d continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; \u201cthat\u2019s the boy who had the orange! If that\u2019s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I\u2019ll eat my head, and his too.\u201d \u201cNo, no, he has not had one,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. \u201cCome! Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.\u201d \u201cI feel strongly on this subject, sir,\u201d said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his gloves. \u201cThere\u2019s always more or less orange peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it\u2019s put there by the surgeon\u2019s boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime light. \u2018Don\u2019t go to him,\u2019 I called out of the window, \u2018he\u2019s an assassin! A man trap!\u2019 So he is. If he is not\u2014\u201d Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again. \u201cThat\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, at length. \u201cThat\u2019s the boy,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cHow are you, boy?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig. \u201cA great deal better, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor\u2019s manner, he was very happy to do. \u201cHe is a nice looking boy, is he not?\u201d inquired Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly. \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew two sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef faced boys.\u201d \u201cAnd which is Oliver?\u201d \u201cMealy. I know a friend who has a beef faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. I know him! The wretch!\u201d \u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cthese are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn\u2019t excite your wrath.\u201d \u201cThey are not,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig. \u201cHe may have worse.\u201d Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr. Grimwig the most exquisite delight. \u201cHe may have worse, I say,\u201d repeated Mr. Grimwig. \u201cWhere does he come from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven\u2019t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn\u2019t recommended to mercy on that account. Pooh! nonsense!\u201d Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr. Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver\u2019s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver\u2019s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn\u2019t find a table spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to\u2014and so forth. All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman: knowing his friend\u2019s peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman\u2019s presence. \u201cAnd when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?\u201d asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject. \u201cTomorrow morning,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI would rather he was alone with me at the time. Come up to me tomorrow morning at ten o\u2019clock, my dear.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation, because he was confused by Mr. Grimwig\u2019s looking so hard at him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; \u201che won\u2019t come up to you tomorrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is deceiving you, my good friend.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll swear he is not,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly. \u201cIf he is not,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d and down went the stick. \u201cI\u2019ll answer for that boy\u2019s truth with my life!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, knocking the table. \u201cAnd I for his falsehood with my head!\u201d rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the table also. \u201cWe shall see,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger. \u201cWe will,\u201d replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; \u201cwe will.\u201d As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room. \u201cStop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cthere is something to go back.\u201d \u201cHe has gone, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Bedwin. \u201cCall after him,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cit\u2019s particular. He is a poor man, and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back, too.\u201d The street door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him. \u201cDear me, I am very sorry for that,\u201d exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; \u201cI particularly wished those books to be returned tonight.\u201d \u201cSend Oliver with them,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; \u201che will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.\u201d \u201cYes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI\u2019ll run all the way, sir.\u201d The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once. \u201cYou _shall_ go, my dear,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThe books are on a chair by my table. Fetch them down.\u201d Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take. \u201cYou are to say,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; \u201cyou are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t be ten minutes, sir,\u201d said Oliver, eagerly. Having buttoned up the bank note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin followed him to the street door, giving him many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood. Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart. \u201cBless his sweet face!\u201d said the old lady, looking after him. \u201cI can\u2019t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.\u201d At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room. \u201cLet me see; he\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. \u201cIt will be dark by that time.\u201d \u201cOh! you really expect him to come back, do you?\u201d inquired Mr. Grimwig. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling. The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig\u2019s breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend\u2019s confident smile. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiting the table with his fist, \u201cI do not. The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm, and a five pound note in his pocket. He\u2019ll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them. It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a bad hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back. It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them. CHAPTER XV. SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE In the obscure parlour of a low public house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas light burnt all day in the winter time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white coated, red eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict. \u201cKeep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!\u201d said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog\u2019s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously. Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes\u2019s dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head. \u201cYou would, would you?\u201d said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife, which he drew from his pocket. \u201cCome here, you born devil! Come here! D\u2019ye hear?\u201d The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast. This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp knife in his hands. There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr. Sikes, being disappointed of the dog\u2019s participation, at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer. \u201cWhat the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?\u201d said Sikes, with a fierce gesture. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, my dear, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer. \u201cDidn\u2019t know, you white livered thief!\u201d growled Sikes. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you hear the noise?\u201d \u201cNot a sound of it, as I\u2019m a living man, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cOh no! You hear nothing, you don\u2019t,\u201d retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer. \u201cSneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d inquired the Jew with a forced smile. \u201c\u2019Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven\u2019t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,\u201d replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; \u201cthat\u2019s why.\u201d The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at ease, however. \u201cGrin away,\u201d said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; \u201cgrin away. You\u2019ll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it\u2019s behind a nightcap. I\u2019ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d\u2014me, I\u2019ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.\u201d \u201cWell, well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cI know all that; we\u2014we\u2014have a mutual interest, Bill,\u2014a mutual interest.\u201d \u201cHumph,\u201d said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew\u2019s side than on his. \u201cWell, what have you got to say to me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all passed safe through the melting pot,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand this is your share. It\u2019s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you\u2019ll do me a good turn another time, and\u2014\u201d \u201cStow that gammon,\u201d interposed the robber, impatiently. \u201cWhere is it? Hand over!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,\u201d replied the Jew, soothingly. \u201cHere it is! All safe!\u201d As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained. \u201cThis is all, is it?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cAll,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cYou haven\u2019t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?\u201d inquired Sikes, suspiciously. \u201cDon\u2019t put on an injured look at the question; you\u2019ve done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.\u201d These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance. Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person. It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him. \u201cIs anybody here, Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin; speaking, now that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground. \u201cDot a shoul,\u201d replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose. \u201cNobody?\u201d inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth. \u201cDobody but Biss Dadsy,\u201d replied Barney. \u201cNancy!\u201d exclaimed Sikes. \u201cWhere? Strike me blind, if I don\u2019t honour that \u2019ere girl, for her native talents.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,\u201d replied Barney. \u201cSend her here,\u201d said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. \u201cSend her here.\u201d Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street door key, complete. \u201cYou are on the scent, are you, Nancy?\u201d inquired Sikes, proffering the glass. \u201cYes, I am, Bill,\u201d replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; \u201cand tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat\u2019s been ill and confined to the crib; and\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, Nancy, dear!\u201d said Fagin, looking up. Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew\u2019s red eye brows, and a half closing of his deeply set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes\u2019 time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back yard as soon as his master was out of sight. The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue and Cry. Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book stall. When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm. He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. \u201cOh, my dear brother!\u201d And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d cried Oliver, struggling. \u201cLet go of me. Who is it? What are you stopping me for?\u201d The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street door key in her hand. \u201cOh my gracious!\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI have found him! Oh! Oliver! Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I\u2019ve found him. Thank gracious goodness heavins, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher\u2019s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn\u2019t think he had better run for the doctor. To which, the butcher\u2019s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not. \u201cOh, no, no, never mind,\u201d said the young woman, grasping Oliver\u2019s hand; \u201cI\u2019m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!\u201d \u201cOh, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the young woman, \u201che ran away, near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother\u2019s heart.\u201d \u201cYoung wretch!\u201d said one woman. \u201cGo home, do, you little brute,\u201d said the other. \u201cI am not,\u201d replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I haven\u2019t any sister, or father and mother either. I\u2019m an orphan; I live at Pentonville.\u201d \u201cOnly hear him, how he braves it out!\u201d cried the young woman. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s Nancy!\u201d exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment. \u201cYou see he knows me!\u201d cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. \u201cHe can\u2019t help himself. Make him come home, there\u2019s good people, or he\u2019ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!\u201d \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d said a man, bursting out of a beer shop, with a white dog at his heels; \u201cyoung Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you young dog! Come home directly.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t belong to them. I don\u2019t know them. Help! help!\u201d cried Oliver, struggling in the man\u2019s powerful grasp. \u201cHelp!\u201d repeated the man. \u201cYes; I\u2019ll help you, you young rascal! What books are these? You\u2019ve been a stealing \u2019em, have you? Give \u2019em here.\u201d With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d cried a looker on, from a garret window. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way of bringing him to his senses!\u201d \u201cTo be sure!\u201d cried a sleepy faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret window. \u201cIt\u2019ll do him good!\u201d said the two women. \u201cAnd he shall have it, too!\u201d rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar. \u201cCome on, you young villain! Here, Bull\u2019s eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!\u201d Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless. In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain. The gas lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them. CHAPTER XVI. RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle market. Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you hear?\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round. They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers. Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers. \u201cGive me the other,\u201d said Sikes, seizing Oliver\u2019s unoccupied hand. \u201cHere, Bull\u2019s Eye!\u201d The dog looked up, and growled. \u201cSee here, boy!\u201d said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver\u2019s throat; \u201cif he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D\u2019ye mind!\u201d The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay. \u201cHe\u2019s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn\u2019t!\u201d said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. \u201cNow, you know what you\u2019ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young \u2019un!\u201d Bull\u2019s eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward. It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night was dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver\u2019s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing. They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church bell struck the hour. With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded. \u201cEight o\u2019clock, Bill,\u201d said Nancy, when the bell ceased. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can\u2019t I?\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cI wonder whether _they_ can hear it,\u201d said Nancy. \u201cOf course they can,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cIt was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn\u2019t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn\u2019t hear the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.\u201d \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded. \u201cOh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!\u201d \u201cYes; that\u2019s all you women think of,\u201d answered Sikes. \u201cFine young chaps! Well, they\u2019re as good as dead, so it don\u2019t much matter.\u201d With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver\u2019s wrist more firmly, told him to step out again. \u201cWait a minute!\u201d said the girl: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o\u2019clock struck, Bill. I\u2019d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn\u2019t a shawl to cover me.\u201d \u201cAnd what good would that do?\u201d inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes. \u201cUnless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me. Come on, and don\u2019t stand preaching there.\u201d The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white. They walked on, by little frequented and dirty ways, for a full half hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many years. \u201cAll right,\u201d cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about. Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell. They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house. The passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door. \u201cAnybody here?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cNo,\u201d replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before. \u201cIs the old \u2019un here?\u201d asked the robber. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the voice, \u201cand precious down in the mouth he has been. Won\u2019t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!\u201d The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver\u2019s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness. \u201cLet\u2019s have a glim,\u201d said Sikes, \u201cor we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!\u201d \u201cStand still a moment, and I\u2019ll get you one,\u201d replied the voice. The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick. The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back yard, were received with a shout of laughter. \u201cOh, my wig, my wig!\u201d cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded: \u201chere he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin, look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can\u2019t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I can\u2019t bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.\u201d With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver\u2019s pockets with steady assiduity. \u201cLook at his togs, Fagin!\u201d said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. \u201cLook at his togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!\u201d \u201cDelighted to see you looking so well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, bowing with mock humility. \u201cThe Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn\u2019t you write, my dear, and say you were coming? We\u2019d have got something warm for supper.\u201d At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment. \u201cHallo, what\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note. \u201cThat\u2019s mine, Fagin.\u201d \u201cNo, no, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cMine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.\u201d \u201cIf that ain\u2019t mine!\u201d said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; \u201cmine and Nancy\u2019s that is; I\u2019ll take the boy back again.\u201d The Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back. \u201cCome! Hand over, will you?\u201d said Sikes. \u201cThis is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?\u201d inquired the Jew. \u201cFair, or not fair,\u201d retorted Sikes, \u201chand over, I tell you! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!\u201d With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew\u2019s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief. \u201cThat\u2019s for our share of the trouble,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cand not half enough, neither. You may keep the books, if you\u2019re fond of reading. If you ain\u2019t, sell \u2019em.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re very pretty,\u201d said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; \u201cbeautiful writing, isn\u2019t is, Oliver?\u201d At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first. \u201cThey belong to the old gentleman,\u201d said Oliver, wringing his hands; \u201cto the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back. He\u2019ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!\u201d With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew\u2019s feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation. \u201cThe boy\u2019s right,\u201d remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Oliver, you\u2019re right; they _will_ think you have stolen \u2019em. Ha! ha!\u201d chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have happened better, if we had chosen our time!\u201d \u201cOf course it couldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI know\u2019d that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. It\u2019s all right enough. They\u2019re soft hearted psalm singers, or they wouldn\u2019t have taken him in at all; and they\u2019ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He\u2019s safe enough.\u201d Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof. \u201cKeep back the dog, Bill!\u201d cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. \u201cKeep back the dog; he\u2019ll tear the boy to pieces.\u201d \u201cServe him right!\u201d cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl\u2019s grasp. \u201cStand off from me, or I\u2019ll split your head against the wall.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care for that, Bill, I don\u2019t care for that,\u201d screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, \u201cthe child shan\u2019t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.\u201d \u201cShan\u2019t he!\u201d said Sikes, setting his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll soon do that, if you don\u2019t keep off.\u201d The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here!\u201d said Fagin, looking round. \u201cThe girl\u2019s gone mad, I think,\u201d replied Sikes, savagely. \u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; \u201cno, she hasn\u2019t, Fagin; don\u2019t think it.\u201d \u201cThen keep quiet, will you?\u201d said the Jew, with a threatening look. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t do that, neither,\u201d replied Nancy, speaking very loud. \u201cCome! What do you think of that?\u201d Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver. \u201cSo you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?\u201d said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; \u201ceh?\u201d Oliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew\u2019s motions, and breathed quickly. \u201cWanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?\u201d sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll cure you of that, my young master.\u201d The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver\u2019s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room. \u201cI won\u2019t stand by and see it done, Fagin,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the boy, and what more would you have?\u2014Let him be\u2014let him be\u2014or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.\u201d The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself. \u201cWhy, Nancy!\u201d said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; \u201cyou,\u2014you\u2019re more clever than ever tonight. Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d said the girl. \u201cTake care I don\u2019t overdo it. You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.\u201d There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy\u2019s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue. Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments. \u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: \u201cwhat do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are, and what you are?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I know all about it,\u201d replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference. \u201cWell, then, keep quiet,\u201d rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, \u201cor I\u2019ll quiet you for a good long time to come.\u201d The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice one,\u201d added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, \u201cto take up the humane and gen\u2014teel side! A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!\u201d \u201cGod Almighty help me, I am!\u201d cried the girl passionately; \u201cand I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here. He\u2019s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that\u2019s bad, from this night forth. Isn\u2019t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?\u201d \u201cCome, come, Sikes,\u201d said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; \u201cwe must have civil words; civil words, Bill.\u201d \u201cCivil words!\u201d cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. \u201cCivil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve \u2019em from me. I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!\u201d pointing to Oliver. \u201cI have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don\u2019t you know it? Speak out! Don\u2019t you know it?\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; \u201cand, if you have, it\u2019s your living!\u201d \u201cAye, it is!\u201d returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream. \u201cIt is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you\u2019re the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that\u2019ll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!\u201d \u201cI shall do you a mischief!\u201d interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; \u201ca mischief worse than that, if you say much more!\u201d The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted. \u201cShe\u2019s all right now,\u201d said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. \u201cShe\u2019s uncommon strong in the arms, when she\u2019s up in this way.\u201d The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst of having to do with women,\u201d said the Jew, replacing his club; \u201cbut they\u2019re clever, and we can\u2019t get on, in our line, without \u2019em. Charley, show Oliver to bed.\u201d \u201cI suppose he\u2019d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?\u201d inquired Charley Bates. \u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question. Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr. Brownlow\u2019s; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his whereabout. \u201cPut off the smart ones,\u201d said Charley, \u201cand I\u2019ll give \u2019em to Fagin to take care of. What fun it is!\u201d Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him. The noise of Charley\u2019s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep. CHAPTER XVII. OLIVER\u2019S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually. Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well spread boards to death beds, and from mourning weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous. As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author\u2019s skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition. Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle\u2019s mind, too great for utterance. Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care. \u201cDrat that beadle!\u201d said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well known shaking at the garden gate. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t him at this time in the morning! Lauk, Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it _is_ a pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.\u201d The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house. \u201cMrs. Mann,\u201d said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; \u201cMrs. Mann, ma\u2019am, good morning.\u201d \u201cWell, and good morning to _you_, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann, with many smiles; \u201cand hoping you find yourself well, sir!\u201d \u201cSo so, Mrs. Mann,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cA porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs. Mann.\u201d \u201cAh, that it isn\u2019t indeed, Mr. Bumble,\u201d rejoined the lady. And all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety, if they had heard it. \u201cA porochial life, ma\u2019am,\u201d continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with his cane, \u201cis a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.\u201d Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed. \u201cAh! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!\u201d said the beadle. Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said, \u201cMrs. Mann, I am going to London.\u201d \u201cLauk, Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried Mrs. Mann, starting back. \u201cTo London, ma\u2019am,\u201d resumed the inflexible beadle, \u201cby coach. I and two paupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and the board has appointed me\u2014me, Mrs. Mann\u2014to dispose to the matter before the quarter sessions at Clerkinwell. And I very much question,\u201d added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, \u201cwhether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.\u201d \u201cOh! you mustn\u2019t be too hard upon them, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly. \u201cThe Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble; \u201cand if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.\u201d There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs. Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019re ill, Mrs. Mann,\u201d said the beadle. \u201cWe put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs. Mann. \u201cThe opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThey are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move \u2019em than to bury \u2019em\u2014that is, if we can throw \u2019em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don\u2019t die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave. \u201cWe are forgetting business, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle; \u201chere is your porochial stipend for the month.\u201d Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s very much blotted, sir,\u201d said the farmer of infants; \u201cbut it\u2019s formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann\u2019s curtsey; and inquired how the children were. \u201cBless their dear little hearts!\u201d said Mrs. Mann with emotion, \u201cthey\u2019re as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last week. And little Dick.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that boy no better?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble. Mrs. Mann shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s a ill conditioned, wicious, bad disposed porochial child that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble angrily. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,\u201d replied Mrs. Mann. \u201cHere, you Dick!\u201d After some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann\u2019s gown, he was led into the awful presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle. The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man. Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble\u2019s glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle\u2019s voice. \u201cCan\u2019t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?\u201d said Mrs. Mann. The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, porochial Dick?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble, with well timed jocularity. \u201cNothing, sir,\u201d replied the child faintly. \u201cI should think not,\u201d said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr. Bumble\u2019s humour. \u201cYou want for nothing, I\u2019m sure.\u201d \u201cI should like\u2014\u201d faltered the child. \u201cHey day!\u201d interposed Mrs. Mann, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to say that you _do_ want for something, now? Why, you little wretch\u2014\u201d \u201cStop, Mrs. Mann, stop!\u201d said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of authority. \u201cLike what, sir, eh?\u201d \u201cI should like,\u201d faltered the child, \u201cif somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.\u201d \u201cWhy, what does the boy mean?\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as he was to such things. \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI should like,\u201d said the child, \u201cto leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him. And I should like to tell him,\u201d said the child pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, \u201cthat I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.\u201d Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, \u201cThey\u2019re all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t have believed it, sir\u201d said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick. \u201cI never see such a hardened little wretch!\u201d \u201cTake him away, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr. Bumble imperiously. \u201cThis must be stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.\u201d \u201cI hope the gentleman will understand that it isn\u2019t my fault, sir?\u201d said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically. \u201cThey shall understand that, ma\u2019am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThere; take him away, I can\u2019t bear the sight on him.\u201d Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal cellar. Mr. Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey. At six o\u2019clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great coat with a cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London. He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a great coat on. Having disposed of these evil minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass of hot gin and water on the chimney piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper. The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble\u2019s eye rested, was the following advertisement. \u201cFIVE GUINEAS REWARD \u201cWhereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of. The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.\u201d And then followed a full description of Oliver\u2019s dress, person, appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow at full length. Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin and water, untasted. \u201cIs Mr. Brownlow at home?\u201d inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the door. To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of \u201cI don\u2019t know; where do you come from?\u201d Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver\u2019s name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state. \u201cCome in, come in,\u201d said the old lady: \u201cI knew we should hear of him. Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I said so all along.\u201d Having said this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did. He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation: \u201cA beadle. A parish beadle, or I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d \u201cPray don\u2019t interrupt just now,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cTake a seat, will you?\u201d Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr. Grimwig\u2019s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle\u2019s countenance; and said, with a little impatience, \u201cNow, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cAnd you _are_ a beadle, are you not?\u201d inquired Mr. Grimwig. \u201cI am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly. \u201cOf course,\u201d observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, \u201cI knew he was. A beadle all over!\u201d Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed: \u201cDo you know where this poor boy is now?\u201d \u201cNo more than nobody,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cWell, what _do_ you know of him?\u201d inquired the old gentleman. \u201cSpeak out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What _do_ you know of him?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know any good of him, do you?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble\u2019s features. Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity. \u201cYou see?\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow. Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble\u2019s pursed up countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible. Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments\u2019 reflection, commenced his story. It would be tedious if given in the beadle\u2019s words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents. That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice. That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night time from his master\u2019s house. In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow\u2019s observations. \u201cI fear it is all too true,\u201d said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers. \u201cThis is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.\u201d It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew. Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle\u2019s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him further. At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently. \u201cMrs. Bedwin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; \u201cthat boy, Oliver, is an imposter.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t be, sir. It cannot be,\u201d said the old lady energetically. \u201cI tell you he is,\u201d retorted the old gentleman. \u201cWhat do you mean by can\u2019t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough paced little villain, all his life.\u201d \u201cI never will believe it, sir,\u201d replied the old lady, firmly. \u201cNever!\u201d \u201cYou old women never believe anything but quack doctors, and lying story books,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig. \u201cI knew it all along. Why didn\u2019t you take my advice in the beginning; you would if he hadn\u2019t had a fever, I suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn\u2019t he? Interesting! Bah!\u201d And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish. \u201cHe was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,\u201d retorted Mrs. Bedwin, indignantly. \u201cI know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can\u2019t say the same, shouldn\u2019t say anything about them. That\u2019s my opinion!\u201d This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr. Brownlow. \u201cSilence!\u201d said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from feeling. \u201cNever let me hear the boy\u2019s name again. I rang to tell you that. Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin. Remember! I am in earnest.\u201d There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow\u2019s that night. Oliver\u2019s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright. CHAPTER XVIII. HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr. Fagin) and a few select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation. Little Oliver\u2019s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew\u2019s words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind. As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew\u2019s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman. The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old patched great coat, he went out, and locked the room door behind him. And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed. After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house. It was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now. Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned. In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There was a back garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable ends. Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver\u2019s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,\u2014which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway. Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal. So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated as \u201cjapanning his trotter cases.\u201d The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots. Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature. He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sigh, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates: \u201cWhat a pity it is he isn\u2019t a prig!\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Master Charles Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him.\u201d The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates. They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence. \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t even know what a prig is?\u201d said the Dodger mournfully. \u201cI think I know that,\u201d replied Oliver, looking up. \u201cIt\u2019s a the\u2014; you\u2019re one, are you not?\u201d inquired Oliver, checking himself. \u201cI am,\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cI\u2019d scorn to be anything else.\u201d Mr. Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary. \u201cI am,\u201d repeated the Dodger. \u201cSo\u2019s Charley. So\u2019s Fagin. So\u2019s Sikes. So\u2019s Nancy. So\u2019s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he\u2019s the downiest one of the lot!\u201d \u201cAnd the least given to peaching,\u201d added Charley Bates. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t so much as bark in a witness box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight,\u201d said the Dodger. \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d observed Charley. \u201cHe\u2019s a rum dog. Don\u2019t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he\u2019s in company!\u201d pursued the Dodger. \u201cWon\u2019t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don\u2019t he hate other dogs as ain\u2019t of his breed! Oh, no!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s an out and out Christian,\u201d said Charley. This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal\u2019s abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out and out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes\u2019 dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t got anything to do with young Green here.\u201d \u201cNo more it has,\u201d said Charley. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?\u201d \u201cAnd make your fortun\u2019 out of hand?\u201d added the Dodger, with a grin. \u201cAnd so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen teel: as I mean to, in the very next leap year but four that ever comes, and the forty second Tuesday in Trinity week,\u201d said Charley Bates. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d rejoined Oliver, timidly; \u201cI wish they would let me go. I\u2014I\u2014would rather go.\u201d \u201cAnd Fagin would _rather_ not!\u201d rejoined Charley. Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot cleaning. \u201cGo!\u201d exclaimed the Dodger. \u201cWhy, where\u2019s your spirit? Don\u2019t you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, blow that!\u201d said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, \u201cthat\u2019s too mean; that is.\u201d \u201c_I_ couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust. \u201cYou can leave your friends, though,\u201d said Oliver with a half smile; \u201cand let them be punished for what you did.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, \u201cThat was all out of consideration for Fagin, \u2019cause the traps know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn\u2019t made our lucky; that was the move, wasn\u2019t it, Charley?\u201d Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver\u2019s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long. \u201cLook here!\u201d said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence. \u201cHere\u2019s a jolly life! What\u2019s the odds where it comes from? Here, catch hold; there\u2019s plenty more where they were took from. You won\u2019t, won\u2019t you? Oh, you precious flat!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s naughty, ain\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d inquired Charley Bates. \u201cHe\u2019ll come to be scragged, won\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cSomething in this way, old feller,\u201d said Charley. As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing. \u201cThat\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Charley. \u201cLook how he stares, Jack! I never did see such prime company as that \u2019ere boy; he\u2019ll be the death of me, I know he will.\u201d Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve been brought up bad,\u201d said the Dodger, surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. \u201cFagin will make something of you, though, or you\u2019ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable. You\u2019d better begin at once; for you\u2019ll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you\u2019re only losing time, Oliver.\u201d Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin\u2019s favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it. \u201cAnd always put this in your pipe, Nolly,\u201d said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, \u201cif you don\u2019t take fogels and tickers\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way?\u201d interposed Master Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t take pocket handkechers and watches,\u201d said the Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver\u2019s capacity, \u201csome other cove will; so that the coves that lose \u2019em will be all the worse, and you\u2019ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha\u2019p\u2019orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them\u2014and you\u2019ve just as good a right to them as they have.\u201d \u201cTo be sure, to be sure!\u201d said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver. \u201cIt all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger\u2019s word for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his trade.\u201d The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the Dodger\u2019s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil\u2019s proficiency. The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance. Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements. He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron. His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his \u201ctime\u201d was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes. Mr. Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the county. The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty two moral long hard working days; and that he \u201cwished he might be busted if he warn\u2019t as dry as a lime basket.\u201d \u201cWhere do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver. \u201cA young friend of mine, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cHe\u2019s in luck, then,\u201d said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin. \u201cNever mind where I came from, young \u2019un; you\u2019ll find your way there, soon enough, I\u2019ll bet a crown!\u201d At this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew. After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers. These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself. At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two. Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose. From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver\u2019s, Mr. Fagin best knew. At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings. In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever. CHAPTER XIX. IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could. The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields. The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal. He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely populated quarter. The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs. A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room door; and a man\u2019s voice demanded who was there. \u201cOnly me, Bill; only me, my dear,\u201d said the Jew looking in. \u201cBring in your body then,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cLie down, you stupid brute! Don\u2019t you know the devil when he\u2019s got a great coat on?\u201d Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin\u2019s outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be. \u201cWell!\u201d said Sikes. \u201cWell, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\u2014\u201cAh! Nancy.\u201d The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady\u2019s behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake. \u201cIt _is_ cold, Nancy dear,\u201d said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire. \u201cIt seems to go right through one,\u201d added the old man, touching his side. \u201cIt must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,\u201d said Mr. Sikes. \u201cGive him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make haste! It\u2019s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.\u201d Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off. \u201cQuite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it. \u201cWhat! You\u2019re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. \u201cUgh!\u201d With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once. The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a \u201clife preserver\u201d that hung over the chimney piece. \u201cThere,\u201d said Sikes, smacking his lips. \u201cNow I\u2019m ready.\u201d \u201cFor business?\u201d inquired the Jew. \u201cFor business,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cso say what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d \u201cAbout the crib at Chertsey, Bill?\u201d said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice. \u201cYes. Wot about it?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cAh! you know what I mean, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cHe knows what I mean, Nancy; don\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cNo, he don\u2019t,\u201d sneered Mr. Sikes. \u201cOr he won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the same thing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don\u2019t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn\u2019t the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d \u201cHush, Bill, hush!\u201d said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; \u201csomebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will hear us.\u201d \u201cLet \u2019em hear!\u201d said Sikes; \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d But as Mr. Sikes _did_ care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer. \u201cThere, there,\u201d said the Jew, coaxingly. \u201cIt was only my caution, nothing more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such plate!\u201d said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation. \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Sikes coldly. \u201cNot to be done at all!\u201d echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cAt least it can\u2019t be a put up job, as we expected.\u201d \u201cThen it hasn\u2019t been properly gone about,\u201d said the Jew, turning pale with anger. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d \u201cBut I will tell you,\u201d retorted Sikes. \u201cWho are you that\u2019s not to be told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can\u2019t get one of the servants in line.\u201d \u201cDo you mean to tell me, Bill,\u201d said the Jew: softening as the other grew heated: \u201cthat neither of the two men in the house can be got over?\u201d \u201cYes, I do mean to tell you so,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cThe old lady has had \u2019em these twenty years; and if you were to give \u2019em five hundred pound, they wouldn\u2019t be in it.\u201d \u201cBut do you mean to say, my dear,\u201d remonstrated the Jew, \u201cthat the women can\u2019t be got over?\u201d \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cNot by flash Toby Crackit?\u201d said the Jew incredulously. \u201cThink what women are, Bill,\u201d \u201cNo; not even by flash Toby Crackit,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cHe says he\u2019s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he\u2019s been loitering down there, and it\u2019s all of no use.\u201d \u201cHe should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cSo he did,\u201d rejoined Sikes, \u201cand they warn\u2019t of no more use than the other plant.\u201d The Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, \u201cit\u2019s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d said Mr. Sikes. \u201cWorse luck!\u201d A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time. Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed. \u201cFagin,\u201d said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; \u201cis it worth fifty shiners extra, if it\u2019s safely done from the outside?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself. \u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cYes, my dear, yes,\u201d rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened. \u201cThen,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew\u2019s hand, with some disdain, \u201clet it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the garden wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters. The crib\u2019s barred up at night like a jail; but there\u2019s one part we can crack, safe and softly.\u201d \u201cWhich is that, Bill?\u201d asked the Jew eagerly. \u201cWhy,\u201d whispered Sikes, \u201cas you cross the lawn\u2014\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it. \u201cUmph!\u201d cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew\u2019s face. \u201cNever mind which part it is. You can\u2019t do it without me, I know; but it\u2019s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.\u201d \u201cAs you like, my dear, as you like\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cIs there no help wanted, but yours and Toby\u2019s?\u201d \u201cNone,\u201d said Sikes, \u201c\u2019cept a centre bit and a boy. The first we\u2019ve both got; the second you must find us.\u201d \u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed the Jew. \u201cOh! then it\u2019s a panel, eh?\u201d \u201cNever mind wot it is!\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cI want a boy, and he musn\u2019t be a big \u2019un. Lord!\u201d said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, \u201cif I\u2019d only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley sweeper\u2019s! He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a \u2019prentice of him. And so they go on,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, \u201cso they go on; and, if they\u2019d got money enough (which it\u2019s a Providence they haven\u2019t,) we shouldn\u2019t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.\u201d \u201cNo more we should,\u201d acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. \u201cBill!\u201d \u201cWhat now?\u201d inquired Sikes. The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room. Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want any beer,\u201d said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her seat very composedly. \u201cI tell you I do!\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cNonsense,\u201d rejoined the girl coolly, \u201cGo on, Fagin. I know what he\u2019s going to say, Bill; he needn\u2019t mind me.\u201d The Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise. \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?\u201d he asked at length. \u201cYou\u2019ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil\u2019s in it. She ain\u2019t one to blab. Are you Nancy?\u201d \u201c_I_ should think not!\u201d replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it. \u201cNo, no, my dear, I know you\u2019re not,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cbut\u2014\u201d and again the old man paused. \u201cBut wot?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether she mightn\u2019t p\u2019r\u2019aps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,\u201d replied the Jew. At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of \u201cKeep the game a going!\u201d \u201cNever say die!\u201d and the like. These seemed to have the effect of re assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise. \u201cNow, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy with a laugh. \u201cTell Bill at once, about Oliver!\u201d \u201cHa! you\u2019re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!\u201d said the Jew, patting her on the neck. \u201cIt _was_ about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d \u201cWhat about him?\u201d demanded Sikes. \u201cHe\u2019s the boy for you, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully. \u201cHe!\u201d exclaimed Sikes. \u201cHave him, Bill!\u201d said Nancy. \u201cI would, if I was in your place. He mayn\u2019t be so much up, as any of the others; but that\u2019s not what you want, if he\u2019s only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he\u2019s a safe one, Bill.\u201d \u201cI know he is,\u201d rejoined Fagin. \u201cHe\u2019s been in good training these last few weeks, and it\u2019s time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the others are all too big.\u201d \u201cWell, he is just the size I want,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, ruminating. \u201cAnd will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,\u201d interposed the Jew; \u201che can\u2019t help himself. That is, if you frighten him enough.\u201d \u201cFrighten him!\u201d echoed Sikes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be no sham frightening, mind you. If there\u2019s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound. You won\u2019t see him alive again, Fagin. Think of that, before you send him. Mark my words!\u201d said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of it all,\u201d said the Jew with energy. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve had my eye upon him, my dears, close\u2014close. Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he\u2019s ours! Ours for his life. Oho! It couldn\u2019t have come about better!\u201d The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy. \u201cOurs!\u201d said Sikes. \u201cYours, you mean.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I do, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. \u201cMine, if you like, Bill.\u201d \u201cAnd wot,\u201d said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, \u201cwot makes you take so much pains about one chalk faced kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose from?\u201d \u201cBecause they\u2019re of no use to me, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, with some confusion, \u201cnot worth the taking. Their looks convict \u2019em when they get into trouble, and I lose \u2019em all. With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn\u2019t with twenty of them. Besides,\u201d said the Jew, recovering his self possession, \u201che has us now if he could only give us leg bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us. Never mind how he came there; it\u2019s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that\u2019s all I want. Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way\u2014which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.\u201d \u201cWhen is it to be done?\u201d asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin\u2019s affectation of humanity. \u201cAh, to be sure,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cwhen is it to be done, Bill?\u201d \u201cI planned with Toby, the night arter tomorrow,\u201d rejoined Sikes in a surly voice, \u201cif he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthere\u2019s no moon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cIt\u2019s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?\u201d asked the Jew. Sikes nodded. \u201cAnd about\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, ah, it\u2019s all planned,\u201d rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. \u201cNever mind particulars. You\u2019d better bring the boy here tomorrow night. I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting pot ready, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew\u2019s next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit. These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations. At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell. \u201cGood night, Nancy,\u201d said the Jew, muffling himself up as before. \u201cGood night.\u201d Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no flinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be. The Jew again bade her good night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs. \u201cAlways the way!\u201d muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward. \u201cThe worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts. Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!\u201d Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return. \u201cIs Oliver a bed? I want to speak to him,\u201d was his first remark as they descended the stairs. \u201cHours ago,\u201d replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. \u201cHere he is!\u201d The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed. \u201cNot now,\u201d said the Jew, turning softly away. \u201cTomorrow. Tomorrow.\u201d CHAPTER XX. WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night. \u201cTo\u2014to\u2014stop there, sir?\u201d asked Oliver, anxiously. \u201cNo, no, my dear. Not to stop there,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t like to lose you. Don\u2019t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again. Ha! ha! ha! We won\u2019t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear. Oh no, no!\u201d The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could. \u201cI suppose,\u201d said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, \u201cyou want to know what you\u2019re going to Bill\u2019s for\u2014eh, my dear?\u201d Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know. \u201cWhy, do you think?\u201d inquired Fagin, parrying the question. \u201cIndeed I don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cBah!\u201d said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy\u2019s face. \u201cWait till Bill tells you, then.\u201d The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver\u2019s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin\u2019s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then. He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad. \u201cYou may burn a candle,\u201d said the Jew, putting one upon the table. \u201cAnd here\u2019s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you. Good night!\u201d \u201cGood night!\u201d replied Oliver, softly. The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name. Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it. He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room. \u201cTake heed, Oliver! take heed!\u201d said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner. \u201cHe\u2019s a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he bids you. Mind!\u201d Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room. Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The more he thought of the Jew\u2019s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning. He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely. He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read. He turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume. It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony. Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of. The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead. In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him. Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt. He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that!\u201d he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cMe. Only me,\u201d replied a tremulous voice. Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It was Nancy. \u201cPut down the light,\u201d said the girl, turning away her head. \u201cIt hurts my eyes.\u201d Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill. The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply. \u201cGod forgive me!\u201d she cried after a while, \u201cI never thought of this.\u201d \u201cHas anything happened?\u201d asked Oliver. \u201cCan I help you? I will if I can. I will, indeed.\u201d She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath. \u201cNancy!\u201d cried Oliver, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold. Oliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round. \u201cI don\u2019t know what comes over me sometimes,\u201d said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; \u201cit\u2019s this damp dirty room, I think. Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?\u201d \u201cAm I to go with you?\u201d asked Oliver. \u201cYes. I have come from Bill,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cYou are to go with me.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Oliver, recoiling. \u201cWhat for?\u201d echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy\u2019s face. \u201cOh! For no harm.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Oliver: who had watched her closely. \u201cHave it your own way,\u201d rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. \u201cFor no good, then.\u201d Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl\u2019s better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o\u2019clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale. As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready. Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion. She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts. \u201cHush!\u201d said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round. \u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself. I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.\u201d Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness. \u201cI have saved you from being ill used once, and I will again, and I do now,\u201d continued the girl aloud; \u201cfor those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.\u201d She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity: \u201cRemember this! And don\u2019t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don\u2019t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!\u201d She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out. A hackney cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant. The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew\u2019s steps had been directed on the previous evening. For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl\u2019s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut. \u201cThis way,\u201d said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time. \u201cBill!\u201d \u201cHallo!\u201d replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle. \u201cOh! That\u2019s the time of day. Come on!\u201d This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes\u2019 temperament. Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially. \u201cBull\u2019s eye\u2019s gone home with Tom,\u201d observed Sikes, as he lighted them up. \u201cHe\u2019d have been in the way.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d rejoined Nancy. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got the kid,\u201d said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke. \u201cYes, here he is,\u201d replied Nancy. \u201cDid he come quiet?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cLike a lamb,\u201d rejoined Nancy. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; \u201cfor the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it. Come here, young \u2019un; and let me read you a lectur\u2019, which is as well got over at once.\u201d Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver\u2019s cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him. \u201cNow, first: do you know wot this is?\u201d inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket pistol which lay on the table. Oliver replied in the affirmative. \u201cWell, then, look here,\u201d continued Sikes. \u201cThis is powder; that \u2019ere\u2019s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin\u2019.\u201d Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation. \u201cNow it\u2019s loaded,\u201d said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished. \u201cYes, I see it is, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cWell,\u201d said the robber, grasping Oliver\u2019s wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; \u201cif you speak a word when you\u2019re out o\u2019doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice. So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.\u201d Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr. Sikes continued. \u201cAs near as I know, there isn\u2019t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn\u2019t take this devil and all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn\u2019t for your own good. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d \u201cThe short and the long of what you mean,\u201d said Nancy: speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words: \u201cis, that if you\u2019re crossed by him in this job you have on hand, you\u2019ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; \u201cwomen can always put things in fewest words.\u2014Except when it\u2019s blowing up; and then they lengthens it out. And now that he\u2019s thoroughly up to it, let\u2019s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.\u201d In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep\u2019s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of \u201cjemmies\u201d being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four score oaths during the whole progress of the meal. Supper being ended\u2014it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it\u2014Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time. For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light. Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep. When he awoke, the table was covered with tea things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great coat, which hung over the back of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast. It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy. \u201cNow, then!\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; \u201chalf past five! Look sharp, or you\u2019ll get no breakfast; for it\u2019s late as it is.\u201d Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready. Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side pocket of his great coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away. Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it. CHAPTER XXI. THE EXPEDITION It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house tops, and dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty. By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time. The public houses, with gas lights burning inside, were already open. By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with. Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish baskets on their heads; donkey carts laden with vegetables; chaise carts filled with live stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle. It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun. Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement. It was market morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep. Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses. Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn. \u201cNow, young \u2019un!\u201d said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew\u2019s Church, \u201chard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don\u2019t lag behind already, Lazy legs!\u201d Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion\u2019s wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house breaker as well as he could. They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up. Seeing \u201cHounslow\u201d written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth. \u201cJump up,\u201d said the man. \u201cIs that your boy?\u201d \u201cYes; he\u2019s my boy,\u201d replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was. \u201cYour father walks rather too quick for you, don\u2019t he, my man?\u201d inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath. \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes, interposing. \u201cHe\u2019s used to it. Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!\u201d Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself. As they passed the different mile stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey. At length, they came to a public house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off. And here, the cart stopped. Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and rapped the side pocket with his fist, in a significant manner. \u201cGood bye, boy,\u201d said the man. \u201cHe\u2019s sulky,\u201d replied Sikes, giving him a shake; \u201che\u2019s sulky. A young dog! Don\u2019t mind him.\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d rejoined the other, getting into his cart. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine day, after all.\u201d And he drove away. Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey. They turned round to the left, a short way past the public house; and then, taking a right hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen\u2019s houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, \u201cHampton.\u201d They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours. At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public house with a defaced sign board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire. The kitchen was an old, low roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock frocks, drinking and smoking. They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company. They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr. Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further. Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep. It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale. \u201cSo, you\u2019re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the man, who seemed a little the worse\u2014or better, as the case might be\u2014for drinking; \u201cand not slow about it neither. My horse hasn\u2019t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin\u2019; and he won\u2019t be long a doing of it. Here\u2019s luck to him. Ecod! he\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d \u201cCould you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?\u201d demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend. \u201cIf you\u2019re going directly, I can,\u201d replied the man, looking out of the pot. \u201cAre you going to Halliford?\u201d \u201cGoing on to Shepperton,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cI\u2019m your man, as far as I go,\u201d replied the other. \u201cIs all paid, Becky?\u201d \u201cYes, the other gentleman\u2019s paid,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI say!\u201d said the man, with tipsy gravity; \u201cthat won\u2019t do, you know.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d rejoined Sikes. \u201cYou\u2019re a going to accommodate us, and wot\u2019s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?\u201d The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was. After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start. The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two \u201cto bear him up,\u201d and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly. The night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene. As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a light in the ferry house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew tree with graves beneath it. There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind. It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead. Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road. Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on. They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge. Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left. \u201cThe water!\u201d thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. \u201cHe has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!\u201d He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed. There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible. The house was dark, dismantled: and, to all appearance, uninhabited. Sikes, with Oliver\u2019s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together. CHAPTER XXII. THE BURGLARY \u201cHallo!\u201d cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage. \u201cDon\u2019t make such a row,\u201d said Sikes, bolting the door. \u201cShow a glim, Toby.\u201d \u201cAha! my pal!\u201d cried the same voice. \u201cA glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.\u201d The speaker appeared to throw a boot jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake. \u201cDo you hear?\u201d cried the same voice. \u201cThere\u2019s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?\u201d A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public house on Saffron Hill. \u201cBister Sikes!\u201d exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; \u201ccub id, sir; cub id.\u201d \u201cHere! you get on first,\u201d said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him. \u201cQuicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.\u201d Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe. He was dressed in a smartly cut snuff coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings. He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction. \u201cBill, my boy!\u201d said this figure, turning his head towards the door, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you. I was almost afraid you\u2019d given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!\u201d Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was. \u201cThe boy. Only the boy!\u201d replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire. \u201cWud of Bister Fagid\u2019s lads,\u201d exclaimed Barney, with a grin. \u201cFagin\u2019s, eh!\u201d exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. \u201cWot an inwalable boy that\u2019ll make, for the old ladies\u2019 pockets in chapels! His mug is a fortin\u2019 to him.\u201d \u201cThere\u2014there\u2019s enough of that,\u201d interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear: at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment. \u201cNow,\u201d said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, \u201cif you\u2019ll give us something to eat and drink while we\u2019re waiting, you\u2019ll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you\u2019ll have to go out with us again tonight, though not very far off.\u201d Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarcely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him. \u201cHere,\u201d said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table, \u201cSuccess to the crack!\u201d He rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents. Mr. Sikes did the same. \u201cA drain for the boy,\u201d said Toby, half filling a wine glass. \u201cDown with it, innocence.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man\u2019s face; \u201cindeed, I\u2014\u201d \u201cDown with it!\u201d echoed Toby. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.\u201d \u201cHe had better!\u201d said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. \u201cBurn my body, if he isn\u2019t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!\u201d Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes. This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close outside the fender. They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half past one. In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets. \u201cBarkers for me, Barney,\u201d said Toby Crackit. \u201cHere they are,\u201d replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. \u201cYou loaded them yourself.\u201d \u201cAll right!\u201d replied Toby, stowing them away. \u201cThe persuaders?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got \u2019em,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cCrape, keys, centre bits, darkies\u2014nothing forgotten?\u201d inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat. \u201cAll right,\u201d rejoined his companion. \u201cBring them bits of timber, Barney. That\u2019s the time of day.\u201d With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney\u2019s hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver\u2019s cape. \u201cNow then!\u201d said Sikes, holding out his hand. Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose. \u201cTake his other hand, Toby,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cLook out, Barney.\u201d The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again. It was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver\u2019s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half frozen moisture that was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey. \u201cSlap through the town,\u201d whispered Sikes; \u201cthere\u2019ll be nobody in the way, tonight, to see us.\u201d Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at intervals from some bed room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody abroad. They had cleared the town, as the church bell struck two. Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling. \u201cThe boy next,\u201d said Toby. \u201cHoist him up; I\u2019ll catch hold of him.\u201d Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the house. And now, for the first time, Oliver, well nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees. \u201cGet up!\u201d murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; \u201cGet up, or I\u2019ll strew your brains upon the grass.\u201d \u201cOh! for God\u2019s sake let me go!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201clet me run away and die in the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!\u201d The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy\u2019s mouth, and dragged him to the house. \u201cHush!\u201d cried the man; \u201cit won\u2019t answer here. Say another word, and I\u2019ll do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open. He\u2019s game enough now, I\u2019ll engage. I\u2019ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.\u201d Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin\u2019s head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise. After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on its hinges. It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver\u2019s size, nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike\u2019s art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also. \u201cNow listen, you young limb,\u201d whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver\u2019s face; \u201cI\u2019m a going to put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a bolt at the top, you won\u2019t be able to reach,\u201d interposed Toby. \u201cStand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on \u2019em: which is the old lady\u2019s arms.\u201d \u201cKeep quiet, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes, with a threatening look. \u201cThe room door is open, is it?\u201d \u201cWide,\u201d replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. \u201cThe game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who\u2019s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney \u2019ticed him away tonight. So neat!\u201d Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside. \u201cTake this lantern,\u201d said Sikes, looking into the room. \u201cYou see the stairs afore you?\u201d Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, \u201cYes.\u201d Sikes, pointing to the street door with the pistol barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant. \u201cIt\u2019s done in a minute,\u201d said Sikes, in the same low whisper. \u201cDirectly I leave go of you, do your work. Hark!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d whispered the other man. They listened intently. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. \u201cNow!\u201d In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily. \u201cCome back!\u201d suddenly cried Sikes aloud. \u201cBack! back!\u201d Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly. The cry was repeated\u2014a light appeared\u2014a vision of two terrified half dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes\u2014a flash\u2014a loud noise\u2014a smoke\u2014a crash somewhere, but where he knew not,\u2014and he staggered back. Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up. \u201cClasp your arm tighter,\u201d said Sikes, as he drew him through the window. \u201cGive me a shawl here. They\u2019ve hit him. Quick! How the boy bleeds!\u201d Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy\u2019s heart; and he saw or heard no more. CHAPTER XXIII. WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS The night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air. Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. Many hunger worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world. Such was the aspect of out of doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,\u2014so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled. \u201cWell!\u201d said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; \u201cI\u2019m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!\u201d Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two ounce tin tea caddy, proceeded to make the tea. How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney\u2019s hand. \u201cDrat the pot!\u201d said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; \u201ca little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What use is it of, to anybody! Except,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, pausing, \u201cexcept to a poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!\u201d With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five and twenty years); and she was overpowered. \u201cI shall never get another!\u201d said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; \u201cI shall never get another\u2014like him.\u201d Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door. \u201cOh, come in with you!\u201d said Mrs. Corney, sharply. \u201cSome of the old women dying, I suppose. They always die when I\u2019m at meals. Don\u2019t stand there, letting the cold air in, don\u2019t. What\u2019s amiss now, eh?\u201d \u201cNothing, ma\u2019am, nothing,\u201d replied a man\u2019s voice. \u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, \u201cis that Mr. Bumble?\u201d \u201cAt your service, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other. \u201cShall I shut the door, ma\u2019am?\u201d The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors. Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission. \u201cHard weather, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the matron. \u201cHard, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the beadle. \u201cAnti porochial weather this, ma\u2019am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.\u201d \u201cOf course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?\u201d said the matron, sipping her tea. \u201cWhen, indeed, ma\u2019am!\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble. \u201cWhy here\u2019s one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful, ma\u2019am? Is he grateful? Not a copper farthing\u2019s worth of it! What does he do, ma\u2019am, but ask for a few coals; if it\u2019s only a pocket handkerchief full, he says! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his cheese with \u2019em and then come back for more. That\u2019s the way with these people, ma\u2019am; give \u2019em a apron full of coals today, and they\u2019ll come back for another, the day after tomorrow, as brazen as alabaster.\u201d The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on. \u201cI never,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201csee anything like the pitch it\u2019s got to. The day afore yesterday, a man\u2014you have been a married woman, ma\u2019am, and I may mention it to you\u2014a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer\u2019s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn\u2019t go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal. \u2018My heart!\u2019 says the ungrateful villain, \u2018what\u2019s the use of _this_ to me? You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!\u2019 \u2018Very good,\u2019 says our overseer, taking \u2019em away again, \u2018you won\u2019t get anything else here.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll die in the streets!\u2019 says the vagrant. \u2018Oh no, you won\u2019t,\u2019 says our overseer.\u201d \u201cHa! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d interposed the matron. \u201cWell, Mr. Bumble?\u201d \u201cWell, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined the beadle, \u201che went away; and he _did_ die in the streets. There\u2019s a obstinate pauper for you!\u201d \u201cIt beats anything I could have believed,\u201d observed the matron emphatically. \u201cBut don\u2019t you think out of door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr. Bumble? You\u2019re a gentleman of experience, and ought to know. Come.\u201d \u201cMrs. Corney,\u201d said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, \u201cout of door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma\u2019am: is the porochial safeguard. The great principle of out of door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don\u2019t want; and then they get tired of coming.\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Corney. \u201cWell, that is a good one, too!\u201d \u201cYes. Betwixt you and me, ma\u2019am,\u201d returned Mr. Bumble, \u201cthat\u2019s the great principle; and that\u2019s the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you\u2019ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese. That\u2019s the rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,\u201d said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, \u201cthese are official secrets, ma\u2019am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma\u2019am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!\u201d Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,\u201d said the matron. \u201cIt blows, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat collar, \u201cenough to cut one\u2019s ears off.\u201d The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her good night, bashfully inquired whether\u2014whether he wouldn\u2019t take a cup of tea? Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled. Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again Mr. Bumble coughed\u2014louder this time than he had coughed yet. \u201cSweet? Mr. Bumble?\u201d inquired the matron, taking up the sugar basin. \u201cVery sweet, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his eyes on Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was that beadle at that moment. The tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department. \u201cYou have a cat, ma\u2019am, I see,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; \u201cand kittens too, I declare!\u201d \u201cI am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can\u2019t think,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cThey\u2019re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.\u201d \u201cVery nice animals, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; \u201cso very domestic.\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u201d rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; \u201cso fond of their home too, that it\u2019s quite a pleasure, I\u2019m sure.\u201d \u201cMrs. Corney, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon, \u201cI mean to say this, ma\u2019am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma\u2019am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cOh, Mr. Bumble!\u201d remonstrated Mrs. Corney. \u201cIt\u2019s of no use disguising facts, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive; \u201cI would drown it myself, with pleasure.\u201d \u201cThen you\u2019re a cruel man,\u201d said the matron vivaciously, as she held out her hand for the beadle\u2019s cup; \u201cand a very hard hearted man besides.\u201d \u201cHard hearted, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cHard?\u201d Mr. Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney\u2019s little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire. It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr. Bumble\u2019s part: he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all. Whatever were Mr. Bumble\u2019s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated. Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped. Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr. Bumble\u2019s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea. \u201cHard hearted, Mrs. Corney?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and looking up into the matron\u2019s face; \u201care _you_ hard hearted, Mrs. Corney?\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, \u201cwhat a very curious question from a single man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?\u201d The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron. \u201cMr. Bumble!\u201d cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, \u201cMr. Bumble, I shall scream!\u201d Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron\u2019s waist. As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there. It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity. \u201cIf you please, mistress,\u201d said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly: putting her head in at the door, \u201cOld Sally is a going fast.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s that to me?\u201d angrily demanded the matron. \u201cI can\u2019t keep her alive, can I?\u201d \u201cNo, no, mistress,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cnobody can; she\u2019s far beyond the reach of help. I\u2019ve seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death\u2019s a coming, well enough. But she\u2019s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,\u2014and that\u2019s not often, for she is dying very hard,\u2014she says she has got something to tell, which you must hear. She\u2019ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.\u201d At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn\u2019t even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular should occur. Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way. Mr. Bumble\u2019s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable. He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar tongs, closely inspected a silver milk pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table. Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture. CHAPTER XXIV. TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT, BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron\u2019s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature\u2019s hand. Alas! How few of Nature\u2019s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven\u2019s surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin\u2019s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth. The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay. It was a bare garret room, with a dim light burning at the farther end. There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary\u2019s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill. \u201cCold night, Mrs. Corney,\u201d said this young gentleman, as the matron entered. \u201cVery cold, indeed, sir,\u201d replied the mistress, in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke. \u201cYou should get better coals out of your contractors,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; \u201cthese are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re the board\u2019s choosing, sir,\u201d returned the matron. \u201cThe least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.\u201d The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman. \u201cOh!\u201d said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, \u201cit\u2019s all U.P. there, Mrs. Corney.\u201d \u201cIt is, is it, sir?\u201d asked the matron. \u201cIf she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick\u2019s point. \u201cIt\u2019s a break up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old lady?\u201d The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative. \u201cThen perhaps she\u2019ll go off in that way, if you don\u2019t make a row,\u201d said the young man. \u201cPut the light on the floor. She won\u2019t see it there.\u201d The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned. The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed. The apothecary\u2019s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe. When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice. \u201cDid she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?\u201d inquired the messenger. \u201cNot a word,\u201d replied the other. \u201cShe plucked and tore at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She hasn\u2019t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain\u2019t so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!\u201d \u201cDid she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?\u201d demanded the first. \u201cI tried to get it down,\u201d rejoined the other. \u201cBut her teeth were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again. So _I_ drank it; and it did me good!\u201d Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily. \u201cI mind the time,\u201d said the first speaker, \u201cwhen she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.\u201d \u201cAy, that she would,\u201d rejoined the other; \u201cshe had a merry heart. A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork. My old eyes have seen them\u2014ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.\u201d Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old time discoloured tin snuff box, from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own. While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait? \u201cNot long, mistress,\u201d replied the second woman, looking up into her face. \u201cWe have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience! He\u2019ll be here soon enough for us all.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, you doting idiot!\u201d said the matron sternly. \u201cYou, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?\u201d \u201cOften,\u201d answered the first woman. \u201cBut will never be again,\u201d added the second one; \u201cthat is, she\u2019ll never wake again but once\u2014and mind, mistress, that won\u2019t be for long!\u201d \u201cLong or short,\u201d said the matron, snappishly, \u201cshe won\u2019t find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing. It\u2019s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I won\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans. If you make a fool of me again, I\u2019ll soon cure you, I warrant you!\u201d She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she cried, in a hollow voice. \u201cHush, hush!\u201d said one of the women, stooping over her. \u201cLie down, lie down!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never lie down again alive!\u201d said the woman, struggling. \u201cI _will_ tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.\u201d She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners. \u201cTurn them away,\u201d said the woman, drowsily; \u201cmake haste! make haste!\u201d The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin and water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves. \u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy. \u201cIn this very room\u2014in this very bed\u2014I once nursed a pretty young creetur\u2019, that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me think\u2014what was the year again!\u201d \u201cNever mind the year,\u201d said the impatient auditor; \u201cwhat about her?\u201d \u201cAy,\u201d murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state, \u201cwhat about her?\u2014what about\u2014I know!\u201d she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head\u2014\u201cI robbed her, so I did! She wasn\u2019t cold\u2014I tell you she wasn\u2019t cold, when I stole it!\u201d \u201cStole what, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d cried the matron, with a gesture as if she would call for help. \u201c_It_!\u201d replied the woman, laying her hand over the other\u2019s mouth. \u201cThe only thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!\u201d \u201cGold!\u201d echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back. \u201cGo on, go on\u2014yes\u2014what of it? Who was the mother? When was it?\u201d \u201cShe charged me to keep it safe,\u201d replied the woman with a groan, \u201cand trusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child\u2019s death, perhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they had known it all!\u201d \u201cKnown what?\u201d asked the other. \u201cSpeak!\u201d \u201cThe boy grew so like his mother,\u201d said the woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question, \u201cthat I could never forget it when I saw his face. Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb! Wait; there\u2019s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman. \u201cBe quick, or it may be too late!\u201d \u201cThe mother,\u201d said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; \u201cthe mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named. \u2018And oh, kind Heaven!\u2019 she said, folding her thin hands together, \u2018whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!\u2019\u201d \u201cThe boy\u2019s name?\u201d demanded the matron. \u201cThey _called_ him Oliver,\u201d replied the woman, feebly. \u201cThe gold I stole was\u2014\u201d \u201cYes, yes\u2014what?\u201d cried the other. She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed. \u201cStone dead!\u201d said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened. \u201cAnd nothing to tell, after all,\u201d rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away. The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body. CHAPTER XXV. WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in the old den\u2014the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl\u2014brooding over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars. At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling\u2019s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour\u2019s cards. It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin and water for the accommodation of the company. Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin and water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be \u201cblowed,\u201d or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days. \u201cThat\u2019s two doubles and the rub,\u201d said Mr. Chitling, with a very long face, as he drew half a crown from his waistcoat pocket. \u201cI never see such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we\u2019ve good cards, Charley and I can\u2019t make nothing of \u2019em.\u201d Either the matter or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter. \u201cMatter, Fagin!\u201d cried Charley. \u201cI wish you had watched the play. Tommy Chitling hasn\u2019t won a point; and I went partners with him against the Artful and dumb.\u201d \u201cAy, ay!\u201d said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason. \u201cTry \u2019em again, Tom; try \u2019em again.\u201d \u201cNo more of it for me, thank \u2019ee, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling; \u201cI\u2019ve had enough. That \u2019ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there\u2019s no standing again\u2019 him.\u201d \u201cHa! ha! my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cyou must get up very early in the morning, to win against the Dodger.\u201d \u201cMorning!\u201d said Charley Bates; \u201cyou must put your boots on over night, and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera glass between your shoulders, if you want to come over him.\u201d Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture card, at a shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness. \u201cHow precious dull you are, Tommy!\u201d said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019s thinking of, Fagin?\u201d \u201cHow should I know, my dear?\u201d replied the Jew, looking round as he plied the bellows. \u201cAbout his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he\u2019s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?\u201d \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. \u201cWhat do _you_ say, Charley?\u201d \u201c_I_ should say,\u201d replied Master Bates, with a grin, \u201cthat he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he\u2019s a blushing! Oh, my eye! here\u2019s a merry go rounder! Tommy Chitling\u2019s in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a spree!\u201d Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh. \u201cNever mind him, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows. \u201cBetsy\u2019s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.\u201d \u201cWhat I mean to say, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, \u201cis, that that isn\u2019t anything to anybody here.\u201d \u201cNo more it is,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cCharley will talk. Don\u2019t mind him, my dear; don\u2019t mind him. Betsy\u2019s a fine girl. Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.\u201d \u201cSo I _do_ do as she bids me,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling; \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been milled, if it hadn\u2019t been for her advice. But it turned out a good job for you; didn\u2019t it, Fagin! And what\u2019s six weeks of it? It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don\u2019t want to go out a walking so much; eh, Fagin?\u201d \u201cAh, to be sure, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind it again, Tom, would you,\u201d asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, \u201cif Bet was all right?\u201d \u201cI mean to say that I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Tom, angrily. \u201cThere, now. Ah! Who\u2019ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?\u201d \u201cNobody, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cnot a soul, Tom. I don\u2019t know one of \u2019em that would do it besides you; not one of \u2019em, my dear.\u201d \u201cI might have got clear off, if I\u2019d split upon her; mightn\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe. \u201cA word from me would have done it; wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d \u201cTo be sure it would, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t blab it; did I, Fagin?\u201d demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility. \u201cNo, no, to be sure,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cyou were too stout hearted for that. A deal too stout, my dear!\u201d \u201cPerhaps I was,\u201d rejoined Tom, looking round; \u201cand if I was, what\u2019s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?\u201d The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay. \u201cHark!\u201d cried the Dodger at this moment, \u201cI heard the tinkler.\u201d Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs. The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously. \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, \u201calone?\u201d The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just then. Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew\u2019s face, and awaited his directions. The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to know the worst. At length he raised his head. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d he asked. The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; \u201cbring him down. Hush! Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!\u201d This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit. \u201cHow are you, Faguey?\u201d said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. \u201cPop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that\u2019s the time of day! You\u2019ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.\u201d With these words he pulled up the smock frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob. \u201cSee there, Faguey,\u201d he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots; \u201cnot a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove! But don\u2019t look at me in that way, man. All in good time. I can\u2019t talk about business till I\u2019ve eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let\u2019s have a quiet fill out for the first time these three days!\u201d The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure. To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain. He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking. \u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said Toby. \u201cYes, yes!\u201d interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair. Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed. \u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said the housebreaker, \u201chow\u2019s Bill?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d screamed the Jew, starting from his seat. \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say\u2014\u201d began Toby, turning pale. \u201cMean!\u201d cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. \u201cWhere are they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?\u201d \u201cThe crack failed,\u201d said Toby faintly. \u201cI know it,\u201d replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it. \u201cWhat more?\u201d \u201cThey fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us\u2014straight as the crow flies\u2014through hedge and ditch. They gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.\u201d \u201cThe boy!\u201d \u201cBill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that\u2019s all I know about him.\u201d The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house. CHAPTER XXVI. IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit\u2019s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him back upon the pavement. Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely. Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick pockets. Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee shop, its beer shop, and its fried fish warehouse. It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back parlours, and who go as strangely as they come. Here, the clothesman, the shoe vamper, and the rag merchant, display their goods, as sign boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars. It was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child\u2019s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door. \u201cWhy, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!\u201d said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew\u2019s inquiry after his health. \u201cThe neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,\u201d said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,\u201d replied the trader; \u201cbut it soon cools down again; don\u2019t you find it so?\u201d Fagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight. \u201cAt the Cripples?\u201d inquired the man. The Jew nodded. \u201cLet me see,\u201d pursued the merchant, reflecting. \u201cYes, there\u2019s some half dozen of \u2019em gone in, that I knows. I don\u2019t think your friend\u2019s there.\u201d \u201cSikes is not, I suppose?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance. \u201c_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,\u201d replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. \u201cHave you got anything in my line tonight?\u201d \u201cNothing tonight,\u201d said the Jew, turning away. \u201cAre you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?\u201d cried the little man, calling after him. \u201cStop! I don\u2019t mind if I have a drop there with you!\u201d But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively\u2019s presence. By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour. The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured. Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person. The room was illuminated by two gas lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more. By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner. As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could. When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman\u2019s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause. It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said\u2014and sharp ones, too. Near him were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness. Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked: others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture. Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?\u201d inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing. \u201cWon\u2019t you join us? They\u2019ll be delighted, every one of \u2019em.\u201d The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, \u201cIs _he_ here?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the man. \u201cAnd no news of Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin. \u201cNone,\u201d replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. \u201cHe won\u2019t stir till it\u2019s all safe. Depend on it, they\u2019re on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he\u2019d blow upon the thing at once. He\u2019s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I\u2019ll pound it, that Barney\u2019s managing properly. Let him alone for that.\u201d \u201cWill _he_ be here tonight?\u201d asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before. \u201cMonks, do you mean?\u201d inquired the landlord, hesitating. \u201cHush!\u201d said the Jew. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCertain,\u201d replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; \u201cI expected him here before now. If you\u2019ll wait ten minutes, he\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his absence. \u201cTell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me tonight. No, say tomorrow. As he is not here, tomorrow will be time enough.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the man. \u201cNothing more?\u201d \u201cNot a word now,\u201d said the Jew, descending the stairs. \u201cI say,\u201d said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; \u201cwhat a time this would be for a sell! I\u2019ve got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!\u201d \u201cAh! But it\u2019s not Phil Barker\u2019s time,\u201d said the Jew, looking up. \u201cPhil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives\u2014_while they last_. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d The landlord reciprocated the old man\u2019s laugh; and returned to his guests. The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he called a hack cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes\u2019s residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot. \u201cNow,\u201d muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, \u201cif there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.\u201d She was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it. \u201cShe has been drinking,\u201d thought the Jew, cooly, \u201cor perhaps she is only miserable.\u201d The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit\u2019s story. When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word. She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all. During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned. Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone, \u201cAnd where should you think Bill was now, my dear?\u201d The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying. \u201cAnd the boy, too,\u201d said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face. \u201cPoor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!\u201d \u201cThe child,\u201d said the girl, suddenly looking up, \u201cis better where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, in amazement. \u201cAy, I do,\u201d returned the girl, meeting his gaze. \u201cI shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can\u2019t bear to have him about me. The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.\u201d \u201cPooh!\u201d said the Jew, scornfully. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d cried the girl bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s no fault of yours, if I am not! You\u2019d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;\u2014the humour doesn\u2019t suit you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d rejoined the Jew, furiously. \u201cIt does not.\u201d \u201cChange it, then!\u201d responded the girl, with a laugh. \u201cChange it!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion\u2019s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, \u201cI _will_ change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull\u2019s throat between my fingers now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!\u201d \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d cried the girl involuntarily. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d pursued Fagin, mad with rage. \u201cWhen the boy\u2019s worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to\u2014\u201d Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour. A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her. \u201cNancy, dear!\u201d croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. \u201cDid you mind me, dear?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry me now, Fagin!\u201d replied the girl, raising her head languidly. \u201cIf Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can\u2019t he won\u2019t; so no more about that.\u201d \u201cRegarding this boy, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together. \u201cThe boy must take his chance with the rest,\u201d interrupted Nancy, hastily; \u201cand I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm\u2019s way, and out of yours,\u2014that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got clear off, Bill\u2019s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill\u2019s worth two of Toby any time.\u201d \u201cAnd about what I was saying, my dear?\u201d observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her. \u201cYou must say it all over again, if it\u2019s anything you want me to do,\u201d rejoined Nancy; \u201cand if it is, you had better wait till tomorrow. You put me up for a minute; but now I\u2019m stupid again.\u201d Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed. Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew\u2019s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew\u2019s supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of \u201cNever say die!\u201d and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed. Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table. It was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way. He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived. \u201cFagin!\u201d whispered a voice close to his ear. \u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning quickly round, \u201cis that\u2014\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d interrupted the stranger. \u201cI have been lingering here these two hours. Where the devil have you been?\u201d \u201cOn your business, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. \u201cOn your business all night.\u201d \u201cOh, of course!\u201d said the stranger, with a sneer. \u201cWell; and what\u2019s come of it?\u201d \u201cNothing good,\u201d said the Jew. \u201cNothing bad, I hope?\u201d said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his companion. The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him. Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light. \u201cIt\u2019s as dark as the grave,\u201d said the man, groping forward a few steps. \u201cMake haste!\u201d \u201cShut the door,\u201d whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my doing,\u201d said the other man, feeling his way. \u201cThe wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.\u201d Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one. Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs. \u201cWe can say the few words we\u2019ve got to say in here, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; \u201cand as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we\u2019ll set the candle on the stairs. There!\u201d With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door. Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm chair opposite, they sat face to face. It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall. They conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation. They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks\u2014by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy\u2014said, raising his voice a little, \u201cI tell you again, it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?\u201d \u201cOnly hear him!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cWhy, do you mean to say you couldn\u2019t have done it, if you had chosen?\u201d demanded Monks, sternly. \u201cHaven\u2019t you done it, with other boys, scores of times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn\u2019t you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?\u201d \u201cWhose turn would that have served, my dear?\u201d inquired the Jew humbly. \u201cMine,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cBut not mine,\u201d said the Jew, submissively. \u201cHe might have become of use to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?\u201d \u201cWhat then?\u201d demanded Monks. \u201cI saw it was not easy to train him to the business,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201che was not like other boys in the same circumstances.\u201d \u201cCurse him, no!\u201d muttered the man, \u201cor he would have been a thief, long ago.\u201d \u201cI had no hold upon him to make him worse,\u201d pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his companion. \u201cHis hand was not in. I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.\u201d \u201c_That_ was not my doing,\u201d observed Monks. \u201cNo, no, my dear!\u201d renewed the Jew. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then _she_ begins to favour him.\u201d \u201cThrottle the girl!\u201d said Monks, impatiently. \u201cWhy, we can\u2019t afford to do that just now, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, smiling; \u201cand, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls are, Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she\u2019ll care no more for him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,\u2014\u201cit\u2019s not likely, mind,\u2014but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no fault of mine if he is!\u201d interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew\u2019s arm with trembling hands. \u201cMind that. Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the first. I won\u2019t shed blood; it\u2019s always found out, and haunts a man besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? Fire this infernal den! What\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet. \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cYonder!\u201d replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. \u201cThe shadow! I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!\u201d The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed. It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house. \u201cIt\u2019s your fancy,\u201d said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion. \u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw it!\u201d replied Monks, trembling. \u201cIt was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.\u201d The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death. \u201cWhat do you think now?\u201d said the Jew, when they had regained the passage. \u201cBesides ourselves, there\u2019s not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they\u2019re safe enough. See here!\u201d As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference. This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination. He declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o\u2019clock. And so the amiable couple parted. CHAPTER XXVII. ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words\u2014trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated\u2014hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies\u2019 beadles, or court of law beadles, or even chapel of ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim. Mr. Bumble had re counted the teaspoons, re weighed the sugar tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney\u2019s approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney\u2019s chest of drawers. Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving, in course of time, at the right hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest. He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath. \u201cMrs. Corney,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, \u201cwhat is this, ma\u2019am? Has anything happened, ma\u2019am? Pray answer me: I\u2019m on\u2014on\u2014\u201d Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word \u201ctenterhooks,\u201d so he said \u201cbroken bottles.\u201d \u201cOh, Mr. Bumble!\u201d cried the lady, \u201cI have been so dreadfully put out!\u201d \u201cPut out, ma\u2019am!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble; \u201cwho has dared to\u2014? I know!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, \u201cthis is them wicious paupers!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dreadful to think of!\u201d said the lady, shuddering. \u201cThen _don\u2019t_ think of it, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble. \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d whimpered the lady. \u201cThen take something, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble soothingly. \u201cA little of the wine?\u201d \u201cNot for the world!\u201d replied Mrs. Corney. \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u2014oh! The top shelf in the right hand corner\u2014oh!\u201d Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea cup with its contents, and held it to the lady\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m better now,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it. Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose. \u201cPeppermint,\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke. \u201cTry it! There\u2019s a little\u2014a little something else in it.\u201d Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty. \u201cIt\u2019s very comforting,\u201d said Mrs. Corney. \u201cVery much so indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney. \u201cI am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.\u201d \u201cNot weak, ma\u2019am,\u201d retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer. \u201cAre you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?\u201d \u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general principle. \u201cSo we are,\u201d said the beadle. Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney\u2019s chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney\u2019s apron string, round which it gradually became entwined. \u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. Mrs. Corney sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t sigh, Mrs. Corney,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again. \u201cThis is a very comfortable room, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble looking round. \u201cAnother room, and this, ma\u2019am, would be a complete thing.\u201d \u201cIt would be too much for one,\u201d murmured the lady. \u201cBut not for two, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. \u201cEh, Mrs. Corney?\u201d Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney\u2019s face. Mrs. Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe board allows you coals, don\u2019t they, Mrs. Corney?\u201d inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand. \u201cAnd candles,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure. \u201cCoals, candles, and house rent free,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cOh, Mrs. Corney, what an Angel you are!\u201d The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr. Bumble\u2019s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose. \u201cSuch porochial perfection!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. \u201cYou know that Mr. Slout is worse tonight, my fascinator?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully. \u201cHe can\u2019t live a week, the doctor says,\u201d pursued Mr. Bumble. \u201cHe is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens! What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!\u201d Mrs. Corney sobbed. \u201cThe little word?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty. \u201cThe one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?\u201d \u201cYe\u2014ye\u2014yes!\u201d sighed out the matron. \u201cOne more,\u201d pursued the beadle; \u201ccompose your darling feelings for only one more. When is it to come off?\u201d Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble\u2019s neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was \u201ca irresistible duck.\u201d Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady\u2019s spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble with the old woman\u2019s decease. \u201cVery good,\u201d said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; \u201cI\u2019ll call at Sowerberry\u2019s as I go home, and tell him to send tomorrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything particular, dear,\u201d said the lady evasively. \u201cIt must have been something, love,\u201d urged Mr. Bumble. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell your own B.?\u201d \u201cNot now,\u201d rejoined the lady; \u201cone of these days. After we\u2019re married, dear.\u201d \u201cAfter we\u2019re married!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t any impudence from any of them male paupers as\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, love!\u201d interposed the lady, hastily. \u201cIf I thought it was,\u201d continued Mr. Bumble; \u201cif I thought as any one of \u2019em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have dared to do it, love,\u201d responded the lady. \u201cThey had better not!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. \u201cLet me see any man, porochial or extra porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn\u2019t do it a second time!\u201d Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady\u2019s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove. The dove then turned up his coat collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers\u2019 ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker. Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting up. Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised. The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter pot and a wine bottle. At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman\u2019s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted. \u201cHere\u2019s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!\u201d said Charlotte; \u201ctry him, do; only this one.\u201d \u201cWhat a delicious thing is a oyster!\u201d remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it. \u201cWhat a pity it is, a number of \u2019em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn\u2019t it, Charlotte?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite a cruelty,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced Mr. Claypole. \u201cAn\u2019t yer fond of oysters?\u201d \u201cNot overmuch,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cI like to see you eat \u2019em, Noah dear, better than eating \u2019em myself.\u201d \u201cLor!\u201d said Noah, reflectively; \u201chow queer!\u201d \u201cHave another,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cHere\u2019s one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t manage any more,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry. Come here, Charlotte, and I\u2019ll kiss yer.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. \u201cSay that again, sir.\u201d Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr. Claypole, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror. \u201cSay it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cHow dare you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx? Kiss her!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation. \u201cFaugh!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it!\u201d said Noah, blubbering. \u201cShe\u2019s always a kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.\u201d \u201cOh, Noah,\u201d cried Charlotte, reproachfully. \u201cYer are; yer know yer are!\u201d retorted Noah. \u201cShe\u2019s always a doin\u2019 of it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. \u201cTake yourself downstairs, ma\u2019am. Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman\u2019s shell after breakfast tomorrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands. \u201cThe sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don\u2019t take their abominable courses under consideration, this country\u2019s ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!\u201d With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker\u2019s premises. And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman\u2019s funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him. CHAPTER XXVIII. LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES \u201cWolves tear your throats!\u201d muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. \u201cI wish I was among some of you; you\u2019d howl the hoarser for it.\u201d As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers. There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction. \u201cStop, you white livered hound!\u201d cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead. \u201cStop!\u201d The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand still. For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with. \u201cBear a hand with the boy,\u201d cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate. \u201cCome back!\u201d Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along. \u201cQuicker!\u201d cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket. \u201cDon\u2019t play booty with me.\u201d At this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them. \u201cIt\u2019s all up, Bill!\u201d cried Toby; \u201cdrop the kid, and show \u2019em your heels.\u201d With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone. \u201cHo, ho, there!\u201d cried a tremulous voice in the rear. \u201cPincher! Neptune! Come here, come here!\u201d The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together. \u201cMy advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,\u201d said the fattest man of the party, \u201cthat we \u2019mediately go home again.\u201d \u201cI am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,\u201d said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t wish to appear ill mannered, gentlemen,\u201d said the third, who had called the dogs back, \u201cMr. Giles ought to know.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d replied the shorter man; \u201cand whatever Mr. Giles says, it isn\u2019t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.\u201d To tell the truth, the little man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke. \u201cYou are afraid, Brittles,\u201d said Mr. Giles. \u201cI an\u2019t,\u201d said Brittles. \u201cYou are,\u201d said Giles. \u201cYou\u2019re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,\u201d said Brittles. \u201cYou\u2019re a lie, Brittles,\u201d said Mr. Giles. Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles\u2019s taunt; and Mr. Giles\u2019s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cwe\u2019re all afraid.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the party. \u201cSo I do,\u201d replied the man. \u201cIt\u2019s natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances. I am.\u201d \u201cSo am I,\u201d said Brittles; \u201conly there\u2019s no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.\u201d These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he_ was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech. \u201cBut it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, \u201cwhat a man will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed murder\u2014I know I should\u2014if we\u2019d caught one of them rascals.\u201d As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament. \u201cI know what it was,\u201d said Mr. Giles; \u201cit was the gate.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder if it was,\u201d exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea. \u201cYou may depend upon it,\u201d said Giles, \u201cthat that gate stopped the flow of the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.\u201d By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance. This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit. Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty. Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire. Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne. The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him. Morning drew on apace. The air became more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue\u2014the death of night, rather than the birth of day\u2014glimmered faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay. At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood. He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground. After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man. But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither. And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing\u2014for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber\u2019s grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly. Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road. Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him. He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it. As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him. That garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men\u2019s mercy. It was the very house they had attempted to rob. Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly? He pushed against the garden gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges. He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico. It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr. Giles\u2019s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society. But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his hearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest. \u201cIt was about half past two,\u201d said Mr. Giles, \u201cor I wouldn\u2019t swear that it mightn\u2019t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bed clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.\u201d At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear. \u201c\u2014Heerd a noise,\u201d continued Mr. Giles. \u201cI says, at first, \u2018This is illusion\u2019; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of a noise?\u201d asked the cook. \u201cA kind of a busting noise,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, looking round him. \u201cMore like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater,\u201d suggested Brittles. \u201cIt was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,\u201d rejoined Mr. Giles; \u201cbut, at this time, it had a busting sound. I turned down the clothes\u201d; continued Giles, rolling back the table cloth, \u201csat up in bed; and listened.\u201d The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated \u201cLor!\u201d and drew their chairs closer together. \u201cI heerd it now, quite apparent,\u201d resumed Mr. Giles. \u201c\u2018Somebody,\u2019 I says, \u2018is forcing of a door, or window; what\u2019s to be done? I\u2019ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,\u2019 I says, \u2018may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.\u2019\u201d Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror. \u201cI tossed off the clothes,\u201d said Giles, throwing away the table cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, \u201cgot softly out of bed; drew on a pair of\u2014\u201d \u201cLadies present, Mr. Giles,\u201d murmured the tinker. \u201c\u2014Of _shoes_, sir,\u201d said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; \u201cseized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room. \u2018Brittles,\u2019 I says, when I had woke him, \u2018don\u2019t be frightened!\u2019\u201d \u201cSo you did,\u201d observed Brittles, in a low voice. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re dead men, I think, Brittles,\u2019 I says,\u201d continued Giles; \u201c\u2018but don\u2019t be frightened.\u2019\u201d \u201c_Was_ he frightened?\u201d asked the cook. \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr. Giles. \u201cHe was as firm\u2014ah! pretty near as firm as I was.\u201d \u201cI should have died at once, I\u2019m sure, if it had been me,\u201d observed the housemaid. \u201cYou\u2019re a woman,\u201d retorted Brittles, plucking up a little. \u201cBrittles is right,\u201d said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; \u201cfrom a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle\u2019s hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,\u2014as it might be so.\u201d Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair. The cook and housemaid screamed. \u201cIt was a knock,\u201d said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. \u201cOpen the door, somebody.\u201d Nobody moved. \u201cIt seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,\u201d said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; \u201cbut the door must be opened. Do you hear, somebody?\u201d Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep. The women were out of the question. \u201cIf Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,\u201d said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, \u201cI am ready to make one.\u201d \u201cSo am I,\u201d said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep. Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. By the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs\u2019 tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely. These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the tinker\u2019s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other\u2019s shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion. \u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the\u2014eh?\u2014Why\u2014Brittles\u2014look here\u2014don\u2019t you know?\u201d Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof. \u201cHere he is!\u201d bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; \u201chere\u2019s one of the thieves, ma\u2019am! Here\u2019s a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.\u201d \u201c\u2014In a lantern, miss,\u201d cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better. The two women servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr. Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged. In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant. \u201cGiles!\u201d whispered the voice from the stair head. \u201cI\u2019m here, miss,\u201d replied Mr. Giles. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, miss; I ain\u2019t much injured. He didn\u2019t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I was soon too many for him.\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d replied the young lady; \u201cyou frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?\u201d \u201cWounded desperate, miss,\u201d replied Giles, with indescribable complacency. \u201cHe looks as if he was a going, miss,\u201d bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?\u201d \u201cHush, pray; there\u2019s a good man!\u201d rejoined the lady. \u201cWait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.\u201d With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away. She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles\u2019s room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor. \u201cBut won\u2019t you take one look at him, first, miss?\u201d asked Mr. Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down. \u201cNot one little peep, miss?\u201d \u201cNot now, for the world,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cPoor fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!\u201d The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman. CHAPTER XXIX. HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well spread breakfast table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station some half way between the side board and the breakfast table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance. Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her. Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion. The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God\u2019s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers. She was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness. She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her. \u201cAnd Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\u201d asked the old lady, after a pause. \u201cAn hour and twelve minutes, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon. \u201cHe is always slow,\u201d remarked the old lady. \u201cBrittles always was a slow boy, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the attendant. And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one. \u201cHe gets worse instead of better, I think,\u201d said the elder lady. \u201cIt is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,\u201d said the young lady, smiling. Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast table together. \u201cI never heard of such a thing!\u201d exclaimed the fat gentleman. \u201cMy dear Mrs. Maylie\u2014bless my soul\u2014in the silence of the night, too\u2014I _never_ heard of such a thing!\u201d With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves. \u201cYou ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\u201d said the fat gentleman. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I\u2019m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!\u201d The doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous. \u201cAnd you, Miss Rose,\u201d said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \u201cI\u2014\u201d \u201cOh! very much so, indeed,\u201d said Rose, interrupting him; \u201cbut there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\u201d \u201cAh! to be sure,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cso there is. That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.\u201d Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour. \u201cHonour, eh?\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know; perhaps it\u2019s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\u2019ve fought a duel, Giles.\u201d Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party. \u201cGad, that\u2019s true!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWhere is he? Show me the way. I\u2019ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That\u2019s the little window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn\u2019t have believed it!\u201d Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as \u201cthe doctor,\u201d had grown fat, more from good humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive. The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully. \u201cThis is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,\u201d said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut. \u201cHe is not in danger, I hope?\u201d said the old lady. \u201cWhy, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cthough I don\u2019t think he is. Have you seen the thief?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the old lady. \u201cNor heard anything about him?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Mr. Giles; \u201cbut I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\u201d The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage. \u201cRose wished to see the man,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d \u201cHumph!\u201d rejoined the doctor. \u201cThere is nothing very alarming in his appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\u201d \u201cIf it be necessary,\u201d replied the old lady, \u201ccertainly not.\u201d \u201cThen I think it is necessary,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cat all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me\u2014Miss Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!\u201d CHAPTER XXX. RELATES WHAT OLIVER\u2019S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\u2019s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs. \u201cNow,\u201d said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom door, \u201clet us hear what you think of him. He has not been shaved very recently, but he don\u2019t look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting order.\u201d Stepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow. The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver\u2019s hair from his face. As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead. The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall. \u201cWhat can this mean?\u201d exclaimed the elder lady. \u201cThis poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!\u201d \u201cVice,\u201d said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \u201ctakes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shall not enshrine her?\u201d \u201cBut at so early an age!\u201d urged Rose. \u201cMy dear young lady,\u201d rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; \u201ccrime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone. The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\u201d \u201cBut, can you\u2014oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\u201d said Rose. The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment. \u201cBut even if he has been wicked,\u201d pursued Rose, \u201cthink how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother\u2019s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy\u2019s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!\u201d \u201cMy dear love,\u201d said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, \u201cdo you think I would harm a hair of his head?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Rose, eagerly. \u201cNo, surely,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cmy days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?\u201d \u201cLet me think, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the doctor; \u201clet me think.\u201d Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of \u201cI\u2019ve got it now\u201d and \u201cno, I haven\u2019t,\u201d and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows: \u201cI think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don\u2019t object to that?\u201d \u201cUnless there is some other way of preserving the child,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie. \u201cThere is no other,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNo other, take my word for it.\u201d \u201cThen my aunt invests you with full power,\u201d said Rose, smiling through her tears; \u201cbut pray don\u2019t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.\u201d \u201cYou seem to think,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cthat everybody is disposed to be hard hearted today, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.\u201d \u201cYou are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\u201d returned Rose, blushing. \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, laughing heartily, \u201cthat is no very difficult matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn\u2019t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation\u2014that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.\u201d \u201cOh no, aunt!\u201d entreated Rose. \u201cOh yes, aunt!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d \u201cHe cannot be hardened in vice,\u201d said Rose; \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d retorted the doctor; \u201cthen so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.\u201d Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake. The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the kind hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done. The conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men\u2019s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\u2019s life brings with it! Oliver\u2019s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur. The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr. Giles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went. There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable. The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale\u2014as indeed he had. The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it. \u201cSit still!\u201d said the doctor, waving his hand. \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles. \u201cMisses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \u2019em here.\u201d Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles\u2019s condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them. \u201cHow is the patient tonight, sir?\u201d asked Giles. \u201cSo so\u201d; returned the doctor. \u201cI am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. Giles.\u201d \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mean to say, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, trembling, \u201cthat he\u2019s going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn\u2019t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d said the doctor, mysteriously. \u201cMr. Giles, are you a Protestant?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, I hope so,\u201d faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale. \u201cAnd what are _you_, boy?\u201d said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles. \u201cLord bless me, sir!\u201d replied Brittles, starting violently; \u201cI\u2019m the same as Mr. Giles, sir.\u201d \u201cThen tell me this,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cboth of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We are prepared for you!\u201d The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction. \u201cPay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\u201d said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\u2019s utmost acuteness. \u201cSomething may come of this before long.\u201d The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney corner. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is, sir,\u201d replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way. \u201cHere\u2019s the house broken into,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand a couple of men catch one moment\u2019s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here\u2019s a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him\u2014by doing which, they place his life in great danger\u2014and swear he is the thief. Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?\u201d The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn\u2019t law, he would be glad to know what was. \u201cI ask you again,\u201d thundered the doctor, \u201care you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?\u201d Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels. \u201cIt\u2019s the runners!\u201d cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved. \u201cThe what?\u201d exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn. \u201cThe Bow Street officers, sir,\u201d replied Brittles, taking up a candle; \u201cme and Mr. Giles sent for \u2019em this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cYes,\u201d replied Brittles; \u201cI sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren\u2019t here before, sir.\u201d \u201cYou did, did you? Then confound your\u2014slow coaches down here; that\u2019s all,\u201d said the doctor, walking away. CHAPTER XXXI. INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand. \u201cOpen the door,\u201d replied a man outside; \u201cit\u2019s the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to today.\u201d Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there. \u201cJust send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\u201d said the officer; \u201che\u2019s in the gig, a minding the prad. Have you got a coach \u2019us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\u201d Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great coats and hats, and showed like what they were. The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a red headed, bony man, in top boots; with a rather ill favoured countenance, and a turned up sinister looking nose. \u201cTell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\u201d said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table. \u201cOh! Good evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?\u201d This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door. \u201cThis is the lady of the house,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie. Mr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it\u2014one of the two\u2014seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment. \u201cNow, with regard to this here robbery, master,\u201d said Blathers. \u201cWhat are the circumstances?\u201d Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod. \u201cI can\u2019t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\u201d said Blathers; \u201cbut my opinion at once is,\u2014I don\u2019t mind committing myself to that extent,\u2014that this wasn\u2019t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied Duff. \u201cAnd, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?\u201d said Mr. Losberne, with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s it, master,\u201d replied Blathers. \u201cThis is all about the robbery, is it?\u201d \u201cAll,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cNow, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a talking on?\u201d said Blathers. \u201cNothing at all,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cOne of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it\u2019s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\u201d \u201cWery easy disposed of, if it is,\u201d remarked Duff. \u201cWhat he says is quite correct,\u201d observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets. \u201cWho is the boy? What account does he give of himself? Where did he come from? He didn\u2019t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies. \u201cI know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently. You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d rejoined Mr. Blathers. \u201cWe had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That\u2019s the usual way of doing business.\u201d Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night\u2019s adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child\u2019s play. Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces. \u201cUpon my word,\u201d he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, \u201cI hardly know what to do.\u201d \u201cSurely,\u201d said Rose, \u201cthe poor child\u2019s story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\u201d \u201cI doubt it, my dear young lady,\u201d said the doctor, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say? A runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.\u201d \u201cYou believe it, surely?\u201d interrupted Rose. \u201c_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,\u201d rejoined the doctor; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer, nevertheless.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d demanded Rose. \u201cBecause, my pretty cross examiner,\u201d replied the doctor: \u201cbecause, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\u2019s pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\u2019s house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\u2019t you see all this?\u201d \u201cI see it, of course,\u201d replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\u2019s impetuosity; \u201cbut still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cof course not! Bless the bright eyes of your sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.\u201d Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before. \u201cThe more I think of it,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthe more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy\u2019s real story. I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.\u201d \u201cOh! what is to be done?\u201d cried Rose. \u201cDear, dear! why did they send for these people?\u201d \u201cWhy, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. \u201cI would not have had them here, for the world.\u201d \u201cAll I know is,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, \u201cthat we must try and carry it off with a bold face. The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that\u2019s one comfort. We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!\u201d \u201cWell, master,\u201d said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. \u201cThis warn\u2019t a put up thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what the devil\u2019s a put up thing?\u201d demanded the doctor, impatiently. \u201cWe call it a put up robbery, ladies,\u201d said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\u2019s, \u201cwhen the servants is in it.\u201d \u201cNobody suspected them, in this case,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie. \u201cWery likely not, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Blathers; \u201cbut they might have been in it, for all that.\u201d \u201cMore likely on that wery account,\u201d said Duff. \u201cWe find it was a town hand,\u201d said Blathers, continuing his report; \u201cfor the style of work is first rate.\u201d \u201cWery pretty indeed it is,\u201d remarked Duff, in an undertone. \u201cThere was two of \u2019em in it,\u201d continued Blathers; \u201cand they had a boy with \u2019em; that\u2019s plain from the size of the window. That\u2019s all to be said at present. We\u2019ll see this lad that you\u2019ve got upstairs at once, if you please.\u201d \u201cPerhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?\u201d said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him. \u201cOh! to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Rose, eagerly. \u201cYou shall have it immediately, if you will.\u201d \u201cWhy, thank you, miss!\u201d said Blathers, drawing his coat sleeve across his mouth; \u201cit\u2019s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that\u2019s handy, miss; don\u2019t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\u201d \u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard. \u201cA little drop of spirits, master, if it\u2019s all the same,\u201d replied Blathers. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold ride from London, ma\u2019am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\u201d This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room. \u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; \u201cI have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.\u201d \u201cThat crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\u201d said Mr. Duff, assisting his colleague\u2019s memory. \u201cThat was something in this way, warn\u2019t it?\u201d rejoined Mr. Blathers; \u201cthat was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\u201d \u201cYou always gave that to him\u201d replied Duff. \u201cIt was the Family Pet, I tell you. Conkey hadn\u2019t any more to do with it than I had.\u201d \u201cGet out!\u201d retorted Mr. Blathers; \u201cI know better. Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was! Better than any novel book _I_ ever see!\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good humour in the unwelcome visitors. \u201cIt was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,\u201d said Blathers. \u201cThis here Conkey Chickweed\u2014\u201d \u201cConkey means Nosey, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Duff. \u201cOf course the lady knows that, don\u2019t she?\u201d demanded Mr. Blathers. \u201cAlways interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting, and badger drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I\u2019ve seen \u2019em off\u2019en. He warn\u2019t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a hue and cry, directly, and when they came to look about \u2019em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \u2019em. However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\u2019t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house. \u2018I see him, Spyers,\u2019 said Chickweed, \u2018pass my house yesterday morning,\u2019 \u2018Why didn\u2019t you up, and collar him!\u2019 says Spyers. \u2018I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\u2019 says the poor man; \u2018but we\u2019re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at night he passed again.\u2019 Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\u2019s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, \u2018Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\u2019 Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a tearing down the street full cry. Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, \u2018Thieves!\u2019 and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \u2018Which is the man?\u2019 \u2018D\u2014me!\u2019 says Chickweed, \u2018I\u2019ve lost him again!\u2019 It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn\u2019t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn\u2019t help shutting \u2019em, to ease \u2019em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a roaring out, \u2018Here he is!\u2019 Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday\u2019s one, the man\u2019s lost again! This was done, once or twice more, till one half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.\u201d \u201cWhat did Jem Spyers say?\u201d inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story. \u201cJem Spyers,\u201d resumed the officer, \u201cfor a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says \u2018Chickweed, I\u2019ve found out who done this here robbery.\u2019 \u2018Have you?\u2019 said Chickweed. \u2018Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!\u2019 \u2018Come!\u2019 said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, \u2018none of that gammon! You did it yourself.\u2019 So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn\u2019t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!\u201d said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine glass, and clinking the handcuffs together. \u201cVery curious, indeed,\u201d observed the doctor. \u201cNow, if you please, you can walk upstairs.\u201d \u201cIf _you_ please, sir,\u201d returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr. Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\u2019s bedroom; Mr. Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle. Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward\u2014in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing. \u201cThis,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, \u201cthis is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What d\u2019 ye call him\u2019s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\u201d Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to deny that, I suppose?\u201d said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again. \u201cIt was all done for the\u2014for the best, sir,\u201d answered Giles. \u201cI am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\u2019t have meddled with him. I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.\u201d \u201cThought it was what boy?\u201d inquired the senior officer. \u201cThe housebreaker\u2019s boy, sir!\u201d replied Giles. \u201cThey\u2014they certainly had a boy.\u201d \u201cWell? Do you think so now?\u201d inquired Blathers. \u201cThink what, now?\u201d replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner. \u201cThink it\u2019s the same boy, Stupid head?\u201d rejoined Blathers, impatiently. \u201cI don\u2019t know; I really don\u2019t know,\u201d said Giles, with a rueful countenance. \u201cI couldn\u2019t swear to him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Mr. Blathers. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d replied poor Giles. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is the boy; indeed, I\u2019m almost certain that it isn\u2019t. You know it can\u2019t be.\u201d \u201cHas this man been a drinking, sir?\u201d inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor. \u201cWhat a precious muddle headed chap you are!\u201d said Duff, addressing Mr. Giles, with supreme contempt. Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient\u2019s pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them. Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn\u2019t know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty. Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning. With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\u2019s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went. In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver\u2019s appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed. Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven\u2014and if they be not, what prayers are!\u2014the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness. CHAPTER XXXII. OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS Oliver\u2019s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul. \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; \u201cyou shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.\u201d \u201cThe trouble!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cOh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!\u201d \u201cYou shall give nothing at all,\u201d said Miss Maylie, smiling; \u201cfor, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.\u201d \u201cHappy, ma\u2019am!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201chow kind of you to say so!\u201d \u201cYou will make me happier than I can tell you,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cTo think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand me?\u201d she inquired, watching Oliver\u2019s thoughtful face. \u201cOh yes, ma\u2019am, yes!\u201d replied Oliver eagerly; \u201cbut I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.\u201d \u201cTo whom?\u201d inquired the young lady. \u201cTo the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,\u201d rejoined Oliver. \u201cIf they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.\u201d \u201cI am sure they would,\u201d rejoined Oliver\u2019s benefactress; \u201cand Mr. Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.\u201d \u201cHas he, ma\u2019am?\u201d cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!\u201d In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the boy?\u201d cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle. \u201cDo you see anything\u2014hear anything\u2014feel anything\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cThat, sir,\u201d cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. \u201cThat house!\u201d \u201cYes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cWhat of the house, my man; eh?\u201d \u201cThe thieves\u2014the house they took me to!\u201d whispered Oliver. \u201cThe devil it is!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cHallo, there! let me out!\u201d But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman. \u201cHalloa?\u201d said a little ugly hump backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here?\u201d \u201cMatter!\u201d exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment\u2019s reflection. \u201cA good deal. Robbery is the matter.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019ll be Murder the matter, too,\u201d replied the hump backed man, coolly, \u201cif you don\u2019t take your hands off. Do you hear me?\u201d \u201cI hear you,\u201d said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake. \u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014confound the fellow, what\u2019s his rascally name\u2014Sikes; that\u2019s it. Where\u2019s Sikes, you thief?\u201d The hump backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor\u2019s grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house. Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley. He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver\u2019s description! \u201cNow!\u201d said the hump backed man, who had watched him keenly, \u201cwhat do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?\u201d \u201cDid you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?\u201d said the irritable doctor. \u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d demanded the hunchback. \u201cWill you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!\u201d \u201cAs soon as I think proper,\u201d said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver\u2019s account of it. \u201cI shall find you out, some day, my friend.\u201d \u201cWill you?\u201d sneered the ill favoured cripple. \u201cIf you ever want me, I\u2019m here. I haven\u2019t lived here mad and all alone, for five and twenty years, to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.\u201d And so saying, the mis shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage. \u201cStupid enough, this,\u201d muttered the doctor to himself; \u201cthe boy must have made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.\u201d With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage. The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards. He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage. \u201cI am an ass!\u201d said the doctor, after a long silence. \u201cDid you know that before, Oliver?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cThen don\u2019t forget it another time.\u201d \u201cAn ass,\u201d said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes. \u201cEven if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single handed? And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though. I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse. It might have done me good.\u201d Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him. If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver\u2019s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any. He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver\u2019s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth. As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath. \u201cNow, my boy, which house is it?\u201d inquired Mr. Losberne. \u201cThat! That!\u201d replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. \u201cThe white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.\u201d \u201cCome, come!\u201d said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cYou will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.\u201d \u201cOh! I hope so!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cThey were so good to me; so very, very good to me.\u201d The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face. Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. \u201cTo Let.\u201d \u201cKnock at the next door,\u201d cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver\u2019s arm in his. \u201cWhat has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?\u201d The servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward. \u201cHas his housekeeper gone too?\u201d inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment\u2019s pause. \u201cYes, sir\u201d; replied the servant. \u201cThe old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow\u2019s, all went together.\u201d \u201cThen turn towards home again,\u201d said Mr. Losberne to the driver; \u201cand don\u2019t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!\u201d \u201cThe book stall keeper, sir?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cI know the way there. See him, pray, sir! Do see him!\u201d \u201cMy poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cQuite enough for both of us. If we go to the book stall keeper\u2019s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away. No; home again straight!\u201d And in obedience to the doctor\u2019s impulse, home they went. This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber\u2014a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day\u2014was almost more than he could bear. The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months. Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin\u2019s cupidity, to the banker\u2019s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them. Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature\u2019s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it. It was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there. The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours. Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest. Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain. It was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts. Every morning he went to a white headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him. Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture. And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver\u2019s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before. Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself. In the morning, Oliver would be a foot by six o\u2019clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast table. There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie\u2019s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good will, until Miss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done. So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver\u2019s were true felicity. With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself. CHAPTER XXXIII. WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness. The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond. The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad. It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing. Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people. He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him. One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing. Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds. Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual. After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping. \u201cRose, my dear!\u201d said the elder lady. Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts. \u201cRose, my love!\u201d cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her. \u201cWhat is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?\u201d \u201cNothing, aunt; nothing,\u201d replied the young lady. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is; I can\u2019t describe it; but I feel\u2014\u201d \u201cNot ill, my love?\u201d interposed Mrs. Maylie. \u201cNo, no! Oh, not ill!\u201d replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; \u201cI shall be better presently. Close the window, pray!\u201d Oliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress. \u201cMy child!\u201d said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, \u201cI never saw you so before.\u201d \u201cI would not alarm you if I could avoid it,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cbut indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.\u201d She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before. Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye. Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale. Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well. \u201cI hope,\u201d said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, \u201cthat nothing is the matter? She don\u2019t look well tonight, but\u2014\u201d The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she said, in a trembling voice: \u201cI hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Oliver. \u201cThe heavy blow,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cof losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.\u201d \u201cOh! God forbid!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, hastily. \u201cAmen to that, my child!\u201d said the old lady, wringing her hands. \u201cSurely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?\u201d said Oliver. \u201cTwo hours ago, she was quite well.\u201d \u201cShe is very ill now,\u201d rejoined Mrs. Maylie; \u201cand will be worse, I am sure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!\u201d She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm. \u201cAnd consider, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. \u201cOh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her. I am sure\u2014certain\u2014quite certain\u2014that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so young.\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver\u2019s head. \u201cYou think like a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. God\u2019s will be done! I love her; and He knows how well!\u201d Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully. But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances. How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves? An anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie\u2019s predictions were but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever. \u201cWe must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; \u201cthis letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr. Losberne. It must be carried to the market town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.\u201d Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once. \u201cHere is another letter,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; \u201cbut whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.\u201d \u201cIs it for Chertsey, too, ma\u2019am?\u201d inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter. \u201cNo,\u201d replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord\u2019s house in the country; where, he could not make out. \u201cShall it go, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently. \u201cI think not,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. \u201cI will wait until tomorrow.\u201d With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster. Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market place of the market town. Here he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of \u201cThe George.\u201d To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye. He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick. This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage. At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike road, in a couple of minutes. As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn yard, with a somewhat lighter heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door. \u201cHah!\u201d cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling. \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver; \u201cI was in a great hurry to get home, and didn\u2019t see you were coming.\u201d \u201cDeath!\u201d muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes. \u201cWho would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He\u2019d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!\u201d \u201cI am sorry,\u201d stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man\u2019s wild look. \u201cI hope I have not hurt you!\u201d \u201cRot you!\u201d murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth; \u201cif I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?\u201d The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit. Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted. The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory. Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid night she was delirious. A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.\u201d How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave\u2019s verge! Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them! Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside. Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived. \u201cIt is hard,\u201d said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; \u201cso young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.\u201d Another morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence. There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds. A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts. Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother\u2014a mother once\u2014among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on. Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He had no cause for self reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been. We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done\u2014of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time. When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour. Oliver\u2019s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away. He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die. They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure. Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep. They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered. \u201cWhat of Rose?\u201d cried the old lady. \u201cTell me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!\u201d \u201cYou must compose yourself,\u201d said the doctor supporting her. \u201cBe calm, my dear ma\u2019am, pray.\u201d \u201cLet me go, in God\u2019s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d cried the doctor, passionately. \u201cAs He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.\u201d The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her. CHAPTER XXXIV. CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER It was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast. The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber. As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking round, he saw that it was a post chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him. As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person. In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses. Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name. \u201cHere!\u201d cried the voice. \u201cOliver, what\u2019s the news? Miss Rose! Master O li ver!\u201d \u201cIs it you, Giles?\u201d cried Oliver, running up to the chaise door. Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news. \u201cIn a word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cBetter or worse?\u201d \u201cBetter\u2014much better!\u201d replied Oliver, hastily. \u201cThank Heaven!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d \u201cQuite, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cThe change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.\u201d The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside. \u201cYou are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?\u201d demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. \u201cDo not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.\u201d \u201cI would not for the world, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cIndeed you may believe me. Mr. Losberne\u2019s words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come. I heard him say so.\u201d The tears stood in Oliver\u2019s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark\u2014for he could well guess what his feelings were\u2014and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay. All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket handkerchief dotted with white spots. That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him. \u201cI think you had better go on to my mother\u2019s in the chaise, Giles,\u201d said he. \u201cI would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her. You can say I am coming.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,\u201d said Giles: giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; \u201cbut if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It wouldn\u2019t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, \u201cyou can do as you like. Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.\u201d Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure. As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about five and twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother. Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides. \u201cMother!\u201d whispered the young man; \u201cwhy did you not write before?\u201d \u201cI did,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie; \u201cbut, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne\u2019s opinion.\u201d \u201cBut why,\u201d said the young man, \u201cwhy run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If Rose had\u2014I cannot utter that word now\u2014if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!\u201d \u201cIf that _had_ been the case, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cI fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.\u201d \u201cAnd who can wonder if it be so, mother?\u201d rejoined the young man; \u201cor why should I say, _if?_\u2014It is\u2014it is\u2014you know it, mother\u2014you must know it!\u201d \u201cI know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie; \u201cI know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting. If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.\u201d \u201cThis is unkind, mother,\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?\u201d \u201cI think, my dear son,\u201d returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, \u201cthat youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting. Above all, I think\u201d said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son\u2019s face, \u201cthat if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d said the young man, impatiently, \u201che would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.\u201d \u201cYou think so now, Harry,\u201d replied his mother. \u201cAnd ever will!\u201d said the young man. \u201cThe mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind. Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.\u201d \u201cHarry,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cit is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.\u201d \u201cLet it rest with Rose, then,\u201d interposed Harry. \u201cYou will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d rejoined Mrs. Maylie; \u201cbut I would have you consider\u2014\u201d \u201cI _have_ considered!\u201d was the impatient reply; \u201cMother, I have considered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.\u201d \u201cShe shall,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie. \u201cThere is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,\u201d said the young man. \u201cNot coldly,\u201d rejoined the old lady; \u201cfar from it.\u201d \u201cHow then?\u201d urged the young man. \u201cShe has formed no other attachment?\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d replied his mother; \u201cyou have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already. What I would say,\u201d resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, \u201cis this. Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose\u2019s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cThat I leave you to discover,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie. \u201cI must go back to her. God bless you!\u201d \u201cI shall see you again tonight?\u201d said the young man, eagerly. \u201cBy and by,\u201d replied the lady; \u201cwhen I leave Rose.\u201d \u201cYou will tell her I am here?\u201d said Harry. \u201cOf course,\u201d replied Mrs. Maylie. \u201cAnd say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her. You will not refuse to do this, mother?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI will tell her all.\u201d And pressing her son\u2019s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room. Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them. The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient\u2019s situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver\u2019s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears. \u201cHave you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?\u201d inquired the doctor, when he had concluded. \u201cNothing particular, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes. \u201cNor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house breakers?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNone at all, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity. \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cI am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?\u201d \u201cThe boy is very well, sir,\u201d said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone of patronage; \u201cand sends his respectful duty, sir.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cSeeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will you?\u201d Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings bank, the sum of five and twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit. At this, the two women servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt frill, replied, \u201cNo, no\u201d; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so. And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are. Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman\u2019s good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need. Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days. The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects. Men who look on nature, and their fellow men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision. It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed. The window of the young lady\u2019s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning\u2019s walk. Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering. Nor did Oliver\u2019s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself. It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence. The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground floor, at the back of the house. It was quite a cottage room, with a lattice window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a wicket gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow land and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive. One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books. He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep. There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two. Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state. It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness. Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew\u2019s house again. There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him. \u201cHush, my dear!\u201d he thought he heard the Jew say; \u201cit is he, sure enough. Come away.\u201d \u201cHe!\u201d the other man seemed to answer; \u201ccould I mistake him, think you? If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn\u2019t a mark above it, that he lay buried there?\u201d The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up. Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There\u2014there\u2014at the window\u2014close before him\u2014so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn yard. It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone. But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help. CHAPTER XXXV. CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER\u2019S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver\u2019s cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, \u201cThe Jew! the Jew!\u201d Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver\u2019s history from his mother, understood it at once. \u201cWhat direction did he take?\u201d he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner. \u201cThat,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; \u201cI missed them in an instant.\u201d \u201cThen, they are in the ditch!\u201d said Harry. \u201cFollow! And keep as near me, as you can.\u201d So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him. Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter. On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit. The search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles. There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the meadow land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason. \u201cIt must have been a dream, Oliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie. \u201cOh no, indeed, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch\u2019s countenance; \u201cI saw him too plainly for that. I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.\u201d \u201cWho was the other?\u201d inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together. \u201cThe very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cWe had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.\u201d \u201cThey took this way?\u201d demanded Harry: \u201care you sure?\u201d \u201cAs I am that the men were at the window,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage garden from the meadow. \u201cThe tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.\u201d The two gentlemen watched Oliver\u2019s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said. Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it. The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men\u2019s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before. \u201cThis is strange!\u201d said Harry. \u201cStrange?\u201d echoed the doctor. \u201cBlathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.\u201d Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. Giles was dispatched to the different ale houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers. Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery. On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie repaired to the market town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself. Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all. But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark. Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face. After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides. At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments. \u201cA few\u2014a very few\u2014will suffice, Rose,\u201d said the young man, drawing his chair towards her. \u201cWhat I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.\u201d Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014ought to have left here, before,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou should, indeed,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cForgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.\u201d \u201cI was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,\u201d said the young man; \u201cthe fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.\u201d There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature. \u201cA creature,\u201d continued the young man, passionately, \u201ca creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God\u2019s own angels, fluttered between life and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you\u2014these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.\u201d \u201cI did not mean that,\u201d said Rose, weeping; \u201cI only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.\u201d \u201cThere is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,\u201d said the young man, taking her hand. \u201cRose, my own dear Rose! For years\u2014for years\u2014I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy\u2019s attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.\u201d \u201cYour behaviour has ever been kind and noble.\u201d said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated. \u201cAs you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.\u201d \u201cIt is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d replied Rose, \u201cthat you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.\u201d There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other. \u201cAnd your reasons, Rose,\u201d he said, at length, in a low voice; \u201cyour reasons for this decision?\u201d \u201cYou have a right to know them,\u201d rejoined Rose. \u201cYou can say nothing to alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.\u201d \u201cTo yourself?\u201d \u201cYes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects. I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.\u201d \u201cIf your inclinations chime with your sense of duty\u2014\u201d Harry began. \u201cThey do not,\u201d replied Rose, colouring deeply. \u201cThen you return my love?\u201d said Harry. \u201cSay but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!\u201d \u201cIf I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,\u201d rejoined Rose, \u201cI could have\u2014\u201d \u201cHave received this declaration very differently?\u201d said Harry. \u201cDo not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.\u201d \u201cI could,\u201d said Rose. \u201cStay!\u201d she added, disengaging her hand, \u201cwhy should we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met today, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!\u201d \u201cAnother word, Rose,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYour reason in your own words. From your own lips, let me hear it!\u201d \u201cThe prospect before you,\u201d answered Rose, firmly, \u201cis a brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother\u2019s place. In a word,\u201d said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, \u201cthere is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.\u201d \u201cOne word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!\u201d cried Harry, throwing himself before her. \u201cIf I had been less\u2014less fortunate, the world would call it\u2014if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny\u2014if I had been poor, sick, helpless\u2014would you have turned from me then? Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?\u201d \u201cDo not press me to reply,\u201d answered Rose. \u201cThe question does not arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.\u201d \u201cIf your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,\u201d retorted Harry, \u201cit will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!\u201d \u201cThen, if your lot had been differently cast,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cif you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.\u201d Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her. \u201cI cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,\u201d said Rose, extending her hand. \u201cI must leave you now, indeed.\u201d \u201cI ask one promise,\u201d said Harry. \u201cOnce, and only once more,\u2014say within a year, but it may be much sooner,\u2014I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.\u201d \u201cNot to press me to alter my right determination,\u201d replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; \u201cit will be useless.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry; \u201cto hear you repeat it, if you will\u2014finally repeat it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.\u201d \u201cThen let it be so,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cit is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.\u201d She extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room. CHAPTER XXXVI. IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES \u201cAnd so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?\u201d said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast table. \u201cWhy, you are not in the same mind or intention two half hours together!\u201d \u201cYou will tell me a different tale one of these days,\u201d said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason. \u201cI hope I may have good cause to do so,\u201d replied Mr. Losberne; \u201cthough I confess I don\u2019t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea side. Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London. And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, isn\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d \u201cI should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr. Maylie went away, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver. \u201cThat\u2019s a fine fellow,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cyou shall come and see me when you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?\u201d \u201cThe great nobs,\u201d replied Harry, \u201cunder which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cyou are a queer fellow. But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life. There\u2019s something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.\u201d Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, \u201cWe shall see,\u201d and pursued the subject no farther. The post chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed. \u201cOliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, \u201clet me speak a word with you.\u201d Oliver walked into the window recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed. \u201cYou can write well now?\u201d said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm. \u201cI hope so, sir,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me\u2014say once a fort night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London. Will you?\u201d \u201cOh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,\u201d exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission. \u201cI should like to know how\u2014how my mother and Miss Maylie are,\u201d said the young man; \u201cand you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she\u2014they, I mean\u2014seem happy and quite well. You understand me?\u201d \u201cOh! quite, sir, quite,\u201d replied Oliver. \u201cI would rather you did not mention it to them,\u201d said Harry, hurrying over his words; \u201cbecause it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.\u201d Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection. The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women servants were in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage. \u201cDrive on!\u201d he cried, \u201chard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, today.\u201d \u201cHalloa!\u201d cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; \u201csomething very short of flying will keep pace with _me_. Do you hear?\u201d Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted. It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed. And there was one looker on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself. \u201cHe seems in high spirits and happy,\u201d she said, at length. \u201cI feared for a time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very glad.\u201d Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose\u2019s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy. CHAPTER XXXVII. IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance. Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life. Nor was Mr. Bumble\u2019s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He still wore knee breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches. The coat was wide skirted; and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle. There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them. A field marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they? Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine. Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse. Another beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold laced coat, and staff, had all three descended. \u201cAnd tomorrow two months it was done!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. \u201cIt seems a age.\u201d Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh\u2014there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh. \u201cI sold myself,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of reflection, \u201cfor six teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, and a milk pot; with a small quantity of second hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I went very reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!\u201d \u201cCheap!\u201d cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble\u2019s ear: \u201cyou would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!\u201d Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture. \u201cMrs. Bumble, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness. \u201cWell!\u201d cried the lady. \u201cHave the goodness to look at me,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her. \u201cIf she stands such a eye as that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble to himself, \u201cshe can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. If it fails with her, my power is gone.\u201d Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble\u2019s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine. On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner. \u201cAre you going to sit snoring there, all day?\u201d inquired Mrs. Bumble. \u201cI am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble; \u201cand although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.\u201d \u201c_Your_ prerogative!\u201d sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt. \u201cI said the word, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cThe prerogative of a man is to command.\u201d \u201cAnd what\u2019s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?\u201d cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased. \u201cTo obey, ma\u2019am,\u201d thundered Mr. Bumble. \u201cYour late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now. I wish he was, poor man!\u201d Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears. But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble\u2019s soul; his heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health. \u201cIt opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cSo cry away.\u201d As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance. Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering. The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other. This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared. \u201cGet up!\u201d said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. \u201cAnd take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.\u201d Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what something desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door. \u201cAre you going?\u201d demanded Mrs. Bumble. \u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door. \u201cI didn\u2019t intend to\u2014I\u2019m going, my dear! You are so very violent, that really I\u2014\u201d At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field. Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward. This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities. The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office. But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded. \u201cHem!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. \u201cThese women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?\u201d With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t know I was here!\u201d repeated Mrs. Bumble. \u201cWhat do _you_ do here?\u201d \u201cI thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse master\u2019s humility. \u201c_You_ thought they were talking too much?\u201d said Mrs. Bumble. \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear\u2014\u201d urged Mr. Bumble submissively. \u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d demanded Mrs. Bumble, again. \u201cIt\u2019s very true, you\u2019re matron here, my dear,\u201d submitted Mr. Bumble; \u201cbut I thought you mightn\u2019t be in the way just then.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,\u201d returned his lady. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of your interference. You\u2019re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don\u2019t concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day. Be off; come!\u201d Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person. What could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen peckery. \u201cAll in two months!\u201d said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. \u201cTwo months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else\u2019s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!\u2014\u201d It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street. He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty. He passed a great many public houses; but, at length paused before one in a by way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer. It began to rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined him. Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street. The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak. He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation. Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin and water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance. It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him. Mr. Bumble\u2019s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger\u2019s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold. When they had encountered each other\u2019s glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence. \u201cWere you looking for me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you peered in at the window?\u201d \u201cNot that I am aware of, unless you\u2019re Mr.\u2014\u201d Here Mr. Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger\u2019s name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank. \u201cI see you were not,\u201d said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; \u201cor you have known my name. You don\u2019t know it. I would recommend you not to ask for it.\u201d \u201cI meant no harm, young man,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, majestically. \u201cAnd have done none,\u201d said the stranger. Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger. \u201cI have seen you before, I think?\u201d said he. \u201cYou were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?\u201d \u201cI was,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; \u201cporochial beadle.\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d rejoined the other, nodding his head. \u201cIt was in that character I saw you. What are you now?\u201d \u201cMaster of the workhouse,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume. \u201cMaster of the workhouse, young man!\u201d \u201cYou have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?\u201d resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble\u2019s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question. \u201cDon\u2019t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.\u201d \u201cI suppose, a married man,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, \u201cis not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.\u201d The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell. \u201cFill this glass again,\u201d he said, handing Mr. Bumble\u2019s empty tumbler to the landlord. \u201cLet it be strong and hot. You like it so, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNot too strong,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough. \u201cYou understand what that means, landlord!\u201d said the stranger, drily. The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr. Bumble\u2019s eyes. \u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the stranger, after closing the door and window. \u201cI came down to this place, today, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind. I want some information from you. I don\u2019t ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is. Put up that, to begin with.\u201d As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat pocket, he went on: \u201cCarry your memory back\u2014let me see\u2014twelve years, last winter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a long time,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cVery good. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d \u201cThe scene, the workhouse.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d \u201cAnd the time, night.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves\u2014gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot \u2019em in the grave!\u201d \u201cThe lying in room, I suppose?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the stranger\u2019s excited description. \u201cYes,\u201d said the stranger. \u201cA boy was born there.\u201d \u201cA many boys,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly. \u201cA murrain on the young devils!\u201d cried the stranger; \u201cI speak of one; a meek looking, pale faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin maker\u2014I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it\u2014and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\u201d \u201cWhy, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!\u201d said Mr. Bumble; \u201cI remember him, of course. There wasn\u2019t a obstinater young rascal\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not of him I want to hear; I\u2019ve heard enough of him,\u201d said the stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver\u2019s vices. \u201cIt\u2019s of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother. Where is she?\u201d \u201cWhere is she?\u201d said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin and water had rendered facetious. \u201cIt would be hard to tell. There\u2019s no midwifery there, whichever place she\u2019s gone to; so I suppose she\u2019s out of employment, anyway.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d demanded the stranger, sternly. \u201cThat she died last winter,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble. The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought. For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. With that he rose, as if to depart. But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half. He well remembered the night of old Sally\u2019s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman\u2019s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist. Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry. \u201cHow can I find her?\u201d said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence. \u201cOnly through me,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bumble. \u201cWhen?\u201d cried the stranger, hastily. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d rejoined Bumble. \u201cAt nine in the evening,\u201d said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; \u201cat nine in the evening, bring her to me there. I needn\u2019t tell you to be secret. It\u2019s your interest.\u201d With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night. On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him on the arm. \u201cFollowing me?\u201d \u201cOnly to ask a question,\u201d said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper. \u201cWhat name am I to ask for?\u201d \u201cMonks!\u201d rejoined the man; and strode hastily away. CHAPTER XXXVIII. CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river. They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though\u2014the way being dirty\u2014to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination. This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm eaten ship timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river\u2019s bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed. In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate. It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down. \u201cThe place should be somewhere here,\u201d said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand. \u201cHalloa there!\u201d cried a voice from above. Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast high, on the second story. \u201cStand still, a minute,\u201d cried the voice; \u201cI\u2019ll be with you directly.\u201d With which the head disappeared, and the door closed. \u201cIs that the man?\u201d asked Mr. Bumble\u2019s good lady. Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative. \u201cThen, mind what I told you,\u201d said the matron: \u201cand be careful to say as little as you can, or you\u2019ll betray us at once.\u201d Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards. \u201cCome in!\u201d he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me here!\u201d The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic. \u201cWhat the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?\u201d said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them. \u201cWe\u2014we were only cooling ourselves,\u201d stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him. \u201cCooling yourselves!\u201d retorted Monks. \u201cNot all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell\u2019s fire out, as a man can carry about with him. You won\u2019t cool yourself so easily; don\u2019t think it!\u201d With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground. \u201cThis is the woman, is it?\u201d demanded Monks. \u201cHem! That is the woman,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife\u2019s caution. \u201cYou think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?\u201d said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks. \u201cI know they will always keep _one_ till it\u2019s found out,\u201d said Monks. \u201cAnd what may that be?\u201d asked the matron. \u201cThe loss of their own good name,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cSo, by the same rule, if a woman\u2019s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I\u2019m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you understand, mistress?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d said Monks. \u201cHow should you?\u201d Bestowing something half way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre. \u201cHear it!\u201d he cried, shrinking back. \u201cHear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it. I hate the sound!\u201d He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured. \u201cThese fits come over me, now and then,\u201d said Monks, observing his alarm; \u201cand thunder sometimes brings them on. Don\u2019t mind me now; it\u2019s all over for this once.\u201d Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it. \u201cNow,\u201d said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, \u201cthe sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what it is, does she?\u201d The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it. \u201cHe is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something\u2014\u201d \u201cAbout the mother of the boy you named,\u201d replied the matron interrupting him. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe first question is, of what nature was her communication?\u201d said Monks. \u201cThat\u2019s the second,\u201d observed the woman with much deliberation. \u201cThe first is, what may the communication be worth?\u201d \u201cWho the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?\u201d asked Monks. \u201cNobody better than you, I am persuaded,\u201d answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke fellow could abundantly testify. \u201cHumph!\u201d said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; \u201cthere may be money\u2019s worth to get, eh?\u201d \u201cPerhaps there may,\u201d was the composed reply. \u201cSomething that was taken from her,\u201d said Monks. \u201cSomething that she wore. Something that\u2014\u201d \u201cYou had better bid,\u201d interrupted Mrs. Bumble. \u201cI have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.\u201d Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure. \u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you?\u201d asked the woman, as collectedly as before. \u201cIt may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cSpeak out, and let me know which.\u201d \u201cAdd five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five and twenty pounds in gold,\u201d said the woman; \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you all I know. Not before.\u201d \u201cFive and twenty pounds!\u201d exclaimed Monks, drawing back. \u201cI spoke as plainly as I could,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble. \u201cIt\u2019s not a large sum, either.\u201d \u201cNot a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it\u2019s told!\u201d cried Monks impatiently; \u201cand which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!\u201d \u201cSuch matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,\u201d answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed. \u201cAs to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!\u201d \u201cWhat if I pay it for nothing?\u201d asked Monks, hesitating. \u201cYou can easily take it away again,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cI am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.\u201d \u201cNot alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,\u201d submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: \u201c_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, \u201cMr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I\u2019m once roused. I only want a little rousing; that\u2019s all.\u201d As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose. \u201cYou are a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; \u201cand had better hold your tongue.\u201d \u201cHe had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can\u2019t speak in a lower tone,\u201d said Monks, grimly. \u201cSo! He\u2019s your husband, eh?\u201d \u201cHe my husband!\u201d tittered the matron, parrying the question. \u201cI thought as much, when you came in,\u201d rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. \u201cSo much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there\u2019s only one will between them. I\u2019m in earnest. See here!\u201d He thrust his hand into a side pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cgather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house top, is gone, let\u2019s hear your story.\u201d The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme. \u201cWhen this woman, that we called old Sally, died,\u201d the matron began, \u201cshe and I were alone.\u201d \u201cWas there no one by?\u201d asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; \u201cNo sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?\u201d \u201cNot a soul,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cwe were alone. _I_ stood alone beside the body when death came over it.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said Monks, regarding her attentively. \u201cGo on.\u201d \u201cShe spoke of a young creature,\u201d resumed the matron, \u201cwho had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.\u201d \u201cAy?\u201d said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, \u201cBlood! How things come about!\u201d \u201cThe child was the one you named to him last night,\u201d said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; \u201cthe mother this nurse had robbed.\u201d \u201cIn life?\u201d asked Monks. \u201cIn death,\u201d replied the woman, with something like a shudder. \u201cShe stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant\u2019s sake.\u201d \u201cShe sold it,\u201d cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; \u201cdid she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?\u201d \u201cAs she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,\u201d said the matron, \u201cshe fell back and died.\u201d \u201cWithout saying more?\u201d cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie! I\u2019ll not be played with. She said more. I\u2019ll tear the life out of you both, but I\u2019ll know what it was.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t utter another word,\u201d said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man\u2019s violence; \u201cbut she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.\u201d \u201cWhich contained\u2014\u201d interposed Monks, stretching forward. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cit was a pawnbroker\u2019s duplicate.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d demanded Monks. \u201cIn good time I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d said the woman. \u201cI judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker\u2019s interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.\u201d \u201cWhere is it now?\u201d asked Monks quickly. \u201c_There_,\u201d replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding ring. \u201cIt has the word \u2018Agnes\u2019 engraved on the inside,\u201d said the woman. \u201cThere is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.\u201d \u201cAnd this is all?\u201d said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet. \u201cAll,\u201d replied the woman. Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five and twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue. \u201cI know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,\u201d said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; \u201cand I want to know nothing; for it\u2019s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?\u201d \u201cYou may ask,\u201d said Monks, with some show of surprise; \u201cbut whether I answer or not is another question.\u201d \u201c\u2014Which makes three,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness. \u201cIs that what you expected to get from me?\u201d demanded the matron. \u201cIt is,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cThe other question?\u201d \u201cWhat do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d rejoined Monks; \u201cnor against me either. See here! But don\u2019t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.\u201d With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap door which opened close at Mr. Bumble\u2019s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation. \u201cLook down,\u201d said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. \u201cDon\u2019t fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.\u201d Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course. \u201cIf you flung a man\u2019s body down there, where would it be tomorrow morning?\u201d said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well. \u201cTwelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,\u201d replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought. Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone. The three looking into each other\u2019s faces, seemed to breathe more freely. \u201cThere!\u201d said Monks, closing the trap door, which fell heavily back into its former position. \u201cIf the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?\u201d said Monks, with a threatening look. \u201cI am not afraid of your wife.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon me, young man,\u201d answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. \u201cOn everybody\u2019s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.\u201d \u201cI am glad, for your sake, to hear it,\u201d remarked Monks. \u201cLight your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.\u201d It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water. They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap doors. The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside. They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted. CHAPTER XXXIX. INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was. The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane. Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\u2019s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration. The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great coat, by way of dressing gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\u2019s growth. The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention. Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber\u2019s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes\u2019s question. \u201cNot long gone seven,\u201d said the girl. \u201cHow do you feel tonight, Bill?\u201d \u201cAs weak as water,\u201d replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs. \u201cHere; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.\u201d Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes\u2019s temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her. \u201cWhining are you?\u201d said Sikes. \u201cCome! Don\u2019t stand snivelling there. If you can\u2019t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d \u201cI hear you,\u201d replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh. \u201cWhat fancy have you got in your head now?\u201d \u201cOh! you\u2019ve thought better of it, have you?\u201d growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye. \u201cAll the better for you, you have.\u201d \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say, you\u2019d be hard upon me tonight, Bill,\u201d said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder. \u201cNo!\u201d cried Mr. Sikes. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cSuch a number of nights,\u201d said the girl, with a touch of woman\u2019s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: \u201csuch a number of nights as I\u2019ve been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I\u2019ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\u2019t have served me as you did just now, if you\u2019d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d rejoined Mr. Sikes, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Why, damme, now, the girls\u2019s whining again!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. \u201cDon\u2019t you seem to mind me. It\u2019ll soon be over.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019ll be over?\u201d demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. \u201cWhat foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don\u2019t come over me with your woman\u2019s nonsense.\u201d At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy\u2019s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here, my dear?\u201d said Fagin, looking in. \u201cLend a hand to the girl, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t stand chattering and grinning at me!\u201d With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\u2019s assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient\u2019s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes. \u201cGive her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\u201d said Mr. Dawkins; \u201cand you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.\u201d These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked for appearance. \u201cWhy, what evil wind has blowed you here?\u201d he asked Fagin. \u201cNo evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I\u2019ve brought something good with me, that you\u2019ll be glad to see. Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.\u201d In compliance with Mr. Fagin\u2019s request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence. \u201cSitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\u201d exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; \u201csitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\u2019s no occasion to pick \u2019em; half a pound of seven and six penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\u2019ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn\u2019t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,\u2014oh no! Two half quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo\u2019ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!\u201d Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full sized wine bottle, carefully corked; while Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cAh!\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019ll do, Bill; you\u2019ll do now.\u201d \u201cDo!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Sikes; \u201cI might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you\u2019d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false hearted wagabond?\u201d \u201cOnly hear him, boys!\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cAnd us come to bring him all these beau ti ful things.\u201d \u201cThe things is well enough in their way,\u201d observed Mr. Sikes: a little soothed as he glanced over the table; \u201cbut what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that \u2019ere dog.\u2014Drive him down, Charley!\u201d \u201cI never see such a jolly dog as that,\u201d cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired. \u201cSmelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He\u2019d make his fortun\u2019 on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.\u201d \u201cHold your din,\u201d cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily. \u201cWhat have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?\u201d \u201cI was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cAnd what about the other fortnight?\u201d demanded Sikes. \u201cWhat about the other fortnight that you\u2019ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, Bill. I can\u2019t go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn\u2019t help it, upon my honour.\u201d \u201cUpon your what?\u201d growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. \u201cHere! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it\u2019ll choke me dead.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be out of temper, my dear,\u201d urged Fagin, submissively. \u201cI have never forgot you, Bill; never once.\u201d \u201cNo! I\u2019ll pound it that you han\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes, with a bitter grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn\u2019t been for the girl, I might have died.\u201d \u201cThere now, Bill,\u201d remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?\u201d \u201cHe says true enough there!\u201d said Nancy, coming hastily forward. \u201cLet him be; let him be.\u201d Nancy\u2019s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit bottle, he condescended to make. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d said Mr. Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some blunt from you tonight.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t a piece of coin about me,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cThen you\u2019ve got lots at home,\u201d retorted Sikes; \u201cand I must have some from there.\u201d \u201cLots!\u201d cried Fagin, holding up his hands. \u201cI haven\u2019t so much as would\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some tonight; and that\u2019s flat.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Fagin, with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019ll send the Artful round presently.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t do nothing of the kind,\u201d rejoined Mr. Sikes. \u201cThe Artful\u2019s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I\u2019ll lie down and have a snooze while she\u2019s gone.\u201d After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn\u2019t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady\u2019s return. In due course, they arrived at Fagin\u2019s abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go. \u201cHas nobody been, Toby?\u201d asked Fagin. \u201cNot a living leg,\u201d answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; \u201cit\u2019s been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I\u2019m as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\u2019t had the good natur\u2019 to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I\u2019m blessed if I an\u2019t!\u201d With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn\u2019t value his losses the snap of his little finger. \u201cWot a rum chap you are, Tom!\u201d said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration. \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling. \u201cAm I, Fagin?\u201d \u201cA very clever fellow, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils. \u201cAnd Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an\u2019t he, Fagin?\u201d asked Tom. \u201cNo doubt at all of that, my dear.\u201d \u201cAnd it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d pursued Tom. \u201cVery much so, indeed, my dear. They\u2019re only jealous, Tom, because he won\u2019t give it to them.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried Tom, triumphantly, \u201cthat\u2019s where it is! He has cleaned me out. But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d \u201cTo be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don\u2019t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It\u2019s time you were on the lay. Come! It\u2019s near ten, and nothing done yet.\u201d In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit. \u201cNow,\u201d said Fagin, when they had left the room, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get you that cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money, for I\u2019ve got none to lock up, my dear\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u2014none to lock up. It\u2019s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\u2019m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!\u201d he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; \u201cwho\u2019s that? Listen!\u201d The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man\u2019s voice reached her ears. The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time. \u201cBah!\u201d he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \u201cit\u2019s the man I expected before; he\u2019s coming downstairs. Not a word about the money while he\u2019s here, Nance. He won\u2019t stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.\u201d Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man\u2019s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her. It was Monks. \u201cOnly one of my young people,\u201d said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger. \u201cDon\u2019t move, Nancy.\u201d The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person. \u201cAny news?\u201d inquired Fagin. \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cAnd\u2014and\u2014good?\u201d asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine. \u201cNot bad, any way,\u201d replied Monks with a smile. \u201cI have been prompt enough this time. Let me have a word with you.\u201d The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room. \u201cNot that infernal hole we were in before,\u201d she could hear the man say as they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story. Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above. The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone. \u201cWhy, Nance!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, \u201chow pale you are!\u201d \u201cPale!\u201d echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him. \u201cQuite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?\u201d \u201cNothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\u2019t know how long and all,\u201d replied the girl carelessly. \u201cCome! Let me get back; that\u2019s a dear.\u201d With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand. They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a \u201cgood night.\u201d When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way. Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her return, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run. After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears. It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker. If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted. It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions. As that day closed in, the girl\u2019s excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment. Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him. \u201cWhy, burn my body!\u201d said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face. \u201cYou look like a corpse come to life again. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cMatter!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cNothing. What do you look at me so hard for?\u201d \u201cWhat foolery is this?\u201d demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly. \u201cWhat is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking of?\u201d \u201cOf many things, Bill,\u201d replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes. \u201cBut, Lord! What odds in that?\u201d The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them. \u201cI tell you wot it is,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cif you haven\u2019t caught the fever, and got it comin\u2019 on, now, there\u2019s something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too. You\u2019re not a going to\u2014. No, damme! you wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d \u201cDo what?\u201d asked the girl. \u201cThere ain\u2019t,\u201d said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; \u201cthere ain\u2019t a stauncher hearted gal going, or I\u2019d have cut her throat three months ago. She\u2019s got the fever coming on; that\u2019s it.\u201d Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents. \u201cNow,\u201d said the robber, \u201ccome and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I\u2019ll alter it so, that you won\u2019t know it agin when you do want it.\u201d The girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance. \u201cThe laudanum has taken effect at last,\u201d murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside. \u201cI may be too late, even now.\u201d She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\u2019s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber\u2019s lips; and then opening and closing the room door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house. A watchman was crying half past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare. \u201cHas it long gone the half hour?\u201d asked the girl. \u201cIt\u2019ll strike the hour in another quarter,\u201d said the man: raising his lantern to her face. \u201cAnd I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\u201d muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street. Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses\u2019 heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like. \u201cThe woman is mad!\u201d said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away. When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone. It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter\u2019s seat was vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs. \u201cNow, young woman!\u201d said a smartly dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, \u201cwho do you want here?\u201d \u201cA lady who is stopping in this house,\u201d answered the girl. \u201cA lady!\u201d was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. \u201cWhat lady?\u201d \u201cMiss Maylie,\u201d said Nancy. The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, Nancy repeated her request. \u201cWhat name am I to say?\u201d asked the waiter. \u201cIt\u2019s of no use saying any,\u201d replied Nancy. \u201cNor business?\u201d said the man. \u201cNo, nor that neither,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cI must see the lady.\u201d \u201cCome!\u201d said the man, pushing her towards the door. \u201cNone of this. Take yourself off.\u201d \u201cI shall be carried out if I go!\u201d said the girl violently; \u201cand I can make that a job that two of you won\u2019t like to do. Isn\u2019t there anybody here,\u201d she said, looking round, \u201cthat will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?\u201d This appeal produced an effect on a good tempered faced man cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere. \u201cTake it up for her, Joe; can\u2019t you?\u201d said this person. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good?\u201d replied the man. \u201cYou don\u2019t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?\u201d This allusion to Nancy\u2019s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel. \u201cDo what you like with me,\u201d said the girl, turning to the men again; \u201cbut do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty\u2019s sake.\u201d The soft hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to be?\u201d said the man, with one foot on the stairs. \u201cThat a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\u201d said Nancy; \u201cand that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.\u201d \u201cI say,\u201d said the man, \u201cyou\u2019re coming it strong!\u201d \u201cYou give the message,\u201d said the girl firmly; \u201cand let me hear the answer.\u201d The man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs. \u201cIt\u2019s no good being proper in this world,\u201d said the first housemaid. \u201cBrass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\u201d said the second. The third contented herself with wondering \u201cwhat ladies was made of\u201d; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of \u201cShameful!\u201d with which the Dianas concluded. Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired. CHAPTER XL. A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER The girl\u2019s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman\u2019s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview. But struggling with these better feelings was pride,\u2014the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self assured. The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,\u2014even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child. She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you\u2019d have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.\u201d \u201cI am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cDo not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the person you inquired for.\u201d The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears. \u201cOh, lady, lady!\u201d she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, \u201cif there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,\u2014there would\u2014there would!\u201d \u201cSit down,\u201d said Rose, earnestly. \u201cIf you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,\u2014I shall indeed. Sit down.\u201d \u201cLet me stand, lady,\u201d said the girl, still weeping, \u201cand do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late. Is\u2014is\u2014that door shut?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin\u2019s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.\u201d \u201cYou!\u201d said Rose Maylie. \u201cI, lady!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.\u201d \u201cWhat dreadful things are these!\u201d said Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion. \u201cThank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,\u201d cried the girl, \u201cthat you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and\u2014and\u2014something worse than all\u2014as I have been from my cradle. I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.\u201d \u201cI pity you!\u201d said Rose, in a broken voice. \u201cIt wrings my heart to hear you!\u201d \u201cHeaven bless you for your goodness!\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cIf you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Rose. \u201cHe knows you,\u201d replied the girl; \u201cand knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.\u201d \u201cI never heard the name,\u201d said Rose. \u201cThen he goes by some other amongst us,\u201d rejoined the girl, \u201cwhich I more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I\u2014suspecting this man\u2014listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. I found out, from what I heard, that Monks\u2014the man I asked you about, you know\u2014\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, \u201cI understand.\u201d \u201c\u2014That Monks,\u201d pursued the girl, \u201chad seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn\u2019t make out why. A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.\u201d \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d asked Rose. \u201cHe caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,\u201d said the girl; \u201cand there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.\u201d \u201cAnd what occurred then?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were these: \u2018So the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\u2019 They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil\u2019s money safely now, he\u2019d rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father\u2019s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.\u201d \u201cWhat is all this!\u201d said Rose. \u201cThe truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cThen, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy\u2019s life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn\u2019t, he\u2019d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. \u2018In short, Fagin,\u2019 he says, \u2018Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I\u2019ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\u2019\u201d \u201cHis brother!\u201d exclaimed Rose. \u201cThose were his words,\u201d said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually. \u201cAnd more. When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two legged spaniel was.\u201d \u201cYou do not mean,\u201d said Rose, turning very pale, \u201cto tell me that this was said in earnest?\u201d \u201cHe spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head. \u201cHe is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I know many who do worse things; but I\u2019d rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get back quickly.\u201d \u201cBut what can I do?\u201d said Rose. \u201cTo what use can I turn this communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour\u2019s delay.\u201d \u201cI wish to go back,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI must go back, because\u2014how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?\u2014because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can\u2019t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.\u201d \u201cYour having interfered in this dear boy\u2019s behalf before,\u201d said Rose; \u201cyour coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed. Oh!\u201d said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face, \u201cdo not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first\u2014the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.\u201d \u201cLady,\u201d cried the girl, sinking on her knees, \u201cdear, sweet, angel lady, you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!\u201d \u201cIt is never too late,\u201d said Rose, \u201cfor penitence and atonement.\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; \u201cI cannot leave him now! I could not be his death.\u201d \u201cWhy should you be?\u201d asked Rose. \u201cNothing could save him,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cIf I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!\u201d \u201cIs it possible,\u201d cried Rose, \u201cthat for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is madness.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d answered the girl; \u201cI only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself. I must go back. Whether it is God\u2019s wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.\u201d \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d said Rose. \u201cI should not let you depart from me thus.\u201d \u201cYou should, lady, and I know you will,\u201d rejoined the girl, rising. \u201cYou will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.\u201d \u201cOf what use, then, is the communication you have made?\u201d said Rose. \u201cThis mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?\u201d \u201cYou must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cBut where can I find you again when it is necessary?\u201d asked Rose. \u201cI do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?\u201d \u201cWill you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?\u201d asked the girl. \u201cI promise you solemnly,\u201d answered Rose. \u201cEvery Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,\u201d said the girl without hesitation, \u201cI will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.\u201d \u201cStay another moment,\u201d interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door. \u201cThink once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!\u201d \u201cWhen ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,\u201d replied the girl steadily, \u201cgive away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths\u2014even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? Pity us, lady\u2014pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.\u201d \u201cYou will,\u201d said Rose, after a pause, \u201ctake some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty\u2014at all events until we meet again?\u201d \u201cNot a penny,\u201d replied the girl, waving her hand. \u201cDo not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,\u201d said Rose, stepping gently forward. \u201cI wish to serve you indeed.\u201d \u201cYou would serve me best, lady,\u201d replied the girl, wringing her hands, \u201cif you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, tonight, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!\u201d Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts. CHAPTER XLI. CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver\u2019s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie\u2019s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope. They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight and forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion? Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\u2019s impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver\u2019s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl\u2019s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when\u2014the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection\u2014he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away. Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry. \u201cIf it be painful to him,\u201d she thought, \u201cto come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me\u2014he did when he went away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.\u201d And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep. She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr. Giles for a body guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm. \u201cWhat makes you look so flurried?\u201d asked Rose, advancing to meet him. \u201cI hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\u201d replied the boy. \u201cOh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!\u201d \u201cI never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\u201d said Rose, soothing him. \u201cBut what is this?\u2014of whom do you speak?\u201d \u201cI have seen the gentleman,\u201d replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, \u201cthe gentleman who was so good to me\u2014Mr. Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d asked Rose. \u201cGetting out of a coach,\u201d replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, \u201cand going into a house. I didn\u2019t speak to him\u2014I couldn\u2019t speak to him, for he didn\u2019t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did. Look here,\u201d said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \u201chere it is; here\u2019s where he lives\u2014I\u2019m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!\u201d With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account. \u201cQuick!\u201d she said. \u201cTell them to fetch a hackney coach, and be ready to go with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute\u2019s loss of time. I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.\u201d Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle green coat. At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon. \u201cDear me,\u201d said the gentleman, in the bottle green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, \u201cI beg your pardon, young lady\u2014I imagined it was some importunate person who\u2014I beg you will excuse me. Be seated, pray.\u201d \u201cMr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?\u201d said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken. \u201cThat is my name,\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is my friend, Mr. Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d interposed Miss Maylie, \u201cthat at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.\u201d Mr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again. \u201cI shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\u201d said Rose, naturally embarrassed; \u201cbut you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cOliver Twist you knew him as,\u201d replied Rose. The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach. Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie\u2019s, and said, \u201cDo me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\u2019s name put me in possession of it.\u201d \u201cA bad one! I\u2019ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face. \u201cHe is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\u201d said Rose, colouring; \u201cand that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only sixty one,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. \u201cAnd, as the devil\u2019s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don\u2019t see the application of that remark.\u201d \u201cDo not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201che does not mean what he says.\u201d \u201cYes, he does,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig. \u201cNo, he does not,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke. \u201cHe\u2019ll eat his head, if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d growled Mr. Grimwig. \u201cHe would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cAnd he\u2019d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\u201d responded Mr. Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor. Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom. \u201cNow, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cto return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.\u201d Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow\u2019s house; reserving Nancy\u2019s information for that gentleman\u2019s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend. \u201cThank God!\u201d said the old gentleman. \u201cThis is great happiness to me, great happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie. You must pardon my finding fault with you,\u2014but why not have brought him?\u201d \u201cHe is waiting in a coach at the door,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cAt this door!\u201d cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word. When the room door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface. \u201cHush!\u201d he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m old enough to be your grandfather. You\u2019re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!\u201d In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\u2019s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid. \u201cThere is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell. \u201cSend Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.\u201d The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders. \u201cWhy, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, rather testily. \u201cWell, that I do, sir,\u201d replied the old lady. \u201cPeople\u2019s eyes, at my time of life, don\u2019t improve with age, sir.\u201d \u201cI could have told you that,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u201cbut put on your glasses, and see if you can\u2019t find out what you were wanted for, will you?\u201d The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But Oliver\u2019s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms. \u201cGod be good to me!\u201d cried the old lady, embracing him; \u201cit is my innocent boy!\u201d \u201cMy dear old nurse!\u201d cried Oliver. \u201cHe would come back\u2014I knew he would,\u201d said the old lady, holding him in her arms. \u201cHow well he looks, and how like a gentleman\u2019s son he is dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.\u201d Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns. Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o\u2019clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home. Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\u2019s wrath. Nancy\u2019s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\u2019s consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and partly by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose. \u201cThen what the devil is to be done?\u201d said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies. \u201cAre we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\u201d \u201cNot exactly that,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; \u201cbut we must proceed gently and with great care.\u201d \u201cGentleness and care,\u201d exclaimed the doctor. \u201cI\u2019d send them one and all to\u2014\u201d \u201cNever mind where,\u201d interposed Mr. Brownlow. \u201cBut reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\u201d \u201cWhat object?\u201d asked the doctor. \u201cSimply, the discovery of Oliver\u2019s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket handkerchief; \u201cI almost forgot that.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Mr. Brownlow; \u201cplacing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?\u201d \u201cHanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\u201d suggested the doctor, \u201cand transporting the rest.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; \u201cbut no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest\u2014or at least to Oliver\u2019s, which is the same thing.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d inquired the doctor. \u201cThus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the doctor impetuously, \u201cI put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really\u2014\u201d \u201cDo not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. \u201cThe promise shall be kept. I don\u2019t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him. She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\u201d Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman\u2019s proposition was carried unanimously. \u201cI should like,\u201d he said, \u201cto call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.\u201d \u201cI have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWe must put it to the vote,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cwho may he be?\u201d \u201cThat lady\u2019s son, and this young lady\u2019s\u2014very old friend,\u201d said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece. Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee. \u201cWe stay in town, of course,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cwhile there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success. I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow. \u201cAnd as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver\u2019s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.\u201d With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and escorted her into the supper room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up. CHAPTER XLII. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER\u2019S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on her self imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention. They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long limbed, knock kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,\u2014looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys. The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back. Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough. This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion. Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion, \u201cCome on, can\u2019t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy load, I can tell you,\u201d said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue. \u201cHeavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?\u201d rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder. \u201cOh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain\u2019t enough to tire anybody\u2019s patience out, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d \u201cIs it much farther?\u201d asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face. \u201cMuch farther! Yer as good as there,\u201d said the long legged tramper, pointing out before him. \u201cLook there! Those are the lights of London.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a good two mile off, at least,\u201d said the woman despondingly. \u201cNever mind whether they\u2019re two mile off, or twenty,\u201d said Noah Claypole; for he it was; \u201cbut get up and come on, or I\u2019ll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.\u201d As Noah\u2019s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side. \u201cWhere do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?\u201d she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards. \u201cHow should I know?\u201d replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking. \u201cNear, I hope,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cNo, not near,\u201d replied Mr. Claypole. \u201cThere! Not near; so don\u2019t think it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cWhen I tell yer that I don\u2019t mean to do a thing, that\u2019s enough, without any why or because either,\u201d replied Mr. Claypole with dignity. \u201cWell, you needn\u2019t be so cross,\u201d said his companion. \u201cA pretty thing it would be, wouldn\u2019t it to go and stop at the very first public house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,\u201d said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. \u201cNo! I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out of the wayest house I can set eyes on. Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I\u2019ve got a head; for if we hadn\u2019t gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer\u2019d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer right for being a fool.\u201d \u201cI know I ain\u2019t as cunning as you are,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut don\u2019t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You would have been if I had been, any way.\u201d \u201cYer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,\u201d said Mr. Claypole. \u201cI took it for you, Noah, dear,\u201d rejoined Charlotte. \u201cDid I keep it?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole. \u201cNo; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,\u201d said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his. This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole\u2019s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape. Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together. In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest. Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John\u2019s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray\u2019s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London. Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose. At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night. \u201cSo give us the bundle,\u201d said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman\u2019s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; \u201cand don\u2019t yer speak, except when yer spoke to. What\u2019s the name of the house\u2014t h r\u2014three what?\u201d \u201cCripples,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cThree Cripples,\u201d repeated Noah, \u201cand a very good sign too. Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.\u201d With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion. There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him. If Noah had been attired in his charity boy\u2019s dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public house. \u201cIs this the Three Cripples?\u201d asked Noah. \u201cThat is the dabe of this \u2019ouse,\u201d replied the Jew. \u201cA gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,\u201d said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise. \u201cWe want to sleep here tonight.\u201d \u201cI\u2019b dot certaid you cad,\u201d said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; \u201cbut I\u2019ll idquire.\u201d \u201cShow us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?\u201d said Noah. Barney complied by ushering them into a small back room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment. Now, this back room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening\u2019s business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils. \u201cHush!\u201d said Barney: \u201cstradegers id the next roob.\u201d \u201cStrangers!\u201d repeated the old man in a whisper. \u201cAh! Ad rub uds too,\u201d added Barney. \u201cFrob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I\u2019b bistaked.\u201d Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest. Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure. \u201cAha!\u201d he whispered, looking round to Barney, \u201cI like that fellow\u2019s looks. He\u2019d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. Don\u2019t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear \u2019em talk\u2014let me hear \u2019em.\u201d He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin. \u201cSo I mean to be a gentleman,\u201d said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear. \u201cNo more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman\u2019s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.\u201d \u201cI should like that well enough, dear,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut tills ain\u2019t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.\u201d \u201cTills be blowed!\u201d said Mr. Claypole; \u201cthere\u2019s more things besides tills to be emptied.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his companion. \u201cPockets, women\u2019s ridicules, houses, mail coaches, banks!\u201d said Mr. Claypole, rising with the porter. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do all that, dear,\u201d said Charlotte. \u201cI shall look out to get into company with them as can,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.\u201d \u201cLor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!\u201d exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face. \u201cThere, that\u2019ll do: don\u2019t yer be too affectionate, in case I\u2019m cross with yer,\u201d said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. \u201cI should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of \u2019em, and follering \u2019em about, unbeknown to themselves. That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty pound note you\u2019ve got,\u2014especially as we don\u2019t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.\u201d After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him. The stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney. \u201cA pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands. \u201cFrom the country, I see, sir?\u201d \u201cHow do yer see that?\u201d asked Noah Claypole. \u201cWe have not so much dust as that in London,\u201d replied Fagin, pointing from Noah\u2019s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles. \u201cYer a sharp feller,\u201d said Noah. \u201cHa! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!\u201d \u201cWhy, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; \u201cand that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,\u2014a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner. \u201cGood stuff that,\u201d observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips. \u201cDear!\u201d said Fagin. \u201cA man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman\u2019s reticule, or a house, or a mail coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.\u201d Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. \u201cHa! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it was only me.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t take it,\u201d stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair; \u201cit was all her doing; yer\u2019ve got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.\u201d \u201cNo matter who\u2019s got it, or who did it, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk\u2019s eye at the girl and the two bundles. \u201cI\u2019m in that way myself, and I like you for it.\u201d \u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering. \u201cIn that way of business,\u201d rejoined Fagin; \u201cand so are the people of the house. You\u2019ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I\u2019ve said the word, and you may make your minds easy.\u201d Noah Claypole\u2019s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you more,\u201d said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. \u201cI have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.\u201d \u201cYer speak as if yer were in earnest,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhat advantage would it be to me to be anything else?\u201d inquired Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cHere! Let me have a word with you outside.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,\u201d said Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. \u201cShe\u2019ll take the luggage upstairs the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.\u201d This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out. \u201cShe\u2019s kept tolerably well under, ain\u2019t she?\u201d he asked as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal. \u201cQuite perfect,\u201d rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius, my dear.\u201d \u201cWhy, I suppose if I wasn\u2019t, I shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cBut, I say, she\u2019ll be back if yer lose time.\u201d \u201cNow, what do you think?\u201d said Fagin. \u201cIf you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?\u201d \u201cIs he in a good way of business; that\u2019s where it is!\u201d responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes. \u201cThe top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.\u201d \u201cRegular town maders?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole. \u201cNot a countryman among \u2019em; and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn\u2019t run rather short of assistants just now,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cShould I have to hand over?\u201d said Noah, slapping his breeches pocket. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be done without,\u201d replied Fagin, in a most decided manner. \u201cTwenty pound, though\u2014it\u2019s a lot of money!\u201d \u201cNot when it\u2019s in a note you can\u2019t get rid of,\u201d retorted Fagin. \u201cNumber and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It\u2019s not worth much to him. It\u2019ll have to go abroad, and he couldn\u2019t sell it for a great deal in the market.\u201d \u201cWhen could I see him?\u201d asked Noah doubtfully. \u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d \u201cUm!\u201d said Noah. \u201cWhat\u2019s the wages?\u201d \u201cLive like a gentleman\u2014board and lodging, pipes and spirits free\u2014half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,\u201d replied Mr. Fagin. Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him. \u201cBut, yer see,\u201d observed Noah, \u201cas she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.\u201d \u201cA little fancy work?\u201d suggested Fagin. \u201cAh! something of that sort,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhat do you think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know. That\u2019s the sort of thing!\u201d \u201cI heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cMy friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.\u201d \u201cWhy, I did mention that, and I shouldn\u2019t mind turning my hand to it sometimes,\u201d rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t pay by itself, you know.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate. \u201cNo, it might not.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think, then?\u201d asked Noah, anxiously regarding him. \u201cSomething in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of the old ladies?\u201d asked Fagin. \u201cThere\u2019s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?\u201d asked Noah, shaking his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would answer my purpose. Ain\u2019t there any other line open?\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s knee. \u201cThe kinchin lay.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d demanded Mr. Claypole. \u201cThe kinchins, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cis the young children that\u2019s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away\u2014they\u2019ve always got it ready in their hands,\u2014then knock \u2019em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy. \u201cLord, that\u2019s the very thing!\u201d \u201cTo be sure it is,\u201d replied Fagin; \u201cand you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they\u2019re always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!\u201d With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all right!\u201d said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and Charlotte had returned. \u201cWhat time tomorrow shall we say?\u201d \u201cWill ten do?\u201d asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent, \u201cWhat name shall I tell my good friend.\u201d \u201cMr. Bolter,\u201d replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency. \u201cMr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.\u201d \u201cMrs. Bolter\u2019s humble servant,\u201d said Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness. \u201cI hope I shall know her better very shortly.\u201d \u201cDo you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?\u201d thundered Mr. Claypole. \u201cYes, Noah, dear!\u201d replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand. \u201cShe calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,\u201d said Mr. Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. \u201cYou understand?\u201d \u201cOh yes, I understand\u2014perfectly,\u201d replied Fagin, telling the truth for once. \u201cGood night! Good night!\u201d With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady\u2019s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity. CHAPTER XLIII. WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE \u201cAnd so it was you that was your own friend, was it?\u201d asked Mr. Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between them, he had removed next day to Fagin\u2019s house. \u201cCod, I thought as much last night!\u201d \u201cEvery man\u2019s his own friend, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, with his most insinuating grin. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t as good a one as himself anywhere.\u201d \u201cExcept sometimes,\u201d replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of the world. \u201cSome people are nobody\u2019s enemies but their own, yer know.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t believe that,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cWhen a man\u2019s his own enemy, it\u2019s only because he\u2019s too much his own friend; not because he\u2019s careful for everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain\u2019t such a thing in nature.\u201d \u201cThere oughn\u2019t to be, if there is,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cThat stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven. It\u2019s neither, my friend, neither. It\u2019s number one.\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Mr. Bolter. \u201cNumber one for ever.\u201d \u201cIn a little community like ours, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position, \u201cwe have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.\u201d \u201cOh, the devil!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Bolter. \u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, \u201cwe are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so. For instance, it\u2019s your object to take care of number one\u2014meaning yourself.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cYer about right there.\u201d \u201cWell! You can\u2019t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.\u201d \u201cNumber two, you mean,\u201d said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d retorted Fagin. \u201cI\u2019m of the same importance to you, as you are to yourself.\u201d \u201cI say,\u201d interrupted Mr. Bolter, \u201cyer a very nice man, and I\u2019m very fond of yer; but we ain\u2019t quite so thick together, as all that comes to.\u201d \u201cOnly think,\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his hands; \u201conly consider. You\u2019ve done what\u2019s a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that\u2019s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose\u2014in plain English, the halter!\u201d Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance. \u201cThe gallows,\u201d continued Fagin, \u201cthe gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow\u2019s career on the broad highway. To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.\u201d \u201cOf course it is,\u201d replied Mr. Bolter. \u201cWhat do yer talk about such things for?\u201d \u201cOnly to show you my meaning clearly,\u201d said the Jew, raising his eyebrows. \u201cTo be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the second my number one. The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first\u2014that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. \u201cOh! yer a cunning old codger!\u201d Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter\u2019s respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken. \u201cIt\u2019s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cMy best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he died?\u201d cried Mr. Bolter. \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cnot so bad as that. Not quite so bad.\u201d \u201cWhat, I suppose he was\u2014\u201d \u201cWanted,\u201d interposed Fagin. \u201cYes, he was wanted.\u201d \u201cVery particular?\u201d inquired Mr. Bolter. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cnot very. He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff box on him,\u2014his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They remanded him till today, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I\u2019d give the price of as many to have him back. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.\u201d \u201cWell, but I shall know him, I hope; don\u2019t yer think so?\u201d said Mr. Bolter. \u201cI\u2019m doubtful about it,\u201d replied Fagin, with a sigh. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get any fresh evidence, it\u2019ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it\u2019s a case of lagging. They know what a clever lad he is; he\u2019ll be a lifer. They\u2019ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by lagging and a lifer?\u201d demanded Mr. Bolter. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way to me; why don\u2019t yer speak so as I can understand yer?\u201d Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words, \u201ctransportation for life,\u201d when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi comical woe. \u201cIt\u2019s all up, Fagin,\u201d said Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more\u2019s a coming to \u2019dentify him; and the Artful\u2019s booked for a passage out,\u201d replied Master Bates. \u201cI must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To think of Jack Dawkins\u2014lummy Jack\u2014the Dodger\u2014the Artful Dodger\u2014going abroad for a common twopenny halfpenny sneeze box! I never thought he\u2019d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why didn\u2019t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!\u201d With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency. \u201cWhat do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!\u201d exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. \u201cWasn\u2019t he always the top sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent! Eh?\u201d \u201cNot one,\u201d replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; \u201cnot one.\u201d \u201cThen what do you talk of?\u201d replied Fagin angrily; \u201cwhat are you blubbering for?\u201d \u201c\u2019Cause it isn\u2019t on the rec ord, is it?\u201d said Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets; \u201c\u2019cause it can\u2019t come out in the \u2019dictment; \u2019cause nobody will never know half of what he was. How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar? P\u2019raps not be there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; \u201csee what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cNever mind, Charley,\u201d said Fagin soothingly; \u201cit\u2019ll come out, it\u2019ll be sure to come out. They\u2019ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he\u2019ll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how young he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!\u201d \u201cWell, it is a honour that is!\u201d said Charley, a little consoled. \u201cHe shall have all he wants,\u201d continued the Jew. \u201cHe shall be kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can\u2019t spend it.\u201d \u201cNo, shall he though?\u201d cried Charley Bates. \u201cAy, that he shall,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand we\u2019ll have a big wig, Charley: one that\u2019s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we\u2019ll read it all in the papers\u2014\u2018Artful Dodger\u2014shrieks of laughter\u2014here the court was convulsed\u2019\u2014eh, Charley, eh?\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d laughed Master Bates, \u201cwhat a lark that would be, wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother \u2019em wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWould!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cHe shall\u2014he will!\u201d \u201cAh, to be sure, so he will,\u201d repeated Charley, rubbing his hands. \u201cI think I see him now,\u201d cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil. \u201cSo do I,\u201d cried Charley Bates. \u201cHa! ha! ha! so do I. I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game! All the big wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of \u2019em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge\u2019s own son making a speech arter dinner\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u201d In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend\u2019s eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities. \u201cWe must know how he gets on today, by some handy means or other,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cLet me think.\u201d \u201cShall I go?\u201d asked Charley. \u201cNot for the world,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cAre you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you\u2019d walk into the very place where\u2014No, Charley, no. One is enough to lose at a time.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to go yourself, I suppose?\u201d said Charley with a humorous leer. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d replied Fagin shaking his head. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you send this new cove?\u201d asked Master Bates, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s arm. \u201cNobody knows him.\u201d \u201cWhy, if he didn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d observed Fagin. \u201cMind!\u201d interposed Charley. \u201cWhat should he have to mind?\u201d \u201cReally nothing, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, \u201creally nothing.\u201d \u201cOh, I dare say about that, yer know,\u201d observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. \u201cNo, no\u2014none of that. It\u2019s not in my department, that ain\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWot department has he got, Fagin?\u201d inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah\u2019s lank form with much disgust. \u201cThe cutting away when there\u2019s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there\u2019s everything right; is that his branch?\u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d retorted Mr. Bolter; \u201cand don\u2019t yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer\u2019ll find yerself in the wrong shop.\u201d Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will. Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin\u2019s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner\u2019s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter\u2019s whip. Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection. These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting. Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which\u2014Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality\u2014were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way. He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice. There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. A jailer stood reclining against the dock rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman \u201cTake that baby out,\u201d when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half smothered in the mother\u2019s shawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was an old smoky bust over the mantel shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock\u2014the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it. Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character\u2019s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit. It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that \u2019ere disgraceful sitivation for. \u201cHold your tongue, will you?\u201d said the jailer. \u201cI\u2019m an Englishman, ain\u2019t I?\u201d rejoined the Dodger. \u201cWhere are my priwileges?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll get your privileges soon enough,\u201d retorted the jailer, \u201cand pepper with \u2019em.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr. Dawkins. \u201cNow then! Wot is this here business? I shall thank the madg\u2019strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I\u2019ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he\u2019ll go away if I ain\u2019t there to my time, and then pr\u2019aps ther won\u2019t be an action for damage against them as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!\u201d At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate \u201cthe names of them two files as was on the bench.\u201d Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request. \u201cSilence there!\u201d cried the jailer. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d inquired one of the magistrates. \u201cA pick pocketing case, your worship.\u201d \u201cHas the boy ever been here before?\u201d \u201cHe ought to have been, a many times,\u201d replied the jailer. \u201cHe has been pretty well everywhere else. _I_ know him well, your worship.\u201d \u201cOh! you know me, do you?\u201d cried the Artful, making a note of the statement. \u201cWery good. That\u2019s a case of deformation of character, any way.\u201d Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence. \u201cNow then, where are the witnesses?\u201d said the clerk. \u201cAh! that\u2019s right,\u201d added the Dodger. \u201cWhere are they? I should like to see \u2019em.\u201d This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance. For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff box, with the owner\u2019s name engraved upon the lid. This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to. He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him. \u201cHave you anything to ask this witness, boy?\u201d said the magistrate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,\u201d replied the Dodger. \u201cHave you anything to say at all?\u201d \u201cDo you hear his worship ask if you\u2019ve anything to say?\u201d inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction. \u201cDid you redress yourself to me, my man?\u201d \u201cI never see such an out and out young wagabond, your worship,\u201d observed the officer with a grin. \u201cDo you mean to say anything, you young shaver?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the Dodger, \u201cnot here, for this ain\u2019t the shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and \u2019spectable circle of acquaintance as\u2019ll make them beaks wish they\u2019d never been born, or that they\u2019d got their footmen to hang \u2019em up to their own hat pegs, afore they let \u2019em come out this morning to try it on upon me. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \u201cThere! He\u2019s fully committed!\u201d interposed the clerk. \u201cTake him away.\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d said the jailer. \u201cOh ah! I\u2019ll come on,\u201d replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand. \u201cAh! (to the Bench) it\u2019s no use your looking frightened; I won\u2019t show you no mercy, not a ha\u2019porth of it. _You\u2019ll_ pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn\u2019t be you for something! I wouldn\u2019t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!\u201d With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer\u2019s face, with great glee and self approval. Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person. The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation. CHAPTER XLIV. THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE FAILS. Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last\u2014richly as he merited such a fate\u2014by her hand. But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her\u2014and what more could she do! She was resolved. Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards\u2014she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions. It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour. Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven. \u201cAn hour this side of midnight,\u201d said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat. \u201cDark and heavy it is too. A good night for business this.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cWhat a pity, Bill, my dear, that there\u2019s none quite ready to be done.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right for once,\u201d replied Sikes gruffly. \u201cIt is a pity, for I\u2019m in the humour too.\u201d Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly. \u201cWe must make up for lost time when we\u2019ve got things into a good train. That\u2019s all I know,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to talk, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder. \u201cIt does me good to hear you.\u201d \u201cDoes you good, does it!\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cWell, so be it.\u201d \u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession. \u201cYou\u2019re like yourself tonight, Bill. Quite like yourself.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,\u201d said Sikes, casting off the Jew\u2019s hand. \u201cIt make you nervous, Bill,\u2014reminds you of being nabbed, does it?\u201d said Fagin, determined not to be offended. \u201cReminds me of being nabbed by the devil,\u201d returned Sikes. \u201cThere never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old \u2019un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn\u2019t wonder at, a bit.\u201d Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room. \u201cHallo!\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cNance. Where\u2019s the gal going to at this time of night?\u201d \u201cNot far.\u201d \u201cWhat answer\u2019s that?\u201d retorted Sikes. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know where,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cThen I do,\u201d said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. \u201cNowhere. Sit down.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not well. I told you that before,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cI want a breath of air.\u201d \u201cPut your head out of the winder,\u201d replied Sikes. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough there,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI want it in the street.\u201d \u201cThen you won\u2019t have it,\u201d replied Sikes. With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press. \u201cThere,\u201d said the robber. \u201cNow stop quietly where you are, will you?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,\u201d said the girl turning very pale. \u201cWhat do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d \u201cKnow what I\u2019m\u2014Oh!\u201d cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, \u201cshe\u2019s out of her senses, you know, or she daren\u2019t talk to me in that way.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll drive me on the something desperate,\u201d muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak. \u201cLet me go, will you,\u2014this minute\u2014this instant.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Sikes. \u201cTell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It\u2019ll be better for him. Do you hear me?\u201d cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground. \u201cHear you!\u201d repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her. \u201cAye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as\u2019ll tear some of that screaming voice out. Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?\u201d \u201cLet me go,\u201d said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, \u201cBill, let me go; you don\u2019t know what you are doing. You don\u2019t, indeed. For only one hour\u2014do\u2014do!\u201d \u201cCut my limbs off one by one!\u201d cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, \u201cIf I don\u2019t think the gal\u2019s stark raving mad. Get up.\u201d \u201cNot till you let me go\u2014not till you let me go\u2014Never\u2014never!\u201d screamed the girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force. She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o\u2019clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further. With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin. \u201cWhew!\u201d said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face. \u201cWot a precious strange gal that is!\u201d \u201cYou may say that, Bill,\u201d replied Fagin thoughtfully. \u201cYou may say that.\u201d \u201cWot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for, do you think?\u201d asked Sikes. \u201cCome; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?\u201d \u201cObstinacy; woman\u2019s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.\u201d \u201cWell, I suppose it is,\u201d growled Sikes. \u201cI thought I had tamed her, but she\u2019s as bad as ever.\u201d \u201cWorse,\u201d said Fagin thoughtfully. \u201cI never knew her like this, for such a little cause.\u201d \u201cNor I,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won\u2019t come out\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cLike enough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she\u2019s took that way again,\u201d said Sikes. Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment. \u201cShe was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cWe was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it\u2019s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a whisper. \u201cHush!\u201d As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing. \u201cWhy, now she\u2019s on the other tack!\u201d exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion. Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good night. He paused when he reached the room door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs. \u201cLight him down,\u201d said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight seers. Show him a light.\u201d Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper. \u201cWhat is it, Nancy, dear?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied the girl, in the same tone. \u201cThe reason of all this,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cIf _he_\u201d\u2014he pointed with his skinny fore finger up the stairs\u2014\u201cis so hard with you (he\u2019s a brute, Nance, a brute beast), why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers. \u201cNo matter just now. We\u2019ll talk of this again. You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog\u2014like a dog! worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes\u2014come to me. I say, come to me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.\u201d \u201cI know you well,\u201d replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion. \u201cGood night.\u201d She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them. Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain. He had conceived the idea\u2014not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees\u2014that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker\u2019s brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty. The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons. He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay. There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked\u2014to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life\u2014on the object of her more recent fancy. \u201cWith a little persuasion,\u201d thought Fagin, \u201cwhat more likely than that she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now. There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.\u201d These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker\u2019s room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting showed _that_. But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained. \u201cHow,\u201d thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, \u201ccan I increase my influence with her? What new power can I acquire?\u201d Such brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance? \u201cI can,\u201d said Fagin, almost aloud. \u201cShe durst not refuse me then. Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall be set to work. I shall have you yet!\u201d He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers. CHAPTER XLV. NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast. \u201cBolter,\u201d said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter. \u201cWell, here I am,\u201d returned Noah. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. That\u2019s a great fault in this place. Yer never get time enough over yer meals.\u201d \u201cYou can talk as you eat, can\u2019t you?\u201d said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend\u2019s greediness from the very bottom of his heart. \u201cOh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,\u201d said Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread. \u201cWhere\u2019s Charlotte?\u201d \u201cOut,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cI sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Noah. \u201cI wish yer\u2019d ordered her to make some buttered toast first. Well. Talk away. Yer won\u2019t interrupt me.\u201d There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business. \u201cYou did well yesterday, my dear,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cBeautiful! Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you forget to add three pint pots and a milk can,\u201d said Mr. Bolter. \u201cNo, no, my dear. The pint pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece.\u201d \u201cPretty well, I think, for a beginner,\u201d remarked Mr. Bolter complacently. \u201cThe pots I took off airy railings, and the milk can was standing by itself outside a public house. I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second. \u201cI want you, Bolter,\u201d said Fagin, leaning over the table, \u201cto do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.\u201d \u201cI say,\u201d rejoined Bolter, \u201cdon\u2019t yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o\u2019 yer police offices. That don\u2019t suit me, that don\u2019t; and so I tell yer.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the smallest danger in it\u2014not the very smallest,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cit\u2019s only to dodge a woman.\u201d \u201cAn old woman?\u201d demanded Mr. Bolter. \u201cA young one,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cI can do that pretty well, I know,\u201d said Bolter. \u201cI was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not to\u2014\u201d \u201cNot to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019ll yer give me?\u201d asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face. \u201cIf you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,\u201d said Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn\u2019t valuable consideration to be gained.\u201d \u201cWho is she?\u201d inquired Noah. \u201cOne of us.\u201d \u201cOh Lor!\u201d cried Noah, curling up his nose. \u201cYer doubtful of her, are yer?\u201d \u201cShe has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cI see,\u201d said Noah. \u201cJust to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they\u2019re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I\u2019m your man.\u201d \u201cI knew you would be,\u201d cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal. \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhere is she? Where am I to wait for her? Where am I to go?\u201d \u201cAll that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I\u2019ll point her out at the proper time,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cYou keep ready, and leave the rest to me.\u201d That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter\u2019s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin. Six nights passed\u2014six long weary nights\u2014and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. It was Sunday. \u201cShe goes abroad tonight,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cand on the right errand, I\u2019m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!\u201d Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London. It was past eleven o\u2019clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them. Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room. \u201cIs that the woman?\u201d he asked, scarcely above his breath. Fagin nodded yes. \u201cI can\u2019t see her face well,\u201d whispered Noah. \u201cShe is looking down, and the candle is behind her.\u201d \u201cStay there,\u201d whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face. \u201cI see her now,\u201d cried the spy. \u201cPlainly?\u201d \u201cI should know her among a thousand.\u201d He hastily descended, as the room door opened, and the girl came out. Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered. \u201cHist!\u201d cried the lad who held the door. \u201cDow.\u201d Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out. \u201cTo the left,\u201d whispered the lad; \u201ctake the left had, and keep od the other side.\u201d He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl\u2019s retreating figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her. CHAPTER XLVI. THE APPOINTMENT KEPT The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot passengers, turned back. The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The man stopped too. It was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London\u2019s destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed. A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old smoke stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight. The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro\u2014closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer\u2014when the heavy bell of St. Paul\u2019s tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded city. The palace, the night cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all. The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them. They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up\u2014brushed against them, indeed\u2014at that precise moment. \u201cNot here,\u201d said Nancy hurriedly, \u201cI am afraid to speak to you here. Come away\u2014out of the public road\u2014down the steps yonder!\u201d As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on. The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, form a landing stairs from the river. To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment\u2019s survey of the place, he began to descend. These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety. So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear. He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively. \u201cThis is far enough,\u201d said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman. \u201cI will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.\u201d \u201cTo humour me!\u201d cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed. \u201cYou\u2019re considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it\u2019s no matter.\u201d \u201cWhy, for what,\u201d said the gentleman in a kinder tone, \u201cfor what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?\u201d \u201cI told you before,\u201d replied Nancy, \u201cthat I was afraid to speak to you there. I don\u2019t know why it is,\u201d said the girl, shuddering, \u201cbut I have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that I can hardly stand.\u201d \u201cA fear of what?\u201d asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her. \u201cI scarcely know of what,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI wish I did. Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was reading a book tonight, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.\u201d \u201cImagination,\u201d said the gentleman, soothing her. \u201cNo imagination,\u201d replied the girl in a hoarse voice. \u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw \u2018coffin\u2019 written in every page of the book in large black letters,\u2014aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets tonight.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing unusual in that,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cThey have passed me often.\u201d \u201c_Real ones_,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cThis was not.\u201d There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him. He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies. \u201cSpeak to her kindly,\u201d said the young lady to her companion. \u201cPoor creature! She seems to need it.\u201d \u201cYour haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am tonight, and preached of flames and vengeance,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cOh, dear lady, why ar\u2019n\u2019t those who claim to be God\u2019s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cA Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven. Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!\u201d These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself. The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her. \u201cYou were not here last Sunday night,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t come,\u201d replied Nancy; \u201cI was kept by force.\u201d \u201cBy whom?\u201d \u201cHim that I told the young lady of before.\u201d \u201cYou were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight, I hope?\u201d asked the old gentleman. \u201cNo,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn\u2019t give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.\u201d \u201cDid he awake before you returned?\u201d inquired the gentleman. \u201cNo; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNow listen to me.\u201d \u201cI am ready,\u201d replied the girl, as he paused for a moment. \u201cThis young lady,\u201d the gentleman began, \u201chas communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d said the girl earnestly. \u201cI repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.\u201d \u201cFagin,\u201d cried the girl, recoiling. \u201cThat man must be delivered up by you,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cI will not do it! I will never do it!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cDevil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.\u201d \u201cYou will not?\u201d said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer. \u201cNever!\u201d returned the girl. \u201cTell me why?\u201d \u201cFor one reason,\u201d rejoined the girl firmly, \u201cfor one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I\u2019ll not turn upon them, who might\u2014any of them\u2014have turned upon me, but didn\u2019t, bad as they are.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain; \u201cput Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.\u201d \u201cWhat if he turns against the others?\u201d \u201cI promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver\u2019s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.\u201d \u201cAnd if it is not?\u201d suggested the girl. \u201cThen,\u201d pursued the gentleman, \u201cthis Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent. In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.\u201d \u201cHave I the lady\u2019s promise for that?\u201d asked the girl. \u201cYou have,\u201d replied Rose. \u201cMy true and faithful pledge.\u201d \u201cMonks would never learn how you knew what you do?\u201d said the girl, after a short pause. \u201cNever,\u201d replied the gentleman. \u201cThe intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.\u201d \u201cI have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,\u201d said the girl after another interval of silence, \u201cbut I will take your words.\u201d After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public house whence she had been followed that night. From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection. \u201cHe is tall,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don\u2019t forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man\u2019s, that you might almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can\u2019t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds\u2014why did you start?\u201d said the girl, stopping suddenly. The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed. \u201cPart of this,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak. I think that\u2019s all I can give you to know him by. Stay though,\u201d she added. \u201cUpon his throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is\u2014\u201d \u201cA broad red mark, like a burn or scald?\u201d cried the gentleman. \u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d said the girl. \u201cYou know him!\u201d The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe. \u201cI think I do,\u201d said the gentleman, breaking silence. \u201cI should by your description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other. It may not be the same.\u201d As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, \u201cIt must be he!\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he had stood before, \u201cyou have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve you?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Nancy. \u201cYou will not persist in saying that,\u201d rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart. \u201cThink now. Tell me.\u201d \u201cNothing, sir,\u201d rejoined the girl, weeping. \u201cYou can do nothing to help me. I am past all hope, indeed.\u201d \u201cYou put yourself beyond its pale,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cThe past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you. Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!\u201d \u201cShe will be persuaded now,\u201d cried the young lady. \u201cShe hesitates, I am sure.\u201d \u201cI fear not, my dear,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cNo sir, I do not,\u201d replied the girl, after a short struggle. \u201cI am chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it. I must have gone too far to turn back,\u2014and yet I don\u2019t know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off. But,\u201d she said, looking hastily round, \u201cthis fear comes over me again. I must go home.\u201d \u201cHome!\u201d repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word. \u201cHome, lady,\u201d rejoined the girl. \u201cTo such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be watched or seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.\u201d \u201cIt is useless,\u201d said the gentleman, with a sigh. \u201cWe compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her longer than she expected already.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d urged the girl. \u201cYou have.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d cried the young lady, \u201ccan be the end of this poor creature\u2019s life!\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d repeated the girl. \u201cLook before you, lady. Look at that dark water. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.\u201d \u201cDo not speak thus, pray,\u201d returned the young lady, sobbing. \u201cIt will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cGood night, good night!\u201d The gentleman turned away. \u201cThis purse,\u201d cried the young lady. \u201cTake it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d replied the girl. \u201cI have not done this for money. Let me have that to think of. And yet\u2014give me something that you have worn: I should like to have something\u2014no, no, not a ring\u2014your gloves or handkerchief\u2014anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good night, good night!\u201d The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested. The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased. The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs. \u201cHark!\u201d cried the young lady, listening. \u201cDid she call! I thought I heard her voice.\u201d \u201cNo, my love,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. \u201cShe has not moved, and will not till we are gone.\u201d Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears. After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended. Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the Jew\u2019s house as fast as his legs would carry him. CHAPTER XLVII. FATAL CONSEQUENCES It was nearly two hours before day break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit. He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he bit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog\u2019s or rat\u2019s. Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep. Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere. Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart. He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street. \u201cAt last,\u201d he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. \u201cAt last!\u201d The bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes. \u201cThere!\u201d he said, laying the bundle on the table. \u201cTake care of that, and do the most you can with it. It\u2019s been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.\u201d Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright. \u201cWot now?\u201d cried Sikes. \u201cWot do you look at a man so for?\u201d Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone. \u201cDamme!\u201d said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. \u201cHe\u2019s gone mad. I must look to myself here.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014you\u2019re not the person, Bill. I\u2019ve no\u2014no fault to find with you.\u201d \u201cOh, you haven\u2019t, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky\u2014for one of us. Which one that is, don\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got that to tell you, Bill,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer, \u201cwill make you worse than me.\u201d \u201cAye?\u201d returned the robber with an incredulous air. \u201cTell away! Look sharp, or Nance will think I\u2019m lost.\u201d \u201cLost!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cShe has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.\u201d Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew\u2019s face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly. \u201cSpeak, will you!\u201d he said; \u201cor if you don\u2019t, it shall be for want of breath. Open your mouth and say wot you\u2019ve got to say in plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!\u201d \u201cSuppose that lad that\u2019s laying there\u2014\u201d Fagin began. Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him. \u201cWell!\u201d he said, resuming his former position. \u201cSuppose that lad,\u201d pursued Fagin, \u201cwas to peach\u2014to blow upon us all\u2014first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with \u2019em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken. Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plan we\u2019ve all been in, more or less\u2014of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,\u2014but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them. Do you hear me?\u201d cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage. \u201cSuppose he did all this, what then?\u201d \u201cWhat then!\u201d replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. \u201cIf he was left alive till I came, I\u2019d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.\u201d \u201cWhat if I did it!\u201d cried Fagin almost in a yell. \u201cI, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion. \u201cI\u2019d do something in the jail that \u2019ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I\u2019d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I should have such strength,\u201d muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, \u201cthat I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.\u201d \u201cYou would?\u201d \u201cWould I!\u201d said the housebreaker. \u201cTry me.\u201d \u201cIf it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care who,\u201d replied Sikes impatiently. \u201cWhoever it was, I\u2019d serve them the same.\u201d Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him. Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in. \u201cBolter, Bolter! Poor lad!\u201d said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis. \u201cHe\u2019s tired\u2014tired with watching for her so long,\u2014watching for _her_, Bill.\u201d \u201cWot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d asked Sikes, drawing back. Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him. \u201cTell me that again\u2014once again, just for him to hear,\u201d said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke. \u201cTell yer what?\u201d asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly. \u201cThat about\u2014 _Nancy_,\u201d said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. \u201cYou followed her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cTo London Bridge?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere she met two people.\u201d \u201cSo she did.\u201d \u201cA gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did\u2014and to describe him, which she did\u2014and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did\u2014and where it could be best watched from, which she did\u2014and what time the people went there, which she did. She did all this. She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur\u2014she did\u2014did she not?\u201d cried Fagin, half mad with fury. \u201cAll right,\u201d replied Noah, scratching his head. \u201cThat\u2019s just what it was!\u201d \u201cWhat did they say, about last Sunday?\u201d \u201cAbout last Sunday!\u201d replied Noah, considering. \u201cWhy I told yer that before.\u201d \u201cAgain. Tell it again!\u201d cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips. \u201cThey asked her,\u201d said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, \u201cthey asked her why she didn\u2019t come, last Sunday, as she promised. She said she couldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014why? Tell him that.\u201d \u201cBecause she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,\u201d replied Noah. \u201cWhat more of him?\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cWhat more of the man she had told them of before? Tell him that, tell him that.\u201d \u201cWhy, that she couldn\u2019t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,\u201d said Noah; \u201cand so the first time she went to see the lady, she\u2014ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did\u2014she gave him a drink of laudanum.\u201d \u201cHell\u2019s fire!\u201d cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. \u201cLet me go!\u201d Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs. \u201cBill, Bill!\u201d cried Fagin, following him hastily. \u201cA word. Only a word.\u201d The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up. \u201cLet me out,\u201d said Sikes. \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me; it\u2019s not safe. Let me out, I say!\u201d \u201cHear me speak a word,\u201d rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock. \u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d replied the other. \u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014too\u2014violent, Bill?\u201d The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other\u2019s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken. \u201cI mean,\u201d said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, \u201cnot too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.\u201d Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets. Without one pause, or moment\u2019s consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door. He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed. The girl was lying, half dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look. \u201cGet up!\u201d said the man. \u201cIt is you, Bill!\u201d said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return. \u201cIt is,\u201d was the reply. \u201cGet up.\u201d There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain. \u201cLet it be,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. \u201cThere\u2019s enough light for wot I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d \u201cBill,\u201d said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, \u201cwhy do you look like that at me!\u201d The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth. \u201cBill, Bill!\u201d gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,\u2014\u201cI\u2014I won\u2019t scream or cry\u2014not once\u2014hear me\u2014speak to me\u2014tell me what I have done!\u201d \u201cYou know, you she devil!\u201d returned the robber, suppressing his breath. \u201cYou were watched tonight; every word you said was heard.\u201d \u201cThen spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,\u201d rejoined the girl, clinging to him. \u201cBill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you. You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill, for dear God\u2019s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!\u201d The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away. \u201cBill,\u201d cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, \u201cthe gentleman and that dear lady, told me tonight of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent. They told me so\u2014I feel it now\u2014but we must have time\u2014a little, little time!\u201d The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own. She staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief\u2014Rose Maylie\u2019s own\u2014and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker. It was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down. CHAPTER XLVIII. THE FLIGHT OF SIKES Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London\u2019s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst. Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel. The sun\u2014the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man\u2014burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory. Through costly coloured glass and paper mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray. It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light! He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again. And there was the body\u2014mere flesh and blood, no more\u2014but such flesh, and so much blood! He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody. All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house. He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay nearly under there. _He_ knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot! The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away. He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept. Soon he was up again, and away,\u2014not far into the country, but back towards London by the high road\u2014then back again\u2014then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed\u2014then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches\u2019 brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again. Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people\u2019s way. Thither he directed his steps,\u2014running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\u2019s pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when he got there, all the people he met\u2014the very children at the doors\u2014seemed to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go. He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield. It was nine o\u2019clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot. There was a fire in the tap room, and some country labourers were drinking before it. They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time. The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young\u2014not older, one white haired grandfather said, than he was\u2014with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least\u2014if he had taken care; if he had taken care. There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer. This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back. His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement. \u201cAnd what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?\u201d asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition cakes in one corner. \u201cThis,\u201d said the fellow, producing one, \u201cthis is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff. Wine stains, fruit stains, beer stains, water stains, paint stains, pitch stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she\u2019s cured at once\u2014for it\u2019s poison. If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question\u2014for it\u2019s quite as satisfactory as a pistol bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one penny a square!\u201d There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity. \u201cIt\u2019s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\u201d said the fellow. \u201cThere are fourteen water mills, six steam engines, and a galvanic battery, always a working upon it, and they can\u2019t make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins. One penny a square! Two half pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy. One penny a square! Wine stains, fruit stains, beer stains, water stains, paint stains, pitch stains, mud stains, blood stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I\u2019ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.\u201d \u201cHah!\u201d cried Sikes starting up. \u201cGive that back.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take it clean out, sir,\u201d replied the man, winking to the company, \u201cbefore you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman\u2019s hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half crown. Whether it is a wine stain, fruit stain, beer stain, water stain, paint stain, pitch stain, mud stain, or blood stain\u2014\u201d The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house. With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post office. He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened. The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter bag. A man, dressed like a game keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement. \u201cThat\u2019s for your people,\u201d said the guard. \u201cNow, look alive in there, will you. Damn that \u2019ere bag, it warn\u2019t ready night afore last; this won\u2019t do, you know!\u201d \u201cAnything new up in town, Ben?\u201d asked the game keeper, drawing back to the window shutters, the better to admire the horses. \u201cNo, nothing that I knows on,\u201d replied the man, pulling on his gloves. \u201cCorn\u2019s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don\u2019t reckon much upon it.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s quite true,\u201d said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window. \u201cAnd a dreadful murder it was.\u201d \u201cWas it, sir?\u201d rejoined the guard, touching his hat. \u201cMan or woman, pray, sir?\u201d \u201cA woman,\u201d replied the gentleman. \u201cIt is supposed\u2014\u201d \u201cNow, Ben,\u201d replied the coachman impatiently. \u201cDamn that \u2019ere bag,\u201d said the guard; \u201care you gone to sleep in there?\u201d \u201cComing!\u201d cried the office keeper, running out. \u201cComing,\u201d growled the guard. \u201cAh, and so\u2019s the young \u2019ooman of property that\u2019s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\u2019t know when. Here, give hold. All ri\u2014ight!\u201d The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone. Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go. At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St. Albans. He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning\u2019s ghastly figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry. If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it followed\u2014not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell. At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now\u2014always. He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night sky. He threw himself upon the road\u2014on his back upon the road. At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still\u2014a living grave stone, with its epitaph in blood. Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear. There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night. Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall\u2014to undergo new torture. For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing. There were but two, but they were everywhere. If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well known object\u2014some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory\u2014each in its accustomed place. The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away. He got up, and rushed into the field without. The figure was behind him. He re entered the shed, and shrunk down once more. The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along. And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air. The broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food. The noise increased as he looked. There were people there\u2014men and women\u2014light, bustle. It was like new life to him. He darted onward\u2014straight, headlong\u2014dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him. He came upon the spot. There were half dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red hot beams. The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground. Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers. The clanking of the engine pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar. He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained. This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder. \u201cHe has gone to Birmingham, they say,\u201d said one: \u201cbut they\u2019ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by tomorrow night there\u2019ll be a cry all through the country.\u201d He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night. Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London. \u201cThere\u2019s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\u201d he thought. \u201cA good hiding place, too. They\u2019ll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent. Why can\u2019t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I\u2019ll risk it.\u201d He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination. The dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went. The animal looked up into his master\u2019s face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber\u2019s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along. When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright. \u201cDo you hear me call? Come here!\u201d cried Sikes. The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back. \u201cCome back!\u201d said the robber. The dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and called him again. The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed. The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey. CHAPTER XLIX. MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a hackney coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks. They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr. Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back room. At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped. The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions. \u201cHe knows the alternative,\u201d said Mr. Browlow. \u201cIf he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.\u201d \u201cHow dare you say this of me?\u201d asked Monks. \u201cHow dare you urge me to it, young man?\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting him with a steady look. \u201cAre you mad enough to leave this house? Unhand him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am resolute and immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!\u201d \u201cBy what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?\u201d asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him. \u201cBy mine,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cThose persons are indemnified by me. If you complain of being deprived of your liberty\u2014you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet\u2014I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.\u201d Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated. \u201cYou will decide quickly,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure. \u201cIf you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way. If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole days.\u201d Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still. \u201cYou will be prompt,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cA word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.\u201d Still the man hesitated. \u201cI have not the inclination to parley,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.\u201d \u201cIs there\u2014\u201d demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,\u2014\u201cis there\u2014no middle course?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down. \u201cLock the door on the outside,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, \u201cand come when I ring.\u201d The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together. \u201cThis is pretty treatment, sir,\u201d said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, \u201cfrom my father\u2019s oldest friend.\u201d \u201cIt is because I was your father\u2019s oldest friend, young man,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow; \u201cit is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters\u2019s death bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would\u2014but Heaven willed otherwise\u2014have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now\u2014yes, Edward Leeford, even now\u2014and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.\u201d \u201cWhat has the name to do with it?\u201d asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion. \u201cWhat is the name to me?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cnothing to you. But it was _hers_, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger. I am very glad you have changed it\u2014very\u2014very.\u201d \u201cThis is all mighty fine,\u201d said Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand. \u201cBut what do you want with me?\u201d \u201cYou have a brother,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: \u201ca brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.\u201d \u201cI have no brother,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cYou know I was an only child. Why do you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.\u201d \u201cAttend to what I do know, and you may not,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI shall interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care for hard names,\u201d interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh. \u201cYou know the fact, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d \u201cBut I also know,\u201d pursued the old gentleman, \u201cthe misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union. I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But it rusted and cankered at your father\u2019s heart for years.\u201d \u201cWell, they were separated,\u201d said Monks, \u201cand what of that?\u201d \u201cWhen they had been separated for some time,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends. This circumstance, at least, you know already.\u201d \u201cNot I,\u201d said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. \u201cNot I.\u201d \u201cYour manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one and thirty\u2014for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?\u201d \u201cI have nothing to disclose,\u201d rejoined Monks. \u201cYou must talk on if you will.\u201d \u201cThese new friends, then,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cwere a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half a year before, and left him with two children\u2014there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s this to me?\u201d asked Monks. \u201cThey resided,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, \u201cin a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted as few men are. He had his sister\u2019s soul and person. As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him. I would that it had ended there. His daughter did the same.\u201d The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed: \u201cThe end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.\u201d \u201cYour tale is of the longest,\u201d observed Monks, moving restlessly in his chair. \u201cIt is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,\u201d returned Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often\u2014it is no uncommon case\u2014died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs\u2014Money. It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will\u2014_no will_\u2014so that the whole property fell to her and you.\u201d At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker. As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands. \u201cBefore he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other\u2019s face, \u201che came to me.\u201d \u201cI never heard of that,\u201d interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise. \u201cHe came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture\u2014a portrait painted by himself\u2014a likeness of this poor girl\u2014which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country\u2014I guessed too well he would not fly alone\u2014and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both\u2014even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas! _That_ was the last time. I had no letter, and I never saw him more.\u201d \u201cI went,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, \u201cI went, when all was over, to the scene of his\u2014I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him\u2014of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night. Why, or whither, none can tell.\u201d Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph. \u201cWhen your brother,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other\u2019s chair, \u201cWhen your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d cried Monks. \u201cBy me,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI told you I should interest you before long. I say by me\u2014I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for aught he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Monks hastily. \u201cBecause you know it well.\u201d \u201cI!\u201d \u201cDenial to me is vain,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cI shall show you that I know more than that.\u201d \u201cYou\u2014you\u2014can\u2019t prove anything against me,\u201d stammered Monks. \u201cI defy you to do it!\u201d \u201cWe shall see,\u201d returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. \u201cI lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies\u2014whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother\u2019s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here\u2014I made the voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had no clue to your residence. You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy. I wearied them with new applications. I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.\u201d \u201cAnd now you do see me,\u201d said Monks, rising boldly, \u201cwhat then? Fraud and robbery are high sounding words\u2014justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man\u2019s Brother! You don\u2019t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don\u2019t even know that.\u201d \u201cI _did not_,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; \u201cbut within the last fortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know it, and him. There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the place of his birth. There existed proofs\u2014proofs long suppressed\u2014of his birth and parentage. Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \u2018_the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\u2019 Unworthy son, coward, liar,\u2014you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,\u2014you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,\u2014you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father\u2019s heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind\u2014you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!\u201d \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges. \u201cEvery word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cevery word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d interposed Monks. \u201cI\u2014I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I didn\u2019t know the cause. I thought it was a common quarrel.\u201d \u201cIt was the partial disclosure of your secrets,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cWill you disclose the whole?\u201d \u201cYes, I will.\u201d \u201cSet your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?\u201d \u201cThat I promise too.\u201d \u201cRemain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?\u201d \u201cIf you insist upon that, I\u2019ll do that also,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cYou must do more than that,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cMake restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten the provisions of the will. Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please. In this world you need meet no more.\u201d While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation. \u201cThe man will be taken,\u201d he cried. \u201cHe will be taken tonight!\u201d \u201cThe murderer?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d replied the other. \u201cHis dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering about in every direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government tonight.\u201d \u201cI will give fifty more,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, \u201cand proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?\u201d \u201cHarry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cand mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.\u201d \u201cFagin,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow; \u201cwhat of him?\u201d \u201cWhen I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time. They\u2019re sure of him.\u201d \u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of Monks. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2014will be secret with me?\u201d \u201cI will. Remain here till I return. It is your only hope of safety.\u201d They left the room, and the door was again locked. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked the doctor in a whisper. \u201cAll that I could hope to do, and even more. Coupling the poor girl\u2019s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend\u2019s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day. Write and appoint the evening after tomorrow, at seven, for the meeting. We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest: especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now. But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature. Which way have they taken?\u201d \u201cDrive straight to the office and you will be in time,\u201d replied Mr. Losberne. \u201cI will remain here.\u201d The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable. CHAPTER L. THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close built low roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants. To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion. The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman\u2019s door, and stream from the house parapet and windows. Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast heavers, coal whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner. Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect. In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob\u2019s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name. At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him. Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it\u2014as some have done; dirt besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch. In Jacob\u2019s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke. Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob\u2019s Island. In an upper room of one of these houses\u2014a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described\u2014there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion. This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, \u201cthat you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you, blunder head!\u201d said Kags. \u201cWell, I thought you\u2019d have been a little more glad to see me than this,\u201d replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air. \u201cWhy, look\u2019e, young gentleman,\u201d said Toby, \u201cwhen a man keeps himself so very ex clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it\u2019s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.\u201d \u201cEspecially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that\u2019s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,\u201d added Mr. Kags. There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care swagger, turned to Chitling and said, \u201cWhen was Fagin took then?\u201d \u201cJust at dinner time\u2014two o\u2019clock this afternoon. Charley and I made our lucky up the wash us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.\u201d \u201cAnd Bet?\u201d \u201cPoor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,\u201d replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, \u201cand went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait weskut on her and took her to the hospital\u2014and there she is.\u201d \u201cWot\u2019s come of young Bates?\u201d demanded Kags. \u201cHe hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d replied Chitling. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken\u2014I went up there and see it with my own eyes\u2014is filled with traps.\u201d \u201cThis is a smash,\u201d observed Toby, biting his lips. \u201cThere\u2019s more than one will go with this.\u201d \u201cThe sessions are on,\u201d said Kags: \u201cif they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King\u2019s evidence: as of course he will, from what he\u2019s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he\u2019ll swing in six days from this, by G\u2014!\u201d \u201cYou should have heard the people groan,\u201d said Chitling; \u201cthe officers fought like devils, or they\u2019d have torn him away. He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends. I can see \u2019em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst \u2019em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they\u2019d tear his heart out!\u201d The horror stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted. While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes\u2019s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen. \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d said Toby when they had returned. \u201cHe can\u2019t be coming here. I\u2014I\u2014hope not.\u201d \u201cIf he was coming here, he\u2019d have come with the dog,\u201d said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. \u201cHere! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s drunk it all up, every drop,\u201d said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence. \u201cCovered with mud\u2014lame\u2014half blind\u2014he must have come a long way.\u201d \u201cWhere can he have come from!\u201d exclaimed Toby. \u201cHe\u2019s been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he\u2019s been many a time and often. But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!\u201d \u201cHe\u201d\u2014(none of them called the murderer by his old name)\u2014\u201cHe can\u2019t have made away with himself. What do you think?\u201d said Chitling. Toby shook his head. \u201cIf he had,\u201d said Kags, \u201cthe dog \u2019ud want to lead us away to where he did it. No. I think he\u2019s got out of the country, and left the dog behind. He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201d This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody. It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table. The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position. They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound. They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room. They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below. \u201cYoung Bates,\u201d said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself. The knocking came again. No, it wasn\u2019t he. He never knocked like that. Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door. \u201cWe must let him in,\u201d he said, taking up the candle. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any help for it?\u201d asked the other man in a hoarse voice. \u201cNone. He _must_ come in.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t leave us in the dark,\u201d said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished. Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days\u2019 growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes. He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall\u2014as close as it would go\u2014and ground it against it\u2014and sat down. Not a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in silence. If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted. When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have heard its tones before. \u201cHow came that dog here?\u201d he asked. \u201cAlone. Three hours ago.\u201d \u201cTonight\u2019s paper says that Fagin\u2019s took. Is it true, or a lie?\u201d \u201cTrue.\u201d They were silent again. \u201cDamn you all!\u201d said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead. \u201cHave you nothing to say to me?\u201d There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke. \u201cYou that keep this house,\u201d said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, \u201cdo you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?\u201d \u201cYou may stop here, if you think it safe,\u201d returned the person addressed, after some hesitation. Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it: and said, \u201cIs\u2014it\u2014the body\u2014is it buried?\u201d They shook their heads. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it!\u201d he retorted with the same glance behind him. \u201cWot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?\u2014Who\u2019s that knocking?\u201d Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him. Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure. \u201cToby,\u201d said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me this, downstairs?\u201d There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him. \u201cLet me go into some other room,\u201d said the boy, retreating still farther. \u201cCharley!\u201d said Sikes, stepping forward. \u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014don\u2019t you know me?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t come nearer me,\u201d answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer\u2019s face. \u201cYou monster!\u201d The man stopped half way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes\u2019s eyes sunk gradually to the ground. \u201cWitness you three,\u201d cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke. \u201cWitness you three\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of him\u2014if they come here after him, I\u2019ll give him up; I will. I tell you out at once. He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I\u2019ll give him up. I\u2019d give him up if he was to be boiled alive. Murder! Help! If there\u2019s the pluck of a man among you three, you\u2019ll help me. Murder! Help! Down with him!\u201d Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground. The three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer\u2019s breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might. The contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps\u2014endless they seemed in number\u2014crossing the nearest wooden bridge. One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail. \u201cHelp!\u201d shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air. \u201cHe\u2019s here! Break down the door!\u201d \u201cIn the King\u2019s name,\u201d cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder. \u201cBreak down the door!\u201d screamed the boy. \u201cI tell you they\u2019ll never open it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!\u201d Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent. \u201cOpen the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell babe,\u201d cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. \u201cThat door. Quick!\u201d He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key. \u201cIs the downstairs door fast?\u201d \u201cDouble locked and chained,\u201d replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered. \u201cThe panels\u2014are they strong?\u201d \u201cLined with sheet iron.\u201d \u201cAnd the windows too?\u201d \u201cYes, and the windows.\u201d \u201cDamn you!\u201d cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd. \u201cDo your worst! I\u2019ll cheat you yet!\u201d Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead. Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, \u201cTwenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!\u201d The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called for ladders, some for sledge hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar. \u201cThe tide,\u201d cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, \u201cthe tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a long rope. They\u2019re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.\u201d The panic stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house top. All the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body. But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream. He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet. The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud. The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it rose. Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him. On pressed the people from the front\u2014on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house top. Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch. \u201cThey have him now,\u201d cried a man on the nearest bridge. \u201cHurrah!\u201d The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose. \u201cI will give fifty pounds,\u201d cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, \u201cto the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.\u201d There was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased. The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion. Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop. At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm pits, and when the old gentleman before mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down\u2014at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror. \u201cThe eyes again!\u201d he cried in an unearthly screech. Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for five and thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand. The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God\u2019s sake. A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man\u2019s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains. CHAPTER LI. AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN MONEY The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, in a travelling carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow followed in a post chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned. They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree. He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense. The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne\u2019s assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that had so recently taken place. \u201cIt was quite true,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.\u201d So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all. But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head. \u201cSee there, there!\u201d cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; \u201cthat\u2019s the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!\u201d \u201cYou will see him soon,\u201d replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own. \u201cYou shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cand we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,\u2014shall we?\u201d Rose nodded \u201cyes,\u201d for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak. \u201cYou will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cIt will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again\u2014I know that too\u2014to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He said \u2018God bless you\u2019 to me when I ran away,\u201d cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; \u201cand I will say \u2018God bless you\u2019 now, and show him how I love him for it!\u201d As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds. There was Sowerberry\u2019s the undertaker\u2019s just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it\u2014there were all the well known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected\u2014there was Gamfield\u2019s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public house door\u2014there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street\u2014there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again\u2014there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well\u2014there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream. But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head\u2014no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic. Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart. Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices. At length, when nine o\u2019clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room. Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door. Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated. \u201cThis is a painful task,\u201d said he, \u201cbut these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said the person addressed, turning away his face. \u201cQuick. I have almost done enough, I think. Don\u2019t keep me here.\u201d \u201cThis child,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, \u201cis your half brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose heart he might have heard. \u201cThat is the bastard child.\u201d \u201cThe term you use,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, \u201cis a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He was born in this town.\u201d \u201cIn the workhouse of this town,\u201d was the sullen reply. \u201cYou have the story there.\u201d He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke. \u201cI must have it here, too,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners. \u201cListen then! You!\u201d returned Monks. \u201cHis father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her\u2014to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her. He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself\u201d; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; \u201cand enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead. One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.\u201d \u201cWhat of the letter?\u201d asked Mr. Brownlow. \u201cThe letter?\u2014A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery\u2014to be explained one day\u2014prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back. She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement. He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his. He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her\u2014prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before\u2014and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted. I believe he had.\u201d \u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver\u2019s tears fell fast. Monks was silent. \u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, \u201cwas in the same spirit as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions\u2014one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age. If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong. He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction\u2014only strengthened by approaching death\u2014that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature. If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.\u201d \u201cMy mother,\u201d said Monks, in a louder tone, \u201cdid what a woman should have done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot. The girl\u2019s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate\u2014I love her for it now\u2014could add. Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed. The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.\u201d There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative. \u201cYears after this,\u201d he said, \u201cthis man\u2019s\u2014Edward Leeford\u2019s\u2014mother came to me. He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died. Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to France.\u201d \u201cThere she died,\u201d said Monks, \u201cafter a lingering illness; and, on her death bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved\u2014though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive. I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it, if I could, to the very gallows foot. She was right. He came in my way at last. I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!\u201d As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him. \u201cThe locket and ring?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks. \u201cI bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,\u201d answered Monks without raising his eyes. \u201cYou know what became of them.\u201d Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him. \u201cDo my hi\u2019s deceive me!\u201d cried Mr. Bumble, with ill feigned enthusiasm, \u201cor is that little Oliver? Oh O li ver, if you know\u2019d how I\u2019ve been a grieving for you\u2014\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, fool,\u201d murmured Mrs. Bumble. \u201cIsn\u2019t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?\u201d remonstrated the workhouse master. \u201cCan\u2019t I be supposed to feel\u2014_I_ as brought him up porochially\u2014when I see him a setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description! I always loved that boy as if he\u2019d been my\u2014my\u2014my own grandfather,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison. \u201cMaster Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.\u201d \u201cCome, sir,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; \u201csuppress your feelings.\u201d \u201cI will do my endeavours, sir,\u201d replied Mr. Bumble. \u201cHow do you do, sir? I hope you are very well.\u201d This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he pointed to Monks, \u201cDo you know that person?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble flatly. \u201cPerhaps _you_ don\u2019t?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse. \u201cI never saw him in all my life,\u201d said Mr. Bumble. \u201cNor sold him anything, perhaps?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs. Bumble. \u201cYou never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the matron. \u201cWhy are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?\u201d Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked. \u201cYou shut the door the night old Sally died,\u201d said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d \u201cWe heard her try to tell you what she\u2019d done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker\u2019s shop,\u201d said the first. \u201cYes,\u201d added the second, \u201cand it was a \u2018locket and gold ring.\u2019 We found out that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were by.\u201d \u201cAnd we know more than that,\u201d resumed the first, \u201cfor she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.\u201d \u201cWould you like to see the pawnbroker himself?\u201d asked Mr. Grimwig with a motion towards the door. \u201cNo,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cif he\u201d\u2014she pointed to Monks\u2014\u201chas been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. I _did_ sell them, and they\u2019re where you\u2019ll never get them. What then?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow, \u201cexcept that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You may leave the room.\u201d \u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: \u201cI hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?\u201d \u201cIndeed it will,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYou may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.\u201d \u201cIt was all Mrs. Bumble. She _would_ do it,\u201d urged Mr. Bumble; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room. \u201cThat is no excuse,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cYou were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.\u201d \u201cIf the law supposes that,\u201d said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, \u201cthe law is a ass\u2014a idiot. If that\u2019s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience\u2014by experience.\u201d Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs. \u201cYoung lady,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, \u201cgive me your hand. Do not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.\u201d \u201cIf they have\u2014I do not know how they can, but if they have\u2014any reference to me,\u201d said Rose, \u201cpray let me hear them at some other time. I have not strength or spirits now.\u201d \u201cNay,\u201d returned the old gentleman, drawing her arm through his; \u201cyou have more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady, sir?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Monks. \u201cI never saw you before,\u201d said Rose faintly. \u201cI have seen you often,\u201d returned Monks. \u201cThe father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow. \u201cWhat was the fate of the other\u2014the child?\u201d \u201cThe child,\u201d replied Monks, \u201cwhen her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced\u2014the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. \u201cGo on!\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t find the spot to which these people had repaired,\u201d said Monks, \u201cbut where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My mother found it, after a year of cunning search\u2014ay, and found the child.\u201d \u201cShe took it, did she?\u201d \u201cNo. The people were poor and began to sicken\u2014at least the man did\u2014of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send. She didn\u2019t quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child\u2019s unhappiness, but told the history of the sister\u2019s shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other. The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home. There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy. I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.\u201d \u201cDo you see her now?\u201d \u201cYes. Leaning on your arm.\u201d \u201cBut not the less my niece,\u201d cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; \u201cnot the less my dearest child. I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own dear girl!\u201d \u201cThe only friend I ever had,\u201d cried Rose, clinging to her. \u201cThe kindest, best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all this.\u201d \u201cYou have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, embracing her tenderly. \u201cCome, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here\u2014look, look, my dear!\u201d \u201cNot aunt,\u201d cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; \u201cI\u2019ll never call her aunt\u2014sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!\u201d Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment. Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain. They were a long, long time alone. A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without. Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie. \u201cI know it all,\u201d he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. \u201cDear Rose, I know it all.\u201d \u201cI am not here by accident,\u201d he added after a lengthened silence; \u201cnor have I heard all this tonight, for I knew it yesterday\u2014only yesterday. Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?\u201d \u201cStay,\u201d said Rose. \u201cYou _do_ know all.\u201d \u201cAll. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d \u201cNot to press you to alter your determination,\u201d pursued the young man, \u201cbut to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.\u201d \u201cThe same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,\u201d said Rose firmly. \u201cIf I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should tonight? It is a struggle,\u201d said Rose, \u201cbut one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.\u201d \u201cThe disclosure of tonight,\u201d\u2014Harry began. \u201cThe disclosure of tonight,\u201d replied Rose softly, \u201cleaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.\u201d \u201cYou harden your heart against me, Rose,\u201d urged her lover. \u201cOh Harry, Harry,\u201d said the young lady, bursting into tears; \u201cI wish I could, and spare myself this pain.\u201d \u201cThen why inflict it on yourself?\u201d said Harry, taking her hand. \u201cThink, dear Rose, think what you have heard tonight.\u201d \u201cAnd what have I heard! What have I heard!\u201d cried Rose. \u201cThat a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all\u2014there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.\u201d \u201cNot yet, not yet,\u201d said the young man, detaining her as she rose. \u201cMy hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home\u2014a heart and home\u2014yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean!\u201d she faltered. \u201cI mean but this\u2014that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it. This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. Such power and patronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England\u2019s richest county; and by one village church\u2014mine, Rose, my own!\u2014there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket handkerchief from over his head. Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time. Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation. \u201cI had serious thoughts of eating my head tonight,\u201d said Mr. Grimwig, \u201cfor I began to think I should get nothing else. I\u2019ll take the liberty, if you\u2019ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.\u201d Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a clergyman. \u201cOliver, my child,\u201d said Mrs. Maylie, \u201cwhere have you been, and why do you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this moment. What is the matter?\u201d It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour. Poor Dick was dead! CHAPTER LII. FAGIN\u2019S LAST NIGHT ALIVE The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man\u2014Fagin. Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes. He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still. A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round, he saw that the jurymen had turned together, to consider their verdict. As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay. But in no one face\u2014not even among the women, of whom there were many there\u2014could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all absorbing interest that he should be condemned. As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge. Hush! They only sought permission to retire. He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it. He looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little note book. He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done. In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another. Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold\u2014and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it\u2014and then went on to think again. At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. Perfect stillness ensued\u2014not a rustle\u2014not a breath\u2014Guilty. The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday. The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man\u2014an old man\u2014and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again. The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed. They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison. Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there\u2014alone. He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead\u2014that was the end. To be hanged by the neck till he was dead. As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He had seen some of them die,\u2014and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes! Some of them might have inhabited that very cell\u2014sat upon that very spot. It was very dark; why didn\u2019t they bring a light? The cell had been built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies\u2014the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.\u2014Light, light! At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more. Then came the night\u2014dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad to hear this church clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. To him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound\u2014Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning. The day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as come\u2014and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off. Saturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought of this, the day broke\u2014Sunday. It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had sat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they\u2014used to such sights\u2014recoiled from him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together. He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight\u2014nine\u2014then. If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other\u2019s heels, where would he be, when they came round again! Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven\u2014 Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him. From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness. The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the lodge. \u201cIs the young gentleman to come too, sir?\u201d said the man whose duty it was to conduct them. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sight for children, sir.\u201d \u201cIt is not indeed, my friend,\u201d rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \u201cbut my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well\u2014even at the cost of some pain and fear\u2014that he should see him now.\u201d These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells. \u201cThis,\u201d said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence\u2014\u201cthis is the place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.\u201d He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men\u2019s voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards. They were putting up the scaffold. From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. They did so. The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision. \u201cGood boy, Charley\u2014well done\u2014\u201d he mumbled. \u201cOliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too\u2014quite the gentleman now\u2014quite the\u2014take that boy away to bed!\u201d The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking. \u201cTake him away to bed!\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cDo you hear me, some of you? He has been the\u2014the\u2014somehow the cause of all this. It\u2019s worth the money to bring him up to it\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat, Bill; never mind the girl\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!\u201d \u201cFagin,\u201d said the jailer. \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. \u201cAn old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down. \u201cHere\u2019s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t be one long,\u201d he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror. \u201cStrike them all dead! What right have they to butcher me?\u201d As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there. \u201cSteady,\u201d said the turnkey, still holding him down. \u201cNow, sir, tell him what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.\u201d \u201cYou have some papers,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow advancing, \u201cwhich were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all a lie together,\u201d replied Fagin. \u201cI haven\u2019t one\u2014not one.\u201d \u201cFor the love of God,\u201d said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, \u201cdo not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain. Where are those papers?\u201d \u201cOliver,\u201d cried Fagin, beckoning to him. \u201cHere, here! Let me whisper to you.\u201d \u201cI am not afraid,\u201d said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow\u2019s hand. \u201cThe papers,\u201d said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, \u201care in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front room. I want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d returned Oliver. \u201cLet me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.\u201d \u201cOutside, outside,\u201d replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. \u201cSay I\u2019ve gone to sleep\u2014they\u2019ll believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!\u201d \u201cOh! God forgive this wretched man!\u201d cried the boy with a burst of tears. \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Fagin. \u201cThat\u2019ll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don\u2019t you mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!\u201d \u201cHave you nothing else to ask him, sir?\u201d inquired the turnkey. \u201cNo other question,\u201d replied Mr. Brownlow. \u201cIf I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position\u2014\u201d \u201cNothing will do that, sir,\u201d replied the man, shaking his head. \u201cYou had better leave him.\u201d The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned. \u201cPress on, press on,\u201d cried Fagin. \u201cSoftly, but not so slow. Faster, faster!\u201d The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard. It was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk. Day was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all\u2014the black stage, the cross beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death. CHAPTER LIII. AND LAST The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words. Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman\u2019s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home. Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter in law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know\u2014the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed. It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father\u2019s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded. Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin\u2019s gang. Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver\u2019s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world. Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor\u2019s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity. In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority. Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman\u2019s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour. Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same. Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife. As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last named boy quite grey. They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong. Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes\u2019s crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer\u2019s drudge, and a carrier\u2019s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire. And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures. I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint her the life and joy of the fire side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister\u2019s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech\u2014I would fain recall them every one. How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become\u2014how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing\u2014how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them\u2014these are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained. Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: \u201cAGNES.\u201d There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love\u2014the love beyond the grave\u2014of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring. ",

        "TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.",
        "For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.",
        "Although I am not disposed to maintain that being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred.",
        "The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,\u2014a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.",
        "Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time.",
        "There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them.",
        "The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.",
        "As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, \u201cLet me see the child, and die.\u201d The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.",
        "As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\u2019s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him: \u201cOh, you must not talk about dying yet.\u201d \u201cLor bless her dear heart, no!\u201d interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.",
        "\u201cLor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on \u2019em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she\u2019ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there\u2019s a dear young lamb do.\u201d Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\u2019s prospects failed in producing its due effect.",
        "The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.",
        "The surgeon deposited it in her arms.",
        "She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back\u2014and died.",
        "They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.",
        "They talked of hope and comfort.",
        "They had been strangers too long.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all over, Mrs.",
        "Thingummy!\u201d said the surgeon at last.",
        "\u201cAh, poor dear, so it is!\u201d said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child.",
        "\u201cPoor dear!\u201d \u201cYou needn\u2019t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,\u201d said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s very likely it _will_ be troublesome.",
        "Give it a little gruel if it is.\u201d He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed side on his way to the door, added, \u201cShe was a good looking girl, too; where did she come from?\u201d \u201cShe was brought here last night,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cby the overseer\u2019s order.",
        "She was found lying in the street.",
        "She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.\u201d The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.",
        "\u201cThe old story,\u201d he said, shaking his head: \u201cno wedding ring, I see.",
        "Ah! Good night!\u201d The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.",
        "What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society.",
        "But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once\u2014a parish child\u2014the orphan of a workhouse\u2014the humble, half starved drudge\u2014to be cuffed and buffeted through the world\u2014despised by all, and pitied by none.",
        "Oliver cried lustily.",
        "If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.",
        "CHAPTER II.",
        "TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\u2019S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception.",
        "He was brought up by hand.",
        "The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.",
        "The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in \u201cthe house\u201d who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need.",
        "The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not.",
        "Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \u201cfarmed,\u201d or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence halfpenny per small head per week.",
        "Sevenpence halfpenny\u2019s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable.",
        "The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.",
        "So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them.",
        "Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.",
        "Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four and twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air.",
        "Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.",
        "Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing\u2014though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm\u2014the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance.",
        "But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self devotional.",
        "Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going.",
        "The children were neat and clean to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have! It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.",
        "Oliver Twist\u2019s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference.",
        "But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\u2019s breast.",
        "It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth day at all.",
        "Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs.",
        "Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr.",
        "Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden gate.",
        "\u201cGoodness gracious! Is that you, Mr.",
        "Bumble, sir?\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well affected ecstasies of joy.",
        "\u201c(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \u2019em directly.)\u2014My heart alive! Mr.",
        "Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure ly!\u201d Now, Mr.",
        "Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\u2019s.",
        "\u201cLor, only think,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, running out,\u2014for the three boys had been removed by this time,\u2014\u201conly think of that! That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr.",
        "Bumble, do, sir.\u201d Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.",
        "\u201cDo you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs.",
        "Mann,\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Bumble, grasping his cane, \u201cto keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs.",
        "Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure Mr.",
        "Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Mann with great humility.",
        "Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance.",
        "He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other.",
        "He relaxed.",
        "\u201cWell, well, Mrs.",
        "Mann,\u201d he replied in a calmer tone; \u201cit may be as you say; it may be.",
        "Lead the way in, Mrs.",
        "Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.\u201d Mrs.",
        "Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him.",
        "Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled.",
        "Yes, he smiled.",
        "Beadles are but men: and Mr.",
        "Bumble smiled.",
        "\u201cNow don\u2019t you be offended at what I\u2019m a going to say,\u201d observed Mrs.",
        "Mann, with captivating sweetness.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn\u2019t mention it.",
        "Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr.",
        "Bumble?\u201d \u201cNot a drop.",
        "Nor a drop,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner.",
        "\u201cI think you will,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.",
        "\u201cJust a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble coughed.",
        "\u201cNow, just a leetle drop,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann persuasively.",
        "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d inquired the beadle.",
        "\u201cWhy, it\u2019s what I\u2019m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into the blessed infants\u2019 Daffy, when they ain\u2019t well, Mr.",
        "Bumble,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and glass.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s gin.",
        "I\u2019ll not deceive you, Mr.",
        "It\u2019s gin.\u201d \u201cDo you give the children Daffy, Mrs.",
        "Mann?\u201d inquired Bumble, following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.",
        "\u201cAh, bless \u2019em, that I do, dear as it is,\u201d replied the nurse.",
        "\u201cI couldn\u2019t see \u2019em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.\u201d \u201cNo\u201d; said Mr.",
        "Bumble approvingly; \u201cno, you could not.",
        "You are a humane woman, Mrs.",
        "Mann.\u201d (Here she set down the glass.) \u201cI shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs.",
        "Mann.\u201d (He drew it towards him.) \u201cYou feel as a mother, Mrs.",
        "Mann.\u201d (He stirred the gin and water.) \u201cI\u2014I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs.",
        "Mann\u201d; and he swallowed half of it.",
        "\u201cAnd now about business,\u201d said the beadle, taking out a leathern pocket book.",
        "\u201cThe child that was half baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year old today.\u201d \u201cBless him!\u201d interposed Mrs.",
        "Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron.",
        "\u201cAnd notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards increased to twenty pound.",
        "Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I may say, supernat\u2019ral exertions on the part of this parish,\u201d said Bumble, \u201cwe have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his mother\u2019s settlement, name, or condition.\u201d Mrs.",
        "Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment\u2019s reflection, \u201cHow comes he to have any name at all, then?\u201d The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, \u201cI inwented it.\u201d \u201cYou, Mr.",
        "Bumble!\u201d \u201cI, Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "We name our fondlings in alphabetical order.",
        "The last was a S,\u2014Swubble, I named him.",
        "This was a T,\u2014Twist, I named _him_.",
        "The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins.",
        "I have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again, when we come to Z.\u201d \u201cWhy, you\u2019re quite a literary character, sir!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment; \u201cperhaps I may be.",
        "Perhaps I may be, Mrs.",
        "Mann.\u201d He finished the gin and water, and added, \u201cOliver being now too old to remain here, the board have determined to have him back into the house.",
        "I have come out myself to take him there.",
        "So let me see him at once.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll fetch him directly,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, leaving the room for that purpose.",
        "Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.",
        "\u201cMake a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and the cocked hat on the table.",
        "\u201cWill you go along with me, Oliver?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, in a majestic voice.",
        "Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs.",
        "Mann, who had got behind the beadle\u2019s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance.",
        "He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection.",
        "\u201cWill she go with me?\u201d inquired poor Oliver.",
        "\u201cNo, she can\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cBut she\u2019ll come and see you sometimes.\u201d This was no very great consolation to the child.",
        "Young as he was, however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away.",
        "It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes.",
        "Hunger and recent ill usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.",
        "Mann gave him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and butter, lest he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse.",
        "With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.",
        "Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years.",
        "And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the cottage gate closed after him.",
        "Wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into the child\u2019s heart for the first time.",
        "Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his gold laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were \u201cnearly there.\u201d To these interrogations Mr.",
        "Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary blandness which gin and water awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.",
        "Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread, when Mr.",
        "Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.",
        "Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.",
        "He had no time to think about the matter, however; for Mr.",
        "Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table.",
        "At the top of the table, seated in an arm chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face.",
        "\u201cBow to the board,\u201d said Bumble.",
        "Oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table, fortunately bowed to that.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, boy?\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair.",
        "Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry.",
        "These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.",
        "Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.",
        "\u201cBoy,\u201d said the gentleman in the high chair, \u201clisten to me.",
        "You know you\u2019re an orphan, I suppose?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that, sir?\u201d inquired poor Oliver.",
        "\u201cThe boy _is_ a fool\u2014I thought he was,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d said the gentleman who had spoken first.",
        "\u201cYou know you\u2019ve got no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.",
        "\u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "And to be sure it was very extraordinary.",
        "What _could_ the boy be crying for? \u201cI hope you say your prayers every night,\u201d said another gentleman in a gruff voice; \u201cand pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you\u2014like a Christian.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d stammered the boy.",
        "The gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right.",
        "It would have been very like a Christian, and a marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of _him_.",
        "But he hadn\u2019t, because nobody had taught him.",
        "\u201cWell! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,\u201d said the red faced gentleman in the high chair.",
        "\u201cSo you\u2019ll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six o\u2019clock,\u201d added the surly one in the white waistcoat.",
        "For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed himself to sleep.",
        "What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England! They let the paupers go to sleep! Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes.",
        "But they had.",
        "And this was it: The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered\u2014the poor people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.",
        "\u201cOho!\u201d said the board, looking very knowing; \u201cwe are the fellows to set this to rights; we\u2019ll stop it all, in no time.\u201d So, they established the rule, that all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of it.",
        "With this view, they contracted with the water works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a corn factory to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays.",
        "They made a great many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors\u2019 Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a bachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.",
        "The relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.",
        "For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in full operation.",
        "It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the increase in the undertaker\u2019s bill, and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two\u2019s gruel.",
        "But the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.",
        "The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes.",
        "Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more\u2014except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides.",
        "The bowls never wanted washing.",
        "The boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon.",
        "Boys have generally excellent appetites.",
        "Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn\u2019t been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small cook shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age.",
        "He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed him.",
        "A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver Twist.",
        "The evening arrived; the boys took their places.",
        "The master, in his cook\u2019s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said over the short commons.",
        "The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him.",
        "Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery.",
        "He rose from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity: \u201cPlease, sir, I want some more.\u201d The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale.",
        "He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung for support to the copper.",
        "The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the boys with fear.",
        "\u201cWhat!\u201d said the master at length, in a faint voice.",
        "\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cI want some more.\u201d The master aimed a blow at Oliver\u2019s head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.",
        "The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr.",
        "Bumble rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair, said, \u201cMr.",
        "Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for more!\u201d There was a general start.",
        "Horror was depicted on every countenance.",
        "\u201cFor _more_!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Limbkins.",
        "\u201cCompose yourself, Bumble, and answer me distinctly.",
        "Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\u201d \u201cHe did, sir,\u201d replied Bumble.",
        "\u201cThat boy will be hung,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cI know that boy will be hung.\u201d Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman\u2019s opinion.",
        "An animated discussion took place.",
        "Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the parish.",
        "In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.",
        "\u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning: \u201cI never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am that that boy will come to be hung.\u201d As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no.",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board.",
        "It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual\u2019s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other.",
        "To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals.",
        "There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver\u2019s youth and childishness.",
        "He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.",
        "Let it not be supposed by the enemies of \u201cthe system,\u201d that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation.",
        "As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr.",
        "Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane.",
        "As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example.",
        "And so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.",
        "It chanced one morning, while Oliver\u2019s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr.",
        "Gamfield, chimney sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing.",
        "Gamfield\u2019s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.",
        "\u201cWo\u2014o!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Gamfield to the donkey.",
        "The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.",
        "Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey\u2019s.",
        "Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round.",
        "He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again.",
        "Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.",
        "The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room.",
        "Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr.",
        "Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr.",
        "Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.",
        "Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr.",
        "Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves.",
        "So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cThis here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \u2019prentis,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Gamfield.",
        "\u201cAy, my man,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile.",
        "\u201cWhat of him?\u201d \u201cIf the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good \u2019spectable chimbley sweepin\u2019 bisness,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Gamfield, \u201cI wants a \u2019prentis, and I am ready to take him.\u201d \u201cWalk in,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a nasty trade,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish.",
        "\u201cYoung boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\u201d said another gentleman.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make \u2019em come down again,\u201d said Gamfield; \u201cthat\u2019s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain\u2019t o\u2019 no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that\u2019s wot he likes.",
        "Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\u2019l\u2019men, and there\u2019s nothink like a good hot blaze to make \u2019em come down vith a run.",
        "It\u2019s humane too, gen\u2019l\u2019men, acause, even if they\u2019ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes \u2019em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\u201d The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.",
        "Limbkins.",
        "The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \u201csaving of expenditure,\u201d \u201clooked well in the accounts,\u201d \u201chave a printed report published,\u201d were alone audible.",
        "These only chanced to be heard, indeed, on account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.",
        "At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr.",
        "Limbkins said: \u201cWe have considered your proposition, and we don\u2019t approve of it.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cDecidedly not,\u201d added the other members.",
        "As Mr.",
        "Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings.",
        "It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table.",
        "\u201cSo you won\u2019t let me have him, gen\u2019l\u2019men?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Gamfield, pausing near the door.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Limbkins; \u201cat least, as it\u2019s a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\u201d Mr.",
        "Gamfield\u2019s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said, \u201cWhat\u2019ll you give, gen\u2019l\u2019men? Come! Don\u2019t be too hard on a poor man.",
        "What\u2019ll you give?\u201d \u201cI should say, three pound ten was plenty,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Limbkins.",
        "\u201cTen shillings too much,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cCome!\u201d said Gamfield; \u201csay four pound, gen\u2019l\u2019men.",
        "Say four pound, and you\u2019ve got rid of him for good and all.",
        "There!\u201d \u201cThree pound ten,\u201d repeated Mr.",
        "Limbkins, firmly.",
        "\u201cCome! I\u2019ll split the diff\u2019erence, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d urged Gamfield.",
        "\u201cThree pound fifteen.\u201d \u201cNot a farthing more,\u201d was the firm reply of Mr.",
        "Limbkins.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re desperate hard upon me, gen\u2019l\u2019men,\u201d said Gamfield, wavering.",
        "\u201cPooh! pooh! nonsense!\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium.",
        "Take him, you silly fellow! He\u2019s just the boy for you.",
        "He wants the stick, now and then: it\u2019ll do him good; and his board needn\u2019t come very expensive, for he hasn\u2019t been overfed since he was born.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d Mr.",
        "Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and, observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.",
        "The bargain was made.",
        "Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for signature and approval, that very afternoon.",
        "In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt.",
        "He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance, when Mr.",
        "Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread.",
        "At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a going to be made a \u2019prentice of, Oliver.\u201d \u201cA prentice, sir!\u201d said the child, trembling.",
        "\u201cYes, Oliver,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cThe kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a going to \u201cprentice\u201d you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!\u2014three pound ten, Oliver!\u2014seventy shillins\u2014one hundred and forty sixpences!\u2014and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can\u2019t love.\u201d As Mr.",
        "Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child\u2019s face, and he sobbed bitterly.",
        "\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; \u201cCome, Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don\u2019t cry into your gruel; that\u2019s a very foolish action, Oliver.\u201d It certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.",
        "On their way to the magistrate, Mr.",
        "Bumble instructed Oliver that all he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as Mr.",
        "Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him.",
        "When they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr.",
        "Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him.",
        "There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.",
        "At the expiration of which time Mr.",
        "Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the cocked hat, and said aloud: \u201cNow, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.\u201d As Mr.",
        "Bumble said this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, \u201cMind what I told you, you young rascal!\u201d Oliver stared innocently in Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the door of which was open.",
        "It was a large room, with a great window.",
        "Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of tortoise shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before him.",
        "Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr.",
        "Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three bluff looking men, in top boots, were lounging about.",
        "The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been stationed by Mr.",
        "Bumble in front of the desk.",
        "\u201cThis is the boy, your worship,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the last mentioned old gentleman woke up.",
        "\u201cOh, is this the boy?\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cThis is him, sir,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cBow to the magistrate, my dear.\u201d Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.",
        "He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates\u2019 powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cI suppose he\u2019s fond of chimney sweeping?\u201d \u201cHe doats on it, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn\u2019t.",
        "\u201cAnd he _will_ be a sweep, will he?\u201d inquired the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cIf we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow, he\u2019d run away simultaneous, your worship,\u201d replied Bumble.",
        "\u201cAnd this man that\u2019s to be his master\u2014you, sir\u2014you\u2019ll treat him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhen I says I will, I means I will,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Gamfield doggedly.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open hearted man,\u201d said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for Oliver\u2019s premium, whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.",
        "But the magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn\u2019t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did.",
        "\u201cI hope I am, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Gamfield, with an ugly leer.",
        "\u201cI have no doubt you are, my friend,\u201d replied the old gentleman: fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the inkstand.",
        "It was the critical moment of Oliver\u2019s fate.",
        "If the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway hurried off.",
        "But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even by a half blind magistrate.",
        "The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to Mr.",
        "Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect.",
        "\u201cMy boy!\u201d said the old gentleman, \u201cyou look pale and alarmed.",
        "What is the matter?\u201d \u201cStand a little away from him, Beadle,\u201d said the other magistrate: laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest.",
        "\u201cNow, boy, tell us what\u2019s the matter: don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that they would order him back to the dark room\u2014that they would starve him\u2014beat him\u2014kill him if they pleased\u2014rather than send him away with that dreadful man.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity.",
        "\u201cWell! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare facedest.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Beadle,\u201d said the second old gentleman, when Mr.",
        "Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.",
        "\u201cI beg your worship\u2019s pardon,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, incredulous of having heard aright.",
        "\u201cDid your worship speak to me?\u201d \u201cYes.",
        "Hold your tongue.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.",
        "A beadle ordered to hold his tongue! A moral revolution! The old gentleman in the tortoise shell spectacles looked at his companion, he nodded significantly.",
        "\u201cWe refuse to sanction these indentures,\u201d said the old gentleman: tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.",
        "\u201cI hope,\u201d stammered Mr.",
        "Limbkins: \u201cI hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.\u201d \u201cThe magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter,\u201d said the second old gentleman sharply.",
        "\u201cTake the boy back to the workhouse, and treat him kindly.",
        "He seems to want it.\u201d That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain.",
        "Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto Mr.",
        "Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description.",
        "The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was again to let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him.",
        "CHAPTER IV.",
        "OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea.",
        "The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.",
        "This suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class.",
        "The more the case presented itself to the board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.",
        "Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person than Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.",
        "Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large jointed man, attired in a suit of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and shoes to answer.",
        "His features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity.",
        "His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr.",
        "Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand.",
        "\u201cI have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.",
        "Bumble,\u201d said the undertaker.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry,\u201d said the beadle, as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff box of the undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin.",
        "\u201cI say you\u2019ll make your fortune, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry,\u201d repeated Mr.",
        "Bumble, tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane.",
        "\u201cThink so?\u201d said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event.",
        "\u201cThe prices allowed by the board are very small, Mr.",
        "Bumble.\u201d \u201cSo are the coffins,\u201d replied the beadle: with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.",
        "Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and laughed a long time without cessation.",
        "\u201cWell, well, Mr.",
        "Bumble,\u201d he said at length, \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that, since the new system of feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "Well seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, \u201cevery trade has its drawbacks.",
        "A fair profit is, of course, allowable.\u201d \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cand if I don\u2019t get a profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the long run, you see\u2014he! he! he!\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cThough I must say,\u201d continued the undertaker, resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted: \u201cthough I must say, Mr.",
        "Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest.",
        "The people who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr.",
        "Bumble, that three or four inches over one\u2019s calculation makes a great hole in one\u2019s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.\u201d As Mr.",
        "Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill used man; and as Mr.",
        "Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject.",
        "Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him his theme.",
        "\u201cBy the bye,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, \u201cyou don\u2019t know anybody who wants a boy, do you? A porochial \u2019prentis, who is at present a dead weight; a millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, liberal terms?\u201d As Mr.",
        "Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words \u201cfive pounds\u201d: which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.",
        "\u201cGadso!\u201d said the undertaker: taking Mr.",
        "Bumble by the gilt edged lappel of his official coat; \u201cthat\u2019s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you about.",
        "You know\u2014dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr.",
        "Bumble! I never noticed it before.\u201d \u201cYes, I think it rather pretty,\u201d said the beadle, glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat.",
        "\u201cThe die is the same as the porochial seal\u2014the Good Samaritan healing the sick and bruised man.",
        "The board presented it to me on Newyear\u2019s morning, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.\u201d \u201cI recollect,\u201d said the undertaker.",
        "\u201cThe jury brought it in, \u2018Died from exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\u2019 didn\u2019t they?\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble nodded.",
        "\u201cAnd they made it a special verdict, I think,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cby adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had\u2014\u201d \u201cTush! Foolery!\u201d interposed the beadle.",
        "\u201cIf the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they\u2019d have enough to do.\u201d \u201cVery true,\u201d said the undertaker; \u201cthey would indeed.\u201d \u201cJuries,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when working into a passion: \u201cjuries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling wretches.\u201d \u201cSo they are,\u201d said the undertaker.",
        "\u201cThey haven\u2019t no more philosophy nor political economy about \u2019em than that,\u201d said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.",
        "\u201cNo more they have,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker.",
        "\u201cI despise \u2019em,\u201d said the beadle, growing very red in the face.",
        "\u201cSo do I,\u201d rejoined the undertaker.",
        "\u201cAnd I only wish we\u2019d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a week or two,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cthe rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for \u2019em.\u201d \u201cLet \u2019em alone for that,\u201d replied the undertaker.",
        "So saying, he smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.",
        "Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker, said in a calmer voice: \u201cWell; what about the boy?\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d replied the undertaker; \u201cwhy, you know, Mr.",
        "Bumble, I pay a good deal towards the poor\u2019s rates.\u201d \u201cHem!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWell?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d replied the undertaker, \u201cI was thinking that if I pay so much towards \u2019em, I\u2019ve a right to get as much out of \u2019em as I can, Mr.",
        "Bumble; and so\u2014I think I\u2019ll take the boy myself.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the building.",
        "Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening \u201cupon liking\u201d\u2014a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to do what he likes with.",
        "When little Oliver was taken before \u201cthe gentlemen\u201d that evening; and informed that he was to go, that night, as general house lad to a coffin maker\u2019s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and ordered Mr.",
        "Bumble to remove him forthwith.",
        "Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were rather out, in this particular instance.",
        "The simple fact was, that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.",
        "He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage put into his hand\u2014which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep\u2014he pulled his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.",
        "For some time, Mr.",
        "Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee breeches.",
        "As they drew near to their destination, however, Mr.",
        "Bumble thought it expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage.",
        "\u201cOliver!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.",
        "\u201cPull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.\u201d Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor.",
        "As Mr.",
        "Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it rolled down his cheek.",
        "It was followed by another, and another.",
        "The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.",
        "Withdrawing his other hand from Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s he covered his face with both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity.",
        "\u201cWell! Of _all_ the ungratefullest, and worst disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, sir,\u201d sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the well known cane; \u201cno, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so\u2014so\u2014\u201d \u201cSo what?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Bumble in amazement.",
        "\u201cSo lonely, sir! So very lonely!\u201d cried the child.",
        "\u201cEverybody hates me.",
        "Oh! sir, don\u2019t, don\u2019t pray be cross to me!\u201d The child beat his hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion\u2019s face, with tears of real agony.",
        "Bumble regarded Oliver\u2019s piteous and helpless look, with some astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky manner; and after muttering something about \u201cthat troublesome cough,\u201d bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy.",
        "Then once more taking his hand, he walked on with him in silence.",
        "The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making some entries in his day book by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle, when Mr.",
        "Bumble entered.",
        "\u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the middle of a word; \u201cis that you, Bumble?\u201d \u201cNo one else, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry,\u201d replied the beadle.",
        "\u201cHere! I\u2019ve brought the boy.\u201d Oliver made a bow.",
        "\u201cOh! that\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said the undertaker: raising the candle above his head, to get a better view of Oliver.",
        "\u201cMrs.",
        "Sowerberry, will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?\u201d Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented the form of a short, thin, squeezed up woman, with a vixenish countenance.",
        "\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, deferentially, \u201cthis is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.\u201d Oliver bowed again.",
        "\u201cDear me!\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, \u201che\u2019s very small.\u201d \u201cWhy, he _is_ rather small,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble: looking at Oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger; \u201che is small.",
        "There\u2019s no denying it.",
        "But he\u2019ll grow, Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry\u2014he\u2019ll grow.\u201d \u201cAh! I dare say he will,\u201d replied the lady pettishly, \u201con our victuals and our drink.",
        "I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost more to keep, than they\u2019re worth.",
        "However, men always think they know best.",
        "There! Get downstairs, little bag o\u2019 bones.\u201d With this, the undertaker\u2019s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante room to the coal cellar, and denominated \u201ckitchen\u201d; wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair.",
        "\u201cHere, Charlotte,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down, \u201cgive this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.",
        "He hasn\u2019t come home since the morning, so he may go without \u2019em.",
        "I dare say the boy isn\u2019t too dainty to eat \u2019em\u2014are you, boy?\u201d Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.",
        "I wish some well fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.",
        "I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.",
        "There is only one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker\u2019s wife, when Oliver had finished his supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his future appetite: \u201chave you done?\u201d There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the affirmative.",
        "\u201cThen come with me,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp, and leading the way upstairs; \u201cyour bed\u2019s under the counter.",
        "You don\u2019t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn\u2019t much matter whether you do or don\u2019t, for you can\u2019t sleep anywhere else.",
        "Come; don\u2019t keep me here all night!\u201d Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.",
        "CHAPTER V.",
        "OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES.",
        "GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER\u2019S BUSINESS Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker\u2019s shop, set the lamp down on a workman\u2019s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand.",
        "An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.",
        "Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.",
        "Coffin plates, elm chips, bright headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance.",
        "The shop was close and hot.",
        "The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.",
        "The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.",
        "Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.",
        "He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation.",
        "The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him.",
        "The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well remembered face sank heavily into his heart.",
        "But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.",
        "Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty five times.",
        "When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.",
        "\u201cOpen the door, will yer?\u201d cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door.",
        "\u201cI will, directly, sir,\u201d replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key.",
        "\u201cI suppose yer the new boy, ain\u2019t yer?\u201d said the voice through the key hole.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cHow old are yer?\u201d inquired the voice.",
        "\u201cTen, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cThen I\u2019ll whop yer when I get in,\u201d said the voice; \u201cyou just see if I don\u2019t, that\u2019s all, my work\u2019us brat!\u201d and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.",
        "Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably.",
        "He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.",
        "For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.",
        "\u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; \u201cdid you knock?\u201d \u201cI kicked,\u201d replied the charity boy.",
        "\u201cDid you want a coffin, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver, innocently.",
        "At this, the charity boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way.",
        "\u201cYer don\u2019t know who I am, I suppose, Work\u2019us?\u201d said the charity boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity.",
        "\u201cNo, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m Mister Noah Claypole,\u201d said the charity boy, \u201cand you\u2019re under me.",
        "Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!\u201d With this, Mr.",
        "Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit.",
        "It is difficult for a large headed, small eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.",
        "Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that \u201che\u2019d catch it,\u201d condescended to help him.",
        "Sowerberry came down soon after.",
        "Shortly afterwards, Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry appeared.",
        "Oliver having \u201ccaught it,\u201d in fulfilment of Noah\u2019s prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.",
        "\u201cCome near the fire, Noah,\u201d said Charlotte.",
        "\u201cI saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master\u2019s breakfast.",
        "Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah\u2019s back, and take them bits that I\u2019ve put out on the cover of the bread pan.",
        "There\u2019s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they\u2019ll want you to mind the shop.",
        "D\u2019ye hear?\u201d \u201cD\u2019ye hear, Work\u2019us?\u201d said Noah Claypole.",
        "\u201cLor, Noah!\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cwhat a rum creature you are! Why don\u2019t you let the boy alone?\u201d \u201cLet him alone!\u201d said Noah.",
        "\u201cWhy everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that.",
        "Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him.",
        "All his relations let him have his own way pretty well.",
        "Eh, Charlotte? He! he! he!\u201d \u201cOh, you queer soul!\u201d said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.",
        "Noah was a charity boy, but not a workhouse orphan.",
        "No chance child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.",
        "The shop boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of \u201cleathers,\u201d \u201ccharity,\u201d and the like; and Noah had borne them without reply.",
        "But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest.",
        "This affords charming food for contemplation.",
        "It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity boy.",
        "Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker\u2019s some three weeks or a month.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry\u2014the shop being shut up\u2014were taking their supper in the little back parlour, when Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said, \u201cMy dear\u2014\u201d He was going to say more; but, Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry looking up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry, sharply.",
        "\u201cNothing, my dear, nothing,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cUgh, you brute!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cNot at all, my dear,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry humbly.",
        "\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear, my dear.",
        "I was only going to say\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me what you were going to say,\u201d interposed Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cI am nobody; don\u2019t consult me, pray.",
        "_I_ don\u2019t want to intrude upon your secrets.\u201d As Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry said this, she gave an hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.",
        "\u201cBut, my dear,\u201d said Sowerberry, \u201cI want to ask your advice.\u201d \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t ask mine,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry, in an affecting manner: \u201cask somebody else\u2019s.\u201d Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which frightened Mr.",
        "Sowerberry very much.",
        "This is a very common and much approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very effective.",
        "It at once reduced Mr.",
        "Sowerberry to begging, as a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry was most curious to hear.",
        "After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s only about young Twist, my dear,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cA very good looking boy, that, my dear.\u201d \u201cHe need be, for he eats enough,\u201d observed the lady.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,\u201d resumed Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, \u201cwhich is very interesting.",
        "He would make a delightful mute, my love.\u201d Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment.",
        "Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation on the good lady\u2019s part, proceeded.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t mean a regular mute to attend grown up people, my dear, but only for children\u2019s practice.",
        "It would be very new to have a mute in proportion, my dear.",
        "You may depend upon it, it would have a superb effect.\u201d Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances, she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husband\u2019s mind before? Mr.",
        "Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required.",
        "The occasion was not long in coming.",
        "Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr.",
        "Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket book: from which he selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cAha!\u201d said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance; \u201can order for a coffin, eh?\u201d \u201cFor a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket book: which, like himself, was very corpulent.",
        "\u201cBayton,\u201d said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cI never heard the name before.\u201d Bumble shook his head, as he replied, \u201cObstinate people, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry; very obstinate.",
        "Proud, too, I\u2019m afraid, sir.\u201d \u201cProud, eh?\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Sowerberry with a sneer.",
        "\u201cCome, that\u2019s too much.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s sickening,\u201d replied the beadle.",
        "\u201cAntimonial, Mr.",
        "Sowerberry!\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced the undertaker.",
        "\u201cWe only heard of the family the night before last,\u201d said the beadle; \u201cand we shouldn\u2019t have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad.",
        "He had gone out to dinner; but his \u2019prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent \u2019em some medicine in a blacking bottle, offhand.\u201d \u201cAh, there\u2019s promptness,\u201d said the undertaker.",
        "\u201cPromptness, indeed!\u201d replied the beadle.",
        "\u201cBut what\u2019s the consequence; what\u2019s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband sends back word that the medicine won\u2019t suit his wife\u2019s complaint, and so she shan\u2019t take it\u2014says she shan\u2019t take it, sir! Good, strong, wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers and a coal heaver, only a week before\u2014sent \u2019em for nothing, with a blackin\u2019 bottle in,\u2014and he sends back word that she shan\u2019t take it, sir!\u201d As the atrocity presented itself to Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s mind in full force, he struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with indignation.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cI ne\u2014ver\u2014did\u2014\u201d \u201cNever did, sir!\u201d ejaculated the beadle.",
        "\u201cNo, nor nobody never did; but now she\u2019s dead, we\u2019ve got to bury her; and that\u2019s the direction; and the sooner it\u2019s done, the better.\u201d Thus saying, Mr.",
        "Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.",
        "\u201cWhy, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s voice.",
        "He needn\u2019t have taken the trouble to shrink from Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s glance, however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sowerberry, taking up his hat, \u201cthe sooner this job is done, the better.",
        "Noah, look after the shop.",
        "Oliver, put on your cap, and come with me.\u201d Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional mission.",
        "They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look for the house which was the object of their search.",
        "The houses on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled, occasionally skulked along.",
        "A great many of the tenements had shop fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.",
        "Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body.",
        "The kennel was stagnant and filthy.",
        "The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were hideous with famine.",
        "There was neither knocker nor bell handle at the open door where Oliver and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid, the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.",
        "Stumbling against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.",
        "It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.",
        "The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed.",
        "He stepped in; Oliver followed him.",
        "There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over the empty stove.",
        "An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth, and was sitting beside him.",
        "There were some ragged children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.",
        "Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse.",
        "The man\u2019s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly; his eyes were bloodshot.",
        "The old woman\u2019s face was wrinkled; her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and piercing.",
        "Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man.",
        "They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.",
        "\u201cNobody shall go near her,\u201d said the man, starting fiercely up, as the undertaker approached the recess.",
        "\u201cKeep back! Damn you, keep back, if you\u2019ve a life to lose!\u201d \u201cNonsense, my good man,\u201d said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes.",
        "\u201cNonsense!\u201d \u201cI tell you,\u201d said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on the floor,\u2014\u201cI tell you I won\u2019t have her put into the ground.",
        "She couldn\u2019t rest there.",
        "The worms would worry her\u2014not eat her\u2014she is so worn away.\u201d The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman; \u201ckneel down, kneel down\u2014kneel round her, every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death.",
        "I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her bones were starting through the skin.",
        "There was neither fire nor candle; she died in the dark\u2014in the dark! She couldn\u2019t even see her children\u2019s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names.",
        "I begged for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison.",
        "When I came back, she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved her to death.",
        "I swear it before the God that saw it! They starved her!\u201d He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips.",
        "The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed, menaced them into silence.",
        "Having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the undertaker.",
        "\u201cShe was my daughter,\u201d said the old woman, nodding her head in the direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place.",
        "\u201cLord, Lord! Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! Lord, Lord!\u2014to think of it; it\u2019s as good as a play\u2014as good as a play!\u201d As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment, the undertaker turned to go away.",
        "\u201cStop, stop!\u201d said the old woman in a loud whisper.",
        "\u201cWill she be buried tomorrow, or next day, or tonight? I laid her out; and I must walk, you know.",
        "Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold.",
        "We should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some bread\u2014only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.",
        "Shall we have some bread, dear?\u201d she said eagerly: catching at the undertaker\u2019s coat, as he once more moved towards the door.",
        "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the undertaker, \u201cof course.",
        "Anything you like!\u201d He disengaged himself from the old woman\u2019s grasp; and, drawing Oliver after him, hurried away.",
        "The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a half quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr.",
        "Bumble himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr.",
        "Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse, who were to act as bearers.",
        "An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the street.",
        "\u201cNow, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!\u201d whispered Sowerberry in the old woman\u2019s ear; \u201cwe are rather late; and it won\u2019t do, to keep the clergyman waiting.",
        "Move on, my men,\u2014as quick as you like!\u201d Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the two mourners kept as near them, as they could.",
        "Bumble and Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so long as his master\u2019s, ran by the side.",
        "There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr.",
        "Sowerberry had anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so, before he came.",
        "So, they put the bier on the brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide and seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.",
        "Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper.",
        "At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr.",
        "Bumble, and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.",
        "Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as he came along.",
        "Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.",
        "\u201cNow, Bill!\u201d said Sowerberry to the grave digger.",
        "\u201cFill up!\u201d It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.",
        "The grave digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.",
        "\u201cCome, my good fellow!\u201d said Bumble, tapping the man on the back.",
        "\u201cThey want to shut up the yard.\u201d The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon.",
        "The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their different ways.",
        "\u201cWell, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry, as they walked home, \u201chow do you like it?\u201d \u201cPretty well, thank you, sir\u201d replied Oliver, with considerable hesitation.",
        "\u201cNot very much, sir.\u201d \u201cAh, you\u2019ll get used to it in time, Oliver,\u201d said Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cNothing when you _are_ used to it, my boy.\u201d Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to get Mr.",
        "Sowerberry used to it.",
        "But he thought it better not to ask the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and heard.",
        "CHAPTER VI.",
        "OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM The month\u2019s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.",
        "It was a nice sickly season just at this time.",
        "In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience.",
        "The success of Mr.",
        "Sowerberry\u2019s ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes.",
        "The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town.",
        "As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong minded people bear their trials and losses.",
        "For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be\u2014quite cheerful and contented\u2014conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.",
        "Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness.",
        "Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible.",
        "It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea drinking was over.",
        "All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.",
        "That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hat band, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin cap and leathers.",
        "Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr.",
        "Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.",
        "And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver\u2019s history; for I have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings.",
        "One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton\u2014a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck; when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.",
        "Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table cloth; and pulled Oliver\u2019s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a \u201csneak\u201d; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill conditioned charity boy as he was.",
        "But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny.",

        "_Your_ mother, too! She was a nice \u2019un, she was.",
        "Oh, Lor!\u201d And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion.",
        "\u201cYer know, Work\u2019us,\u201d continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver\u2019s silence, and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most annoying: \u201cYer know, Work\u2019us, it can\u2019t be helped now; and of course yer couldn\u2019t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I\u2019m sure we all are, and pity yer very much.",
        "But yer must know, Work\u2019us, yer mother was a regular right down bad \u2019un.\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.",

        "A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him.",
        "But his spirit was roused at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.",

        "Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a side door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to come further down.",
        "\u201cOh, you little wretch!\u201d screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training.",
        "\u201cOh, you little un grate ful, mur de rous, hor rid villain!\u201d And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of society.",

        "\u201cOh! Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!\u201d \u201cAh! mercy indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d was the reply.",

        "Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along.",
        "It\u2019ll keep the swelling down.\u201d Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a charity boy tearing through the streets pell mell, with no cap on his head, and a clasp knife at his eye.",
        "CHAPTER VII.",
        "OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse gate.",
        "Having rested here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in astonishment.",
        "\u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter with the boy!\u201d said the old pauper.",
        "Bumble! Mr.",
        "Bumble!\u201d cried Noah, with well affected dismay, and in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.",
        "Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,\u2014which is a very curious and remarkable circumstance, as showing that even a beadle, acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of self possession, and forgetfulness of personal dignity.",
        "\u201cOh, Mr.",
        "Bumble, sir!\u201d said Noah: \u201cOliver, sir,\u2014Oliver has\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat? What?\u201d interposed Mr.",
        "Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes.",
        "\u201cNot run away; he hasn\u2019t run away, has he, Noah?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, no.",
        "Not run away, sir, but he\u2019s turned wicious,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cHe tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and then missis.",
        "Oh! what dreadful pain it is! Such agony, please, sir!\u201d And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eel like positions; thereby giving Mr.",
        "Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.",
        "When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed Mr.",
        "Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.",
        "The gentleman\u2019s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young cur was howling for, and why Mr.",
        "Bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an involuntary process? \u201cIt\u2019s a poor boy from the free school, sir,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, \u201cwho has been nearly murdered\u2014all but murdered, sir,\u2014by young Twist.\u201d \u201cBy Jove!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short.",
        "\u201cI knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!\u201d \u201cHe has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.",
        "\u201cAnd his missis,\u201d interposed Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cAnd his master, too, I think you said, Noah?\u201d added Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cNo! he\u2019s out, or he would have murdered him,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cHe said he wanted to.\u201d \u201cAh! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?\u201d inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cAnd please, sir, missis wants to know whether Mr.",
        "Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him\u2014\u2019cause master\u2019s out.\u201d \u201cCertainly, my boy; certainly,\u201d said the gentleman in the white waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah\u2019s head, which was about three inches higher than his own.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a good boy\u2014a very good boy.",
        "Here\u2019s a penny for you.",

        "Don\u2019t spare him, Bumble.\u201d \u201cNo, I will not, sir,\u201d replied the beadle.",
        "And the cocked hat and cane having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner\u2019s satisfaction, Mr.",
        "Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertaker\u2019s shop.",
        "Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.",
        "Sowerberry had not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at the cellar door.",
        "The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.",
        "Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.",
        "With this view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone: \u201cOliver!\u201d \u201cCome; you let me out!\u201d replied Oliver, from the inside.",
        "\u201cDo you know this here voice, Oliver?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cAin\u2019t you afraid of it, sir? Ain\u2019t you a trembling while I speak, sir?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cNo!\u201d replied Oliver, boldly.",
        "An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr.",
        "Bumble not a little.",
        "He stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one to another of the three by standers, in mute astonishment.",
        "\u201cOh, you know, Mr.",
        "Bumble, he must be mad,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cNo boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not madness, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, after a few moments of deep meditation.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s meat.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d exclaimed Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cMeat, ma\u2019am, meat,\u201d replied Bumble, with stern emphasis.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve overfed him, ma\u2019am.",
        "You\u2019ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma\u2019am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you.",
        "What have paupers to do with soul or spirit? It\u2019s quite enough that we let \u2019em have live bodies.",
        "If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma\u2019am, this would never have happened.\u201d \u201cDear, dear!\u201d ejaculated Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling: \u201cthis comes of being liberal!\u201d The liberality of Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self devotion in her voluntarily remaining under Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s heavy accusation, of which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again; \u201cthe only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he\u2019s a little starved down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship.",
        "He comes of a bad family.",
        "Excitable natures, Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed any well disposed woman, weeks before.\u201d At this point of Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.",
        "Sowerberry returned at this juncture.",
        "Oliver\u2019s offence having been explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar door in a twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.",
        "Oliver\u2019s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.",
        "The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.",
        "\u201cNow, you are a nice young fellow, ain\u2019t you?\u201d said Sowerberry; giving Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.",
        "\u201cHe called my mother names,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cWell, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cShe deserved what he said, and worse.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cShe did,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d said Oliver.",
        "Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.",
        "This flood of tears left Mr.",
        "Sowerberry no alternative.",
        "If he had hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter.",
        "To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went\u2014it was not very extensive\u2014kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked him.",
        "The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.",
        "For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.",
        "It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings which the day\u2019s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child.",
        "He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had roasted him alive.",
        "But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him! For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude.",
        "The candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet.",
        "Having gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.",
        "It was a cold, dark night.",
        "The stars seemed, to the boy\u2019s eyes, farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral and death like, from being so still.",
        "He softly reclosed the door.",
        "Having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.",
        "With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.",
        "One timid look around\u2014one moment\u2019s pause of hesitation\u2014he had closed it behind him, and was in the open street.",
        "He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.",
        "He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill.",
        "He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the fields, which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.",
        "Along this same footpath, Oliver well remembered he had trotted beside Mr.",
        "Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.",
        "His way lay directly in front of the cottage.",
        "His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.",
        "He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so.",
        "Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen; so he walked on.",
        "He reached the house.",
        "There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour.",
        "Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.",
        "A child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions.",
        "Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been his little friend and playmate.",
        "They had been beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.",
        "\u201cHush, Dick!\u201d said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him.",
        "\u201cIs any one up?\u201d \u201cNobody but me,\u201d replied the child.",
        "\u201cYou musn\u2019t say you saw me, Dick,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cI am running away.",
        "They beat and ill use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long way off.",
        "I don\u2019t know where.",
        "How pale you are!\u201d \u201cI heard the doctor tell them I was dying,\u201d replied the child with a faint smile.",
        "\u201cI am very glad to see you, dear; but don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, I will, to say good b\u2019ye to you,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cI shall see you again, Dick.",
        "I know I shall! You will be well and happy!\u201d \u201cI hope so,\u201d replied the child.",
        "\u201cAfter I am dead, but not before.",
        "I know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.",
        "Kiss me,\u201d said the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round Oliver\u2019s neck.",
        "\u201cGood b\u2019ye, dear! God bless you!\u201d The blessing was from a young child\u2019s lips, but it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once forgot it.",

        "It was eight o\u2019clock now.",
        "Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon, fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken.",
        "Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.",
        "The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London.",

        "Bumble\u2014could ever find him there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of.",
        "It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him.",
        "As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.",
        "He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination.",
        "As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there.",
        "He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle.",
        "He had a penny too\u2014a gift of Sowerberry\u2019s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well\u2014in his pocket.",
        "\u201cA clean shirt,\u201d thought Oliver, \u201cis a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty five miles\u2019 walk in winter time.\u201d But Oliver\u2019s thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.",
        "Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage doors by the road side.",
        "When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay rick, determined to lie there, till morning.",
        "He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields, and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before.",
        "Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.",
        "He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed.",
        "He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again.",
        "His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him.",
        "Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along.",
        "He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny.",
        "Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.",
        "When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn\u2019t deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.",
        "In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail.",
        "This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition.",
        "In others, he would stand about the inn yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady\u2019s ordering one of the post boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something.",
        "If he begged at a farmer\u2019s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle\u2014which brought Oliver\u2019s heart into his mouth,\u2014very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.",
        "In fact, if it had not been for a good hearted turnpike man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver\u2019s troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother\u2019s; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king\u2019s highway.",
        "But the turnpike man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford\u2014and more\u2014with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver\u2019s soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.",
        "Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet.",
        "The window shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day.",
        "The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door step.",
        "By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro.",
        "Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there.",
        "He had no heart to beg.",
        "And there he sat.",
        "He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way.",
        "He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.",
        "Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said, \u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen.",
        "He was a snub nosed, flat browed, common faced boy enough; and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man.",
        "He was short of his age: with rather bow legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes.",
        "His hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment\u2014and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old place again.",
        "He wore a man\u2019s coat, which reached nearly to his heels.",
        "He had turned the cuffs back, half way up his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them.",
        "He was, altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers.",
        "\u201cHullo, my covey! What\u2019s the row?\u201d said this strange young gentleman to Oliver.",
        "\u201cI am very hungry and tired,\u201d replied Oliver: the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke.",
        "\u201cI have walked a long way.",
        "I have been walking these seven days.\u201d \u201cWalking for sivin days!\u201d said the young gentleman.",
        "\u201cOh, I see.",
        "Beak\u2019s order, eh? But,\u201d he added, noticing Oliver\u2019s look of surprise, \u201cI suppose you don\u2019t know what a beak is, my flash com pan i on.\u201d Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird\u2019s mouth described by the term in question.",
        "\u201cMy eyes, how green!\u201d exclaimed the young gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhy, a beak\u2019s a madgst\u2019rate; and when you walk by a beak\u2019s order, it\u2019s not straight forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin.",
        "Was you never on the mill?\u201d \u201cWhat mill?\u201d inquired Oliver.",
        "\u201cWhat mill! Why, _the_ mill\u2014the mill as takes up so little room that it\u2019ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind\u2019s low with people, than when it\u2019s high; acos then they can\u2019t get workmen.",
        "But come,\u201d said the young gentleman; \u201cyou want grub, and you shall have it.",
        "I\u2019m at low water mark myself\u2014only one bob and a magpie; but, as far as it goes, I\u2019ll fork out and stump.",
        "Up with you on your pins.",
        "There! Now then! Morrice!\u201d Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandler\u2019s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready dressed ham and a half quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, \u201ca fourpenny bran!\u201d the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein.",
        "Taking the bread under his arm, the young gentleman turned into a small public house, and led the way to a tap room in the rear of the premises.",
        "Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new friend\u2019s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention.",
        "\u201cGoing to London?\u201d said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length concluded.",
        "\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cGot any lodgings?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cMoney?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the big coat sleeves would let them go.",
        "\u201cDo you live in London?\u201d inquired Oliver.",
        "\u201cYes.",
        "I do, when I\u2019m at home,\u201d replied the boy.",
        "\u201cI suppose you want some place to sleep in tonight, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cI do, indeed,\u201d answered Oliver.",
        "\u201cI have not slept under a roof since I left the country.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fret your eyelids on that score,\u201d said the young gentleman.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve got to be in London tonight; and I know a \u2019spectable old gentleman as lives there, wot\u2019ll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the change\u2014that is, if any gentleman he knows interduces you.",
        "And don\u2019t he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means.",
        "Certainly not!\u201d The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so.",
        "This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted; especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a comfortable place, without loss of time.",
        "This led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend\u2019s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and _prot\u00e9g\u00e9_ of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.",
        "Dawkins\u2019s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patron\u2019s interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the _sobriquet_ of \u201cThe Artful Dodger,\u201d Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him.",
        "Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.",
        "As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven o\u2019clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.",
        "They crossed from the Angel into St.",
        "John\u2019s Road; struck down the small street which terminates at Sadler\u2019s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley in the Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.",
        "Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way, as he passed along.",
        "A dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen.",
        "The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated with filthy odours.",
        "There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside.",
        "The sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the public houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with might and main.",
        "Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the door ways, great ill looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well disposed or harmless errands.",
        "Oliver was just considering whether he hadn\u2019t better run away, when they reached the bottom of the hill.",
        "His conductor, catching him by the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the passage, closed it behind them.",
        "\u201cNow, then!\u201d cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the Dodger.",
        "\u201cPlummy and slam!\u201d was the reply.",
        "This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage; and a man\u2019s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s two on you,\u201d said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and shielding his eyes with his hand.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s the t\u2019other one?\u201d \u201cA new pal,\u201d replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.",
        "\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d \u201cGreenland.",
        "Is Fagin upstairs?\u201d \u201cYes, he\u2019s a sortin\u2019 the wipes.",
        "Up with you!\u201d The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared.",
        "Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them.",
        "He threw open the door of a back room, and drew Oliver in after him.",
        "The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt.",
        "There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in a ginger beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a plate.",
        "In a frying pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair.",
        "He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying pan and the clothes horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.",
        "Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor.",
        "Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle aged men.",
        "These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.",
        "So did the Jew himself, toasting fork in hand.",
        "\u201cThis is him, Fagin,\u201d said Jack Dawkins; \u201cmy friend Oliver Twist.\u201d The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.",
        "Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook both his hands very hard\u2014especially the one in which he held his little bundle.",
        "One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed.",
        "These civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew\u2019s toasting fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them.",
        "\u201cWe are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cDodger, take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.",
        "Ah, you\u2019re a staring at the pocket handkerchiefs! eh, my dear? There are a good many of \u2019em, ain\u2019t there? We\u2019ve just looked \u2019em out, ready for the wash; that\u2019s all, Oliver; that\u2019s all.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman.",
        "In the midst of which they went to supper.",
        "Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot gin and water, telling him he must drink it off directly, because another gentleman wanted the tumbler.",
        "Oliver did as he was desired.",
        "Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.",
        "CHAPTER IX.",
        "CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.",
        "There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon.",
        "He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.",
        "Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake.",
        "There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness.",
        "At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.",
        "Oliver was precisely in this condition.",
        "He saw the Jew with his half closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan\u2019s sides: and yet the self same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known.",
        "When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.",
        "Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name.",
        "He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.",
        "After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened.",
        "He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table.",
        "His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.",
        "Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.",
        "\u201cAha!\u201d said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin.",
        "\u201cClever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the last! Never told the old parson where they were.",
        "Never poached upon old Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn\u2019t have loosened the knot, or kept the drop up, a minute longer.",
        "No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!\u201d With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety.",
        "At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.",
        "Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand.",
        "There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly.",
        "At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered: \u201cWhat a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead men never bring awkward stories to light.",
        "Ah, it\u2019s a fine thing for the trade! Five of \u2019em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white livered!\u201d As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver\u2019s face; the boy\u2019s eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant\u2014for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived\u2014it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.",
        "He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up.",
        "He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cWhat do you watch me for? Why are you awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick\u2014quick! for your life.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to sleep any longer, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, meekly.",
        "\u201cI am very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.\u201d \u201cYou were not awake an hour ago?\u201d said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the boy.",
        "\u201cNo! No, indeed!\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cAre you sure?\u201d cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and a threatening attitude.",
        "\u201cUpon my word I was not, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, earnestly.",
        "\u201cI was not, indeed, sir.\u201d \u201cTush, tush, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport.",
        "\u201cOf course I know that, my dear.",
        "I only tried to frighten you.",
        "You\u2019re a brave boy.",
        "Ha! ha! you\u2019re a brave boy, Oliver.\u201d The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.",
        "\u201cDid you see any of these pretty things, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after a short pause.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning rather pale.",
        "\u201cThey\u2014they\u2019re mine, Oliver; my little property.",
        "All I have to live upon, in my old age.",
        "The folks call me a miser, my dear.",
        "Only a miser; that\u2019s all.\u201d Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.",
        "\u201cCertainly, my dear, certainly,\u201d replied the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cStay.",
        "There\u2019s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door.",
        "Bring it here; and I\u2019ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.\u201d Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher.",
        "When he turned his head, the box was gone.",
        "He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew\u2019s directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates.",
        "The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to the Dodger, \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been at work this morning, my dears?\u201d \u201cHard,\u201d replied the Dodger.",
        "\u201cAs nails,\u201d added Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cGood boys, good boys!\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cWhat have you got, Dodger?\u201d \u201cA couple of pocket books,\u201d replied that young gentleman.",
        "\u201cLined?\u201d inquired the Jew, with eagerness.",
        "\u201cPretty well,\u201d replied the Dodger, producing two pocket books; one green, and the other red.",
        "\u201cNot so heavy as they might be,\u201d said the Jew, after looking at the insides carefully; \u201cbut very neat and nicely made.",
        "Ingenious workman, ain\u2019t he, Oliver?\u201d \u201cVery indeed, sir,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "At which Mr.",
        "Charles Bates laughed uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to laugh at, in anything that had passed.",
        "\u201cAnd what have you got, my dear?\u201d said Fagin to Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cWipes,\u201d replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four pocket handkerchiefs.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the Jew, inspecting them closely; \u201cthey\u2019re very good ones, very.",
        "You haven\u2019t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be picked out with a needle, and we\u2019ll teach Oliver how to do it.",
        "Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d \u201cIf you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019d like to be able to make pocket handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cVery much, indeed, if you\u2019ll teach me, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation.",
        "\u201cHe is so jolly green!\u201d said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour.",
        "The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver\u2019s hair over his eyes, and said he\u2019d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing Oliver\u2019s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious.",
        "When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentleman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way.",
        "The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff box in one pocket of his trousers, a note case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day.",
        "Sometimes he stopped at the fire place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop windows.",
        "At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn\u2019t lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.",
        "All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions.",
        "At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff box, note case, watch guard, chain, shirt pin, pocket handkerchief, even the spectacle case.",
        "If the old gentleman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.",
        "When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and the other Nancy.",
        "They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.",
        "They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty.",
        "Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed, as there is no doubt they were.",
        "The visitors stopped a long time.",
        "Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn.",
        "At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.",
        "This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend.",
        "\u201cThere, my dear,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s a pleasant life, isn\u2019t it? They have gone out for the day.\u201d \u201cHave they done work, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthat is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won\u2019t neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it.",
        "Make \u2019em your models, my dear.",
        "Make \u2019em your models,\u201d tapping the fire shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; \u201cdo everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters\u2014especially the Dodger\u2019s, my dear.",
        "He\u2019ll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.\u2014Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, stopping short.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cSee if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do, when we were at play this morning.\u201d Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other.",
        "\u201cIs it gone?\u201d cried the Jew.",
        "\u201cHere it is, sir,\u201d said Oliver, showing it in his hand.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a clever boy, my dear,\u201d said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly.",
        "\u201cI never saw a sharper lad.",
        "Here\u2019s a shilling for you.",
        "If you go on, in this way, you\u2019ll be the greatest man of the time.",
        "And now come here, and I\u2019ll show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs.\u201d Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman\u2019s pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man.",
        "But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.",
        "CHAPTER X.",
        "OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE.",
        "BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew\u2019s room, picking the marks out of the pocket handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.",
        "At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.",
        "Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman\u2019s character.",
        "Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed.",
        "On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.",
        "At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought.",
        "There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre.",
        "Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman\u2019s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.",
        "The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first.",
        "The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.",
        "The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.",
        "These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.",
        "They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, \u201cThe Green\u201d: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d demanded Oliver.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d replied the Dodger.",
        "\u201cDo you see that old cove at the book stall?\u201d \u201cThe old gentleman over the way?\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cYes, I see him.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said the Dodger.",
        "\u201cA prime plant,\u201d observed Master Charley Bates.",
        "Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed.",
        "Oliver walked a few paces after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.",
        "The old gentleman was a very respectable looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles.",
        "He was dressed in a bottle green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm.",
        "He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow chair, in his own study.",
        "It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.",
        "What was Oliver\u2019s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman\u2019s pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed! In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy\u2019s mind.",
        "He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.",
        "This was all done in a minute\u2019s space.",
        "In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round.",
        "Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.",
        "But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue and cry.",
        "The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner.",
        "They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting \u201cStop thief!\u201d too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens.",
        "Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self preservation is the first law of nature.",
        "If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this.",
        "Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.",
        "\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a magic in the sound.",
        "The tradesman leaves his counter, and the car man his waggon; the butcher throws down his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand boy his parcels; the school boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child his battledore.",
        "Away they run, pell mell, helter skelter, slap dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares, and courts, re echo with the sound.",
        "\u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the crowd accumulate at every turning.",
        "Away they fly, splashing through the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d \u201cStop thief! Stop thief!\u201d There is a passion _for hunting something_ deeply implanted in the human breast.",
        "One wretched breathless child, panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.",
        "\u201cStop thief!\u201d Ay, stop him for God\u2019s sake, were it only in mercy! Stopped at last! A clever blow.",
        "He is down upon the pavement; and the crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse.",
        "\u201cStand aside!\u201d \u201cGive him a little air!\u201d \u201cNonsense! he don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s the gentleman?\u201d \u201cHere he is, coming down the street.\u201d \u201cMake room there for the gentleman!\u201d \u201cIs this the boy, sir!\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI am afraid it is the boy.\u201d \u201cAfraid!\u201d murmured the crowd.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che has hurt himself.\u201d \u201c_I_ did that, sir,\u201d said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward; \u201cand preciously I cut my knuckle agin\u2019 his mouth.",
        "_I_ stopped him, sir.\u201d The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.",
        "\u201cCome, get up,\u201d said the man, roughly.",
        "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me indeed, sir.",
        "Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,\u201d said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round.",
        "\u201cThey are here somewhere.\u201d \u201cOh no, they ain\u2019t,\u201d said the officer.",
        "He meant this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to.",
        "\u201cCome, get up!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t hurt him,\u201d said the old gentleman, compassionately.",
        "\u201cOh no, I won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d replied the officer, tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof.",
        "\u201cCome, I know you; it won\u2019t do.",
        "Will you stand upon your legs, you young devil?\u201d Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket collar, at a rapid pace.",
        "The gentleman walked on with them by the officer\u2019s side; and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared back at Oliver from time to time.",
        "The boys shouted in triumph; and on they went.",
        "CHAPTER XI.",
        "TREATS OF MR.",
        "FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.",
        "The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way.",
        "It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d said the man carelessly.",
        "\u201cA young fogle hunter,\u201d replied the man who had Oliver in charge.",
        "\u201cAre you the party that\u2019s been robbed, sir?\u201d inquired the man with the keys.",
        "\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the old gentleman; \u201cbut I am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief.",
        "I\u2014I would rather not press the case.\u201d \u201cMust go before the magistrate now, sir,\u201d replied the man.",
        "\u201cHis worship will be disengaged in half a minute.",
        "Now, young gallows!\u201d This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell.",
        "Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.",
        "This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light.",
        "It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night.",
        "But this is little.",
        "In our station houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges\u2014the word is worth noting\u2014in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces.",
        "Let any one who doubts this, compare the two.",
        "The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock.",
        "He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance.",
        "\u201cThere is something in that boy\u2019s face,\u201d said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; \u201csomething that touches and interests me.",
        "_Can_ he be innocent? He looked like\u2014 Bye the bye,\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, \u201cBless my soul!\u2014where have I seen something like that look before?\u201d After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind\u2019s eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d said the old gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cit must be imagination.\u201d He wandered over them again.",
        "He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them.",
        "There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.",
        "But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver\u2019s features bore a trace.",
        "So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book.",
        "He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office.",
        "He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.",
        "Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side of the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene.",
        "Fang was a lean, long backed, stiff necked, middle sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head.",
        "His face was stern, and much flushed.",
        "If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.",
        "The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate\u2019s desk, said, suiting the action to the word, \u201cThat is my name and address, sir.\u201d He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.",
        "Now, it so happened that Mr.",
        "Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department.",
        "He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl.",
        "\u201cWho are you?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.",
        "\u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper.",
        "\u201cWho is this fellow?\u201d \u201cMy name, sir,\u201d said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman, \u201cmy name, sir, is Brownlow.",
        "Permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person, under the protection of the bench.\u201d Saying this, Mr.",
        "Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information.",
        "\u201cOfficer!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang, throwing the paper on one side, \u201cwhat\u2019s this fellow charged with?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not charged at all, your worship,\u201d replied the officer.",
        "\u201cHe appears against this boy, your worship.\u201d His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a safe one.",
        "\u201cAppears against the boy, does he?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang, surveying Mr.",
        "Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot.",
        "\u201cSwear him!\u201d \u201cBefore I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cand that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have believed\u2014\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, sir!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang, peremptorily.",
        "\u201cI will not, sir!\u201d replied the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cHold your tongue this instant, or I\u2019ll have you turned out of the office!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re an insolent impertinent fellow.",
        "How dare you bully a magistrate!\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.",
        "\u201cSwear this person!\u201d said Fang to the clerk.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll not hear another word.",
        "Swear him.\u201d Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said Fang, \u201cwhat\u2019s the charge against this boy? What have you got to say, sir?\u201d \u201cI was standing at a bookstall\u2014\u201d Mr.",
        "Brownlow began.",
        "\u201cHold your tongue, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cPoliceman! Where\u2019s the policeman? Here, swear this policeman.",
        "Now, policeman, what is this?\u201d The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how that was all he knew about it.",
        "\u201cAre there any witnesses?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cNone, your worship,\u201d replied the policeman.",
        "Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the prosecutor, said in a towering passion.",
        "\u201cDo you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do you not? You have been sworn.",
        "Now, if you stand there, refusing to give evidence, I\u2019ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by\u2014\u201d By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard\u2014accidently, of course.",
        "With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr.",
        "Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy because he had seen him running away; and expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.",
        "\u201cHe has been hurt already,\u201d said the old gentleman in conclusion.",
        "\u201cAnd I fear,\u201d he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, \u201cI really fear that he is ill.\u201d \u201cOh! yes, I dare say!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang, with a sneer.",
        "\u201cCome, none of your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won\u2019t do.",
        "What\u2019s your name?\u201d Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.",
        "He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed turning round and round.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, you hardened scoundrel?\u201d demanded Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cOfficer, what\u2019s his name?\u201d This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was standing by the bar.",
        "He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.",
        "\u201cHe says his name\u2019s Tom White, your worship,\u201d said the kind hearted thief taker.",
        "\u201cOh, he won\u2019t speak out, won\u2019t he?\u201d said Fang.",
        "\u201cVery well, very well.",
        "Where does he live?\u201d \u201cWhere he can, your worship,\u201d replied the officer; again pretending to receive Oliver\u2019s answer.",
        "\u201cHas he any parents?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cHe says they died in his infancy, your worship,\u201d replied the officer: hazarding the usual reply.",
        "At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.",
        "\u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang: \u201cdon\u2019t try to make a fool of me.\u201d \u201cI think he really is ill, your worship,\u201d remonstrated the officer.",
        "\u201cI know better,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cTake care of him, officer,\u201d said the old gentleman, raising his hands instinctively; \u201che\u2019ll fall down.\u201d \u201cStand away, officer,\u201d cried Fang; \u201clet him, if he likes.\u201d Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a fainting fit.",
        "The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared to stir.",
        "\u201cI knew he was shamming,\u201d said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof of the fact.",
        "\u201cLet him lie there; he\u2019ll soon be tired of that.\u201d \u201cHow do you propose to deal with the case, sir?\u201d inquired the clerk in a low voice.",
        "\u201cSummarily,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cHe stands committed for three months\u2014hard labour of course.",
        "Clear the office.\u201d The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.",
        "\u201cStop, stop! don\u2019t take him away! For Heaven\u2019s sake stop a moment!\u201d cried the new comer, breathless with haste.",
        "Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects, especially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.",
        "Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder.",
        "\u201cWhat is this? Who is this? Turn this man out.",
        "Clear the office!\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Fang.",
        "\u201cI _will_ speak,\u201d cried the man; \u201cI will not be turned out.",
        "I saw it all.",
        "I keep the book stall.",
        "I demand to be sworn.",
        "I will not be put down.",
        "Fang, you must hear me.",
        "You must not refuse, sir.\u201d The man was right.",
        "His manner was determined; and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up.",
        "\u201cSwear the man,\u201d growled Mr.",
        "Fang, with a very ill grace.",
        "\u201cNow, man, what have you got to say?\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d said the man: \u201cI saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here: loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was reading.",
        "The robbery was committed by another boy.",
        "I saw it done; and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.\u201d Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book stall keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery.",
        "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come here before?\u201d said Fang, after a pause.",
        "\u201cI hadn\u2019t a soul to mind the shop,\u201d replied the man.",
        "\u201cEverybody who could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit.",
        "I could get nobody till five minutes ago; and I\u2019ve run here all the way.\u201d \u201cThe prosecutor was reading, was he?\u201d inquired Fang, after another pause.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d replied the man.",
        "\u201cThe very book he has in his hand.\u201d \u201cOh, that book, eh?\u201d said Fang.",
        "\u201cIs it paid for?\u201d \u201cNo, it is not,\u201d replied the man, with a smile.",
        "\u201cDear me, I forgot all about it!\u201d exclaimed the absent old gentleman, innocently.",
        "\u201cA nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!\u201d said Fang, with a comical effort to look humane.",
        "\u201cI consider, sir, that you have obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute.",
        "Let this be a lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.",
        "The boy is discharged.",
        "Clear the office!\u201d \u201cD\u2014n me!\u201d cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long, \u201cd\u2014n me! I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \u201cClear the office!\u201d said the magistrate.",
        "\u201cOfficers, do you hear? Clear the office!\u201d The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr.",
        "Brownlow was conveyed out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.",
        "He reached the yard; and his passion vanished in a moment.",
        "Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.",
        "\u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, bending over him.",
        "\u201cCall a coach, somebody, pray.",
        "Directly!\u201d A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.",
        "\u201cMay I accompany you?\u201d said the book stall keeper, looking in.",
        "\u201cBless me, yes, my dear sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow quickly.",
        "\u201cI forgot you.",
        "Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in.",
        "Poor fellow! There\u2019s no time to lose.\u201d The book stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.",
        "CHAPTER XII.",
        "IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE.",
        "AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS.",
        "The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville.",
        "Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr.",
        "Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.",
        "But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends.",
        "The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.",
        "The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame.",
        "Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream.",
        "Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.",
        "\u201cWhat room is this? Where have I been brought to?\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cThis is not the place I went to sleep in.\u201d He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but they were overheard at once.",
        "The curtain at the bed\u2019s head was hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm chair close by, in which she had been sitting at needle work.",
        "\u201cHush, my dear,\u201d said the old lady softly.",
        "\u201cYou must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,\u2014as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh.",
        "Lie down again; there\u2019s a dear!\u201d With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver\u2019s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck.",
        "\u201cSave us!\u201d said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.",
        "\u201cWhat a grateful little dear it is.",
        "Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!\u201d \u201cPerhaps she does see me,\u201d whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; \u201cperhaps she has sat by me.",
        "I almost feel as if she had.\u201d \u201cThat was the fever, my dear,\u201d said the old lady mildly.",
        "\u201cI suppose it was,\u201d replied Oliver, \u201cbecause heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy.",
        "But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died.",
        "She can\u2019t know anything about me though,\u201d added Oliver after a moment\u2019s silence.",
        "\u201cIf she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.\u201d The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again.",
        "So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said.",
        "He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.",
        "\u201cYou _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cYes, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cYes, I know you are,\u201d said the gentleman: \u201cYou\u2019re hungry too, an\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d answered Oliver.",
        "\u201cHem!\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cNo, I know you\u2019re not.",
        "He is not hungry, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin,\u201d said the gentleman: looking very wise.",
        "The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man.",
        "The doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself.",
        "\u201cYou feel sleepy, don\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re not sleepy.",
        "Nor thirsty.",
        "Are you?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, rather thirsty,\u201d answered Oliver.",
        "\u201cJust as I expected, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin,\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s very natural that he should be thirsty.",
        "You may give him a little tea, ma\u2019am, and some dry toast without any butter.",
        "Don\u2019t keep him too warm, ma\u2019am; but be careful that you don\u2019t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?\u201d The old lady dropped a curtsey.",
        "The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs.",
        "Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o\u2019clock.",
        "The old lady tenderly bade him good night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come: bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap.",
        "Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings.",
        "These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again.",
        "And thus the night crept slowly on.",
        "Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.",
        "The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy\u2019s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven.",
        "Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from.",
        "Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past! It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy.",
        "The crisis of the disease was safely past.",
        "He belonged to the world again.",
        "In three days\u2019 time he was able to sit in an easy chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper\u2019s room, which belonged to her.",
        "Having him set, here, by the fire side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently.",
        "\u201cNever mind me, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI\u2019m only having a regular good cry.",
        "There; it\u2019s all over now; and I\u2019m quite comfortable.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re very, very kind to me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cWell, never you mind that, my dear,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cthat\u2019s got nothing to do with your broth; and it\u2019s full time you had it; for the doctor says Mr.",
        "Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he\u2019ll be pleased.\u201d And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.",
        "\u201cAre you fond of pictures, dear?\u201d inquired the old lady, seeing that Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against the wall; just opposite his chair.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t quite know, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the canvas; \u201cI have seen so few that I hardly know.",
        "What a beautiful, mild face that lady\u2019s is!\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said the old lady, \u201cpainters always make ladies out prettier than they are, or they wouldn\u2019t get any custom, child.",
        "The man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known _that_ would never succeed; it\u2019s a deal too honest.",
        "A deal,\u201d said the old lady, laughing very heartily at her own acuteness.",
        "\u201cIs\u2014is that a likeness, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; \u201cthat\u2019s a portrait.\u201d \u201cWhose, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver.",
        "\u201cWhy, really, my dear, I don\u2019t know,\u201d answered the old lady in a good humoured manner.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know, I expect.",
        "It seems to strike your fancy, dear.\u201d \u201cIt is so pretty,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cWhy, sure you\u2019re not afraid of it?\u201d said the old lady: observing in great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting.",
        "\u201cOh no, no,\u201d returned Oliver quickly; \u201cbut the eyes look so sorrowful; and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.",
        "It makes my heart beat,\u201d added Oliver in a low voice, \u201cas if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cLord save us!\u201d exclaimed the old lady, starting; \u201cdon\u2019t talk in that way, child.",
        "You\u2019re weak and nervous after your illness.",
        "Let me wheel your chair round to the other side; and then you won\u2019t see it.",
        "There!\u201d said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; \u201cyou don\u2019t see it now, at all events.\u201d Oliver _did_ see it in his mind\u2019s eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation.",
        "Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition.",
        "He had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the door.",
        "\u201cCome in,\u201d said the old lady; and in walked Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressing gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions.",
        "Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s heart, being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain.",
        "\u201cPoor boy, poor boy!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, clearing his throat.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m rather hoarse this morning, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin.",
        "I\u2019m afraid I have caught cold.\u201d \u201cI hope not, sir,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Bedwin.",
        "\u201cEverything you have had, has been well aired, sir.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Bedwin.",
        "I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cI rather think I had a damp napkin at dinner time yesterday; but never mind that.",
        "How do you feel, my dear?\u201d \u201cVery happy, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cAnd very grateful indeed, sir, for your goodness to me.\u201d \u201cGood boy,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, stoutly.",
        "\u201cHave you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?\u201d \u201cHe has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the last word, to intimate that between slops, and broth well compounded, there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.",
        "\u201cUgh!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, with a slight shudder; \u201ca couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good.",
        "Wouldn\u2019t they, Tom White, eh?\u201d \u201cMy name is Oliver, sir,\u201d replied the little invalid with a look of great astonishment.",
        "\u201cOliver,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cOliver what? Oliver White, eh?\u201d \u201cNo, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.\u201d \u201cQueer name!\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhat made you tell the magistrate your name was White?\u201d \u201cI never told him so, sir,\u201d returned Oliver in amazement.",
        "This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in Oliver\u2019s face.",
        "It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.",
        "\u201cSome mistake,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "But, although his motive for looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.",
        "\u201cI hope you are not angry with me, sir?\u201d said Oliver, raising his eyes beseechingly.",
        "\u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhy! what\u2019s this? Bedwin, look there!\u201d As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver\u2019s head, and then to the boy\u2019s face.",
        "There was its living copy.",
        "The eyes, the head, the mouth; every feature was the same.",
        "The expression was, for the instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy! Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away.",
        "A weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording\u2014 That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue and cry which was raised at Oliver\u2019s heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound judging philosophers have laid down as the main springs of all Nature\u2019s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady\u2019s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.",
        "For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex.",
        "If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut.",
        "Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves.",
        "Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.",
        "It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway.",
        "Having remained silent here, just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d inquired the Dodger.",
        "\u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d roared Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cHold your noise,\u201d remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.",
        "\u201cDo you want to be grabbed, stupid?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Charley, \u201cI can\u2019t help it! To see him splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again\u2019 the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him\u2014oh, my eye!\u201d The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours.",
        "As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door step, and laughed louder than before.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019ll Fagin say?\u201d inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.",
        "\u201cWhat?\u201d repeated Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cAh, what?\u201d said the Dodger.",
        "\u201cWhy, what should he say?\u201d inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in his merriment; for the Dodger\u2019s manner was impressive.",
        "\u201cWhat should he say?\u201d Mr.",
        "Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat, scratched his head, and nodded thrice.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Charley.",
        "\u201cToor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn\u2019t, and high cockolorum,\u201d said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance.",
        "This was explanatory, but not satisfactory.",
        "Master Bates felt it so; and again said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the skirts of his long tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half dozen times in a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court.",
        "Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.",
        "The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.",
        "There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened.",
        "\u201cWhy, how\u2019s this?\u201d muttered the Jew: changing countenance; \u201conly two of \u2019em? Where\u2019s the third? They can\u2019t have got into trouble.",
        "Hark!\u201d The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing.",
        "The door was slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind them.",
        "CHAPTER XIII.",
        "SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY \u201cWhere\u2019s Oliver?\u201d said the Jew, rising with a menacing look.",
        "\u201cWhere\u2019s the boy?\u201d The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence; and looked uneasily at each other.",
        "But they made no reply.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s become of the boy?\u201d said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations.",
        "\u201cSpeak out, or I\u2019ll throttle you!\u201d Mr.",
        "Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud, well sustained, and continuous roar\u2014something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet.",
        "\u201cWill you speak?\u201d thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.",
        "\u201cWhy, the traps have got him, and that\u2019s all about it,\u201d said the Dodger, sullenly.",
        "\u201cCome, let go o\u2019 me, will you!\u201d And, swinging himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew\u2019s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old gentleman\u2019s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced.",
        "The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant\u2019s head.",
        "But Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhy, what the blazes is in the wind now!\u201d growled a deep voice.",
        "\u201cWho pitched that \u2019ere at me? It\u2019s well it\u2019s the beer, and not the pot, as hit me, or I\u2019d have settled somebody.",
        "I might have know\u2019d, as nobody but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water\u2014and not that, unless he done the River Company every quarter.",
        "Wot\u2019s it all about, Fagin? D\u2014me, if my neck handkercher an\u2019t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master! Come in!\u201d The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly built fellow of about five and thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;\u2014the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them.",
        "He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke.",
        "He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days\u2019 growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow.",
        "\u201cCome in, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d growled this engaging ruffian.",
        "A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room.",
        "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in afore?\u201d said the man.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re getting too proud to own me afore company, are you? Lie down!\u201d This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the other end of the room.",
        "He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking his very ill looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.",
        "\u201cWhat are you up to? Ill treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious, in sa ti a ble old fence?\u201d said the man, seating himself deliberately.",
        "\u201cI wonder they don\u2019t murder you! I would if I was them.",
        "If I\u2019d been your \u2019prentice, I\u2019d have done it long ago, and\u2014no, I couldn\u2019t have sold you afterwards, for you\u2019re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don\u2019t blow glass bottles large enough.\u201d \u201cHush! hush! Mr.",
        "Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, trembling; \u201cdon\u2019t speak so loud!\u201d \u201cNone of your mistering,\u201d replied the ruffian; \u201cyou always mean mischief when you come that.",
        "You know my name: out with it! I shan\u2019t disgrace it when the time comes.\u201d \u201cWell, well, then\u2014Bill Sikes,\u201d said the Jew, with abject humility.",
        "\u201cYou seem out of humour, Bill.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I am,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI should think you was rather out of sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as you do when you blab and\u2014\u201d \u201cAre you mad?\u201d said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing towards the boys.",
        "Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.",
        "He then, in cant terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass of liquor.",
        "\u201cAnd mind you don\u2019t poison it,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, laying his hat upon the table.",
        "This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all events) to improve upon the distiller\u2019s ingenuity not very far from the old gentleman\u2019s merry heart.",
        "After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr.",
        "Sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver\u2019s capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cthat he may say something which will get us into trouble.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very likely,\u201d returned Sikes with a malicious grin.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re blowed upon, Fagin.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid, you see,\u201d added the Jew, speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.\u201d The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.",
        "But the old gentleman\u2019s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall.",
        "There was a long pause.",
        "Every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out.",
        "\u201cSomebody must find out wot\u2019s been done at the office,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.",
        "The Jew nodded assent.",
        "\u201cIf he hasn\u2019t peached, and is committed, there\u2019s no fear till he comes out again,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, \u201cand then he must be taken care on.",
        "You must get hold of him somehow.\u201d Again the Jew nodded.",
        "The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but, unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted.",
        "This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr.",
        "William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply rooted antipathy to going near a police office on any ground or pretext whatever.",
        "How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess.",
        "It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.",
        "\u201cThe very thing!\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cBet will go; won\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d \u201cWheres?\u201d inquired the young lady.",
        "\u201cOnly just up to the office, my dear,\u201d said the Jew coaxingly.",
        "It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be \u201cblessed\u201d if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.",
        "The Jew\u2019s countenance fell.",
        "He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl papers, to the other female.",
        "\u201cNancy, my dear,\u201d said the Jew in a soothing manner, \u201cwhat do _you_ say?\u201d \u201cThat it won\u2019t do; so it\u2019s no use a trying it on, Fagin,\u201d replied Nancy.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, looking up in a surly manner.",
        "\u201cWhat I say, Bill,\u201d replied the lady collectedly.",
        "\u201cWhy, you\u2019re just the very person for it,\u201d reasoned Mr.",
        "Sikes: \u201cnobody about here knows anything of you.\u201d \u201cAnd as I don\u2019t want \u2019em to, neither,\u201d replied Nancy in the same composed manner, \u201cit\u2019s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll go, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cNo, she won\u2019t, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy.",
        "\u201cYes, she will, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "And Mr.",
        "Sikes was right.",
        "By dint of alternate threats, promises, and bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission.",
        "She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.",
        "Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,\u2014both articles of dress being provided from the Jew\u2019s inexhaustible stock,\u2014Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand.",
        "\u201cStop a minute, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, producing, a little covered basket.",
        "\u201cCarry that in one hand.",
        "It looks more respectable, my dear.\u201d \u201cGive her a door key to carry in her t\u2019other one, Fagin,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cit looks real and genivine like.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, my dear, so it does,\u201d said the Jew, hanging a large street door key on the forefinger of the young lady\u2019s right hand.",
        "\u201cThere; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!\u201d said the Jew, rubbing his hands.",
        "\u201cOh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!\u201d exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the street door key in an agony of distress.",
        "\u201cWhat has become of him! Where have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what\u2019s been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!\u201d Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart broken tone: to the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.",
        "\u201cAh, she\u2019s a clever girl, my dears,\u201d said the Jew, turning round to his young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s a honour to her sex,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, filling his glass, and smiting the table with his enormous fist.",
        "\u201cHere\u2019s her health, and wishing they was all like her!\u201d While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the police office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.",
        "Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the cell doors, and listened.",
        "There was no sound within: so she coughed and listened again.",
        "Still there was no reply: so she spoke.",
        "\u201cNolly, dear?\u201d murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; \u201cNolly?\u201d There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr.",
        "Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument.",
        "He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d cried a faint and feeble voice.",
        "\u201cIs there a little boy here?\u201d inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied the voice; \u201cGod forbid.\u201d This was a vagrant of sixty five, who was going to prison for _not_ playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and doing nothing for his livelihood.",
        "In the next cell was another man, who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp office.",
        "But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother.",
        "\u201cI haven\u2019t got him, my dear,\u201d said the old man.",
        "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.",
        "\u201cWhy, the gentleman\u2019s got him,\u201d replied the officer.",
        "\u201cWhat gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?\u201d exclaimed Nancy.",
        "In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence: of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman.",
        "In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of, to the domicile of the Jew.",
        "Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company good morning.",
        "\u201cWe must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,\u201d said the Jew greatly excited.",
        "\u201cCharley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found.",
        "I trust to you, my dear,\u2014to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,\u201d added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; \u201cthere\u2019s money, my dears.",
        "I shall shut up this shop tonight.",
        "You\u2019ll know where to find me! Don\u2019t stop here a minute.",
        "Not an instant, my dears!\u201d With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully double locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.",
        "Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing.",
        "A rap at the door startled him in this occupation.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he cried in a shrill tone.",
        "\u201cMe!\u201d replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key hole.",
        "\u201cWhat now?\u201d cried the Jew impatiently.",
        "\u201cIs he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?\u201d inquired the Dodger.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d replied the Jew, \u201cwherever she lays hands on him.",
        "Find him, find him out, that\u2019s all.",
        "I shall know what to do next; never fear.\u201d The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his companions.",
        "\u201cHe has not peached so far,\u201d said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.",
        "\u201cIf he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.\u201d CHAPTER XIV.",
        "COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER\u2019S STAY AT MR.",
        "BROWNLOW\u2019S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR.",
        "GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND Oliver soon recovering from the fainting fit into which Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, in the conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver\u2019s history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him.",
        "He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but, when he came down into the housekeeper\u2019s room next day, his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady.",
        "His expectations were disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver\u2019s eyes.",
        "\u201cIt is gone, you see.\u201d \u201cI see it is ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cWhy have they taken it away?\u201d \u201cIt has been taken down, child, because Mr.",
        "Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,\u201d rejoined the old lady.",
        "\u201cOh, no, indeed.",
        "It didn\u2019t worry me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cI liked to see it.",
        "I quite loved it.\u201d \u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old lady, good humouredly; \u201cyou get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again.",
        "There! I promise you that! Now, let us talk about something else.\u201d This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time.",
        "As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them.",
        "When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six and twenty years, it was time to have tea.",
        "After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed.",
        "They were happy days, those of Oliver\u2019s recovery.",
        "Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself.",
        "He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr.",
        "Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him.",
        "As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.",
        "This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again.",
        "They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.",
        "One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.",
        "Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while.",
        "\u201cBless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Bedwin.",
        "\u201cDear heart alive! If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!\u201d Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say: looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn\u2019t think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.",
        "Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.",
        "On Mr.",
        "Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens.",
        "There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.",
        "Brownlow was seated reading.",
        "When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.",
        "Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser.",
        "Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives.",
        "\u201cThere are a good many books, are there not, my boy?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.",
        "\u201cA great number, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cI never saw so many.\u201d \u201cYou shall read them, if you behave well,\u201d said the old gentleman kindly; \u201cand you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,\u2014that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.\u201d \u201cI suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,\u201d said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.",
        "\u201cNot always those,\u201d said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; \u201cthere are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size.",
        "How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?\u201d \u201cI think I would rather read them, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cWhat! wouldn\u2019t you like to be a book writer?\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.",
        "Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was.",
        "\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the old gentleman, composing his features.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! We won\u2019t make an author of you, while there\u2019s an honest trade to be learnt, or brick making to turn to.\u201d \u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, \u201cI want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say.",
        "I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman\u2019s commencement! \u201cDon\u2019t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again.",
        "Let me stay here, and be a servant.",
        "Don\u2019t send me back to the wretched place I came from.",
        "Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!\u201d \u201cMy dear child,\u201d said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver\u2019s sudden appeal; \u201cyou need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.\u201d \u201cI never, never will, sir,\u201d interposed Oliver.",
        "\u201cI hope not,\u201d rejoined the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cI do not think you ever will.",
        "I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself.",
        "The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.",
        "Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.\u201d As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver sat quite still.",
        "\u201cWell, well!\u201d said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, \u201cI only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.",
        "You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement.",
        "Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.",
        "Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.\u201d Oliver\u2019s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr.",
        "Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double knock was heard at the street door: and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cIs he coming up?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied the servant.",
        "\u201cHe asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.\u201d Mr.",
        "Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr.",
        "Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know.",
        "\u201cShall I go downstairs, sir?\u201d inquired Oliver.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cI would rather you remained here.\u201d At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green.",
        "A very small plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it.",
        "The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description.",
        "He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot.",
        "In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange peel at arm\u2019s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice, \u201cLook here! do you see this! Isn\u2019t it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can\u2019t call at a man\u2019s house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon\u2019s friend on the staircase? I\u2019ve been lamed with orange peel once, and I know orange peel will be my death, or I\u2019ll be content to eat my own head, sir!\u201d This was the handsome offer with which Mr.",
        "Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr.",
        "Grimwig\u2019s head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting\u2014to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll eat my head, sir,\u201d repeated Mr.",
        "Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground.",
        "\u201cHallo! what\u2019s that!\u201d looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two.",
        "\u201cThis is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "Oliver bowed.",
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say that\u2019s the boy who had the fever, I hope?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, recoiling a little more.",
        "\u201cWait a minute! Don\u2019t speak! Stop\u2014\u201d continued Mr.",
        "Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery; \u201cthat\u2019s the boy who had the orange! If that\u2019s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase, I\u2019ll eat my head, and his too.\u201d \u201cNo, no, he has not had one,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, laughing.",
        "\u201cCome! Put down your hat; and speak to my young friend.\u201d \u201cI feel strongly on this subject, sir,\u201d said the irritable old gentleman, drawing off his gloves.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s always more or less orange peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it\u2019s put there by the surgeon\u2019s boy at the corner.",
        "A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell against my garden railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime light.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t go to him,\u2019 I called out of the window, \u2018he\u2019s an assassin! A man trap!\u2019 So he is.",
        "If he is not\u2014\u201d Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer, whenever it was not expressed in words.",
        "Then, still keeping his stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the boy, is it?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, at length.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the boy,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cHow are you, boy?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cA great deal better, thank you, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs.",
        "Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the visitor\u2019s manner, he was very happy to do.",
        "\u201cHe is a nice looking boy, is he not?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Grimwig, pettishly.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cNo.",
        "I don\u2019t know.",
        "I never see any difference in boys.",
        "I only knew two sort of boys.",
        "Mealy boys, and beef faced boys.\u201d \u201cAnd which is Oliver?\u201d \u201cMealy.",
        "I know a friend who has a beef faced boy; a fine boy, they call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf.",
        "I know him! The wretch!\u201d \u201cCome,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cthese are not the characteristics of young Oliver Twist; so he needn\u2019t excite your wrath.\u201d \u201cThey are not,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cHe may have worse.\u201d Here, Mr.",
        "Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.",
        "Grimwig the most exquisite delight.",
        "\u201cHe may have worse, I say,\u201d repeated Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cWhere does he come from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever.",
        "What of that? Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes; haven\u2019t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his master.",
        "He had had a fever six times; he wasn\u2019t recommended to mercy on that account.",
        "Pooh! nonsense!\u201d Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.",
        "Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver\u2019s appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was well looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to oppose his friend.",
        "When Mr.",
        "Brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had postponed any investigation into Oliver\u2019s previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr.",
        "Grimwig chuckled maliciously.",
        "And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn\u2019t find a table spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content to\u2014and so forth.",
        "All this, Mr.",
        "Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman: knowing his friend\u2019s peculiarities, bore with great good humour; as Mr.",
        "Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman\u2019s presence.",
        "\u201cAnd when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?\u201d asked Grimwig of Mr.",
        "Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed his subject.",
        "\u201cTomorrow morning,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cI would rather he was alone with me at the time.",
        "Come up to me tomorrow morning at ten o\u2019clock, my dear.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "He answered with some hesitation, because he was confused by Mr.",
        "Grimwig\u2019s looking so hard at him.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d whispered that gentleman to Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201che won\u2019t come up to you tomorrow morning.",
        "I saw him hesitate.",
        "He is deceiving you, my good friend.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll swear he is not,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, warmly.",
        "\u201cIf he is not,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d and down went the stick.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll answer for that boy\u2019s truth with my life!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, knocking the table.",
        "\u201cAnd I for his falsehood with my head!\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Grimwig, knocking the table also.",
        "\u201cWe shall see,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, checking his rising anger.",
        "\u201cWe will,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Grimwig, with a provoking smile; \u201cwe will.\u201d As fate would have it, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a small parcel of books, which Mr.",
        "Brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstall keeper, who has already figured in this history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.",
        "\u201cStop the boy, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cthere is something to go back.\u201d \u201cHe has gone, sir,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Bedwin.",
        "\u201cCall after him,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cit\u2019s particular.",
        "He is a poor man, and they are not paid for.",
        "There are some books to be taken back, too.\u201d The street door was opened.",
        "Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another; and Mrs.",
        "Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was no boy in sight.",
        "Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.",
        "\u201cDear me, I am very sorry for that,\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cI particularly wished those books to be returned tonight.\u201d \u201cSend Oliver with them,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, with an ironical smile; \u201che will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.\u201d \u201cYes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll run all the way, sir.\u201d The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr.",
        "Grimwig determined him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at least: at once.",
        "\u201cYou _shall_ go, my dear,\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cThe books are on a chair by my table.",
        "Fetch them down.\u201d Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.",
        "\u201cYou are to say,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; \u201cyou are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.",
        "This is a five pound note, so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t be ten minutes, sir,\u201d said Oliver, eagerly.",
        "Having buttoned up the bank note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.",
        "Bedwin followed him to the street door, giving him many directions about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which Oliver said he clearly understood.",
        "Having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart.",
        "\u201cBless his sweet face!\u201d said the old lady, looking after him.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.\u201d At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the corner.",
        "The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the door, went back to her own room.",
        "\u201cLet me see; he\u2019ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table.",
        "\u201cIt will be dark by that time.\u201d \u201cOh! you really expect him to come back, do you?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Brownlow, smiling.",
        "The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr.",
        "Grimwig\u2019s breast, at the moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend\u2019s confident smile.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiting the table with his fist, \u201cI do not.",
        "The boy has a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm, and a five pound note in his pocket.",
        "He\u2019ll join his old friends the thieves, and laugh at you.",
        "If ever that boy returns to this house, sir, I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.",
        "It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions, that, although Mr.",
        "Grimwig was not by any means a bad hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.",
        "It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial plate were scarcely discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence, with the watch between them.",
        "CHAPTER XV.",
        "SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE In the obscure parlour of a low public house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas light burnt all day in the winter time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr.",
        "William Sikes.",
        "At his feet, sat a white coated, red eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.",
        "\u201cKeep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, suddenly breaking silence.",
        "Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog\u2019s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration.",
        "Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.",
        "Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr.",
        "Sikes\u2019s dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half boots.",
        "Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.",
        "Sikes levelled at his head.",
        "\u201cYou would, would you?\u201d said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and deliberately opening with the other a large clasp knife, which he drew from his pocket.",
        "\u201cCome here, you born devil! Come here! D\u2019ye hear?\u201d The dog no doubt heard; because Mr.",
        "Sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast.",
        "This resistance only infuriated Mr.",
        "Sikes the more; who, dropping on his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.",
        "The dog jumped from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the clasp knife in his hands.",
        "There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.",
        "Sikes, being disappointed of the dog\u2019s participation, at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.",
        "\u201cWhat the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?\u201d said Sikes, with a fierce gesture.",
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t know, my dear, I didn\u2019t know,\u201d replied Fagin, humbly; for the Jew was the new comer.",
        "\u201cDidn\u2019t know, you white livered thief!\u201d growled Sikes.",
        "\u201cCouldn\u2019t you hear the noise?\u201d \u201cNot a sound of it, as I\u2019m a living man, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cOh no! You hear nothing, you don\u2019t,\u201d retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer.",
        "\u201cSneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d inquired the Jew with a forced smile.",
        "\u201c\u2019Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as haven\u2019t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,\u201d replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; \u201cthat\u2019s why.\u201d The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend.",
        "He was obviously very ill at ease, however.",
        "\u201cGrin away,\u201d said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with savage contempt; \u201cgrin away.",
        "You\u2019ll never have the laugh at me, though, unless it\u2019s behind a nightcap.",
        "I\u2019ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin; and, d\u2014me, I\u2019ll keep it.",
        "There! If I go, you go; so take care of me.\u201d \u201cWell, well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, \u201cI know all that; we\u2014we\u2014have a mutual interest, Bill,\u2014a mutual interest.\u201d \u201cHumph,\u201d said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the Jew\u2019s side than on his.",
        "\u201cWell, what have you got to say to me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all passed safe through the melting pot,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand this is your share.",
        "It\u2019s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I know you\u2019ll do me a good turn another time, and\u2014\u201d \u201cStow that gammon,\u201d interposed the robber, impatiently.",
        "\u201cWhere is it? Hand over!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,\u201d replied the Jew, soothingly.",
        "\u201cHere it is! All safe!\u201d As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown paper packet.",
        "Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.",
        "\u201cThis is all, is it?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cAll,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cYou haven\u2019t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along, have you?\u201d inquired Sikes, suspiciously.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t put on an injured look at the question; you\u2019ve done it many a time.",
        "Jerk the tinkler.\u201d These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.",
        "It was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance.",
        "Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.",
        "The Jew, perfectly understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person.",
        "It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the boot lace which the dog had torn.",
        "Possibly, if he had observed the brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to him.",
        "\u201cIs anybody here, Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin; speaking, now that Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.",
        "\u201cDot a shoul,\u201d replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the heart or not: made their way through the nose.",
        "\u201cNobody?\u201d inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.",
        "\u201cDobody but Biss Dadsy,\u201d replied Barney.",
        "\u201cNancy!\u201d exclaimed Sikes.",
        "\u201cWhere? Strike me blind, if I don\u2019t honour that \u2019ere girl, for her native talents.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,\u201d replied Barney.",
        "\u201cSend her here,\u201d said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor.",
        "\u201cSend her here.\u201d Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet, apron, basket, and street door key, complete.",
        "\u201cYou are on the scent, are you, Nancy?\u201d inquired Sikes, proffering the glass.",
        "\u201cYes, I am, Bill,\u201d replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; \u201cand tired enough of it I am, too.",
        "The young brat\u2019s been ill and confined to the crib; and\u2014\u201d \u201cAh, Nancy, dear!\u201d said Fagin, looking up.",
        "Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew\u2019s red eye brows, and a half closing of his deeply set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.",
        "The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.",
        "Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters.",
        "In about ten minutes\u2019 time, Mr.",
        "Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.",
        "Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back yard as soon as his master was out of sight.",
        "The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it; looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the Hue and Cry.",
        "Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book stall.",
        "When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had got half way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.",
        "He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.",
        "\u201cOh, my dear brother!\u201d And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d cried Oliver, struggling.",
        "\u201cLet go of me.",
        "Who is it? What are you stopping me for?\u201d The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a street door key in her hand.",
        "\u201cOh my gracious!\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI have found him! Oh! Oliver! Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your account! Come home, dear, come.",
        "Oh, I\u2019ve found him.",
        "Thank gracious goodness heavins, I\u2019ve found him!\u201d With these incoherent exclamations, the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butcher\u2019s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also looking on, whether he didn\u2019t think he had better run for the doctor.",
        "To which, the butcher\u2019s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent disposition: replied, that he thought not.",
        "\u201cOh, no, no, never mind,\u201d said the young woman, grasping Oliver\u2019s hand; \u201cI\u2019m better now.",
        "Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!\u201d \u201cOh, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the young woman, \u201che ran away, near a month ago, from his parents, who are hard working and respectable people; and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother\u2019s heart.\u201d \u201cYoung wretch!\u201d said one woman.",
        "\u201cGo home, do, you little brute,\u201d said the other.",
        "\u201cI am not,\u201d replied Oliver, greatly alarmed.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know her.",
        "I haven\u2019t any sister, or father and mother either.",
        "I\u2019m an orphan; I live at Pentonville.\u201d \u201cOnly hear him, how he braves it out!\u201d cried the young woman.",
        "\u201cWhy, it\u2019s Nancy!\u201d exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.",
        "\u201cYou see he knows me!\u201d cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders.",
        "\u201cHe can\u2019t help himself.",
        "Make him come home, there\u2019s good people, or he\u2019ll kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!\u201d \u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d said a man, bursting out of a beer shop, with a white dog at his heels; \u201cyoung Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you young dog! Come home directly.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t belong to them.",
        "I don\u2019t know them.",
        "Help! help!\u201d cried Oliver, struggling in the man\u2019s powerful grasp.",
        "\u201cHelp!\u201d repeated the man.",
        "\u201cYes; I\u2019ll help you, you young rascal! What books are these? You\u2019ve been a stealing \u2019em, have you? Give \u2019em here.\u201d With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and struck him on the head.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d cried a looker on, from a garret window.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the only way of bringing him to his senses!\u201d \u201cTo be sure!\u201d cried a sleepy faced carpenter, casting an approving look at the garret window.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019ll do him good!\u201d said the two women.",
        "\u201cAnd he shall have it, too!\u201d rejoined the man, administering another blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.",
        "\u201cCome on, you young villain! Here, Bull\u2019s eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!\u201d Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.",
        "In another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible.",
        "It was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain.",
        "The gas lamps were lighted; Mrs.",
        "Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.",
        "CHAPTER XVI.",
        "RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications of a cattle market.",
        "Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot: the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.",
        "Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy\u2019s hand.",
        "\u201cDo you hear?\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.",
        "They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.",
        "Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail.",
        "He held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.",
        "\u201cGive me the other,\u201d said Sikes, seizing Oliver\u2019s unoccupied hand.",
        "\u201cHere, Bull\u2019s Eye!\u201d The dog looked up, and growled.",
        "\u201cSee here, boy!\u201d said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver\u2019s throat; \u201cif he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D\u2019ye mind!\u201d The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn\u2019t!\u201d said Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.",
        "\u201cNow, you know what you\u2019ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.",
        "Get on, young \u2019un!\u201d Bull\u2019s eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.",
        "It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary.",
        "The night was dark and foggy.",
        "The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver\u2019s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.",
        "They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church bell struck the hour.",
        "With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.",
        "\u201cEight o\u2019clock, Bill,\u201d said Nancy, when the bell ceased.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can\u2019t I?\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cI wonder whether _they_ can hear it,\u201d said Nancy.",
        "\u201cOf course they can,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cIt was Bartlemy time when I was shopped; and there warn\u2019t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn\u2019t hear the squeaking on.",
        "Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.\u201d \u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded.",
        "\u201cOh, Bill, such fine young chaps as them!\u201d \u201cYes; that\u2019s all you women think of,\u201d answered Sikes.",
        "\u201cFine young chaps! Well, they\u2019re as good as dead, so it don\u2019t much matter.\u201d With this consolation, Mr.",
        "Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver\u2019s wrist more firmly, told him to step out again.",
        "\u201cWait a minute!\u201d said the girl: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurry by, if it was you that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o\u2019clock struck, Bill.",
        "I\u2019d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the ground, and I hadn\u2019t a shawl to cover me.\u201d \u201cAnd what good would that do?\u201d inquired the unsentimental Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "\u201cUnless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for all the good it would do me.",
        "Come on, and don\u2019t stand preaching there.\u201d The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and they walked away.",
        "But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her face as they passed a gas lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.",
        "They walked on, by little frequented and dirty ways, for a full half hour: meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr.",
        "Sikes himself.",
        "At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which looked as if it had hung there for many years.",
        "\u201cAll right,\u201d cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.",
        "Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.",
        "They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few moments under a lamp.",
        "A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened.",
        "Sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three were quickly inside the house.",
        "The passage was perfectly dark.",
        "They waited, while the person who had let them in, chained and barred the door.",
        "\u201cAnybody here?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.",
        "\u201cIs the old \u2019un here?\u201d asked the robber.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d replied the voice, \u201cand precious down in the mouth he has been.",
        "Won\u2019t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!\u201d The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed familiar to Oliver\u2019s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness.",
        "\u201cLet\u2019s have a glim,\u201d said Sikes, \u201cor we shall go breaking our necks, or treading on the dog.",
        "Look after your legs if you do!\u201d \u201cStand still a moment, and I\u2019ll get you one,\u201d replied the voice.",
        "The receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the form of Mr.",
        "John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.",
        "He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.",
        "The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs.",
        "They crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small back yard, were received with a shout of laughter.",
        "\u201cOh, my wig, my wig!\u201d cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded: \u201chere he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin, look at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can\u2019t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I can\u2019t bear it.",
        "Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.\u201d With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy of facetious joy.",
        "Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy.",
        "The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business, rifled Oliver\u2019s pockets with steady assiduity.",
        "\u201cLook at his togs, Fagin!\u201d said Charley, putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.",
        "\u201cLook at his togs! Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books, too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!\u201d \u201cDelighted to see you looking so well, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, bowing with mock humility.",
        "\u201cThe Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.",
        "Why didn\u2019t you write, my dear, and say you were coming? We\u2019d have got something warm for supper.\u201d At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed, and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five pound note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment.",
        "\u201cHallo, what\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized the note.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s mine, Fagin.\u201d \u201cNo, no, my dear,\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cMine, Bill, mine.",
        "You shall have the books.\u201d \u201cIf that ain\u2019t mine!\u201d said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a determined air; \u201cmine and Nancy\u2019s that is; I\u2019ll take the boy back again.\u201d The Jew started.",
        "Oliver started too, though from a very different cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.",
        "\u201cCome! Hand over, will you?\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cThis is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?\u201d inquired the Jew.",
        "\u201cFair, or not fair,\u201d retorted Sikes, \u201chand over, I tell you! Do you think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it here!\u201d With this gentle remonstrance, Mr.",
        "Sikes plucked the note from between the Jew\u2019s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s for our share of the trouble,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cand not half enough, neither.",
        "You may keep the books, if you\u2019re fond of reading.",
        "If you ain\u2019t, sell \u2019em.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re very pretty,\u201d said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; \u201cbeautiful writing, isn\u2019t is, Oliver?\u201d At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first.",
        "\u201cThey belong to the old gentleman,\u201d said Oliver, wringing his hands; \u201cto the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever.",
        "Oh, pray send them back; send him back the books and money.",
        "Keep me here all my life long; but pray, pray send them back.",
        "He\u2019ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them.",
        "Oh, do have mercy upon me, and send them back!\u201d With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew\u2019s feet; and beat his hands together, in perfect desperation.",
        "\u201cThe boy\u2019s right,\u201d remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re right, Oliver, you\u2019re right; they _will_ think you have stolen \u2019em.",
        "Ha! ha!\u201d chuckled the Jew, rubbing his hands, \u201cit couldn\u2019t have happened better, if we had chosen our time!\u201d \u201cOf course it couldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cI know\u2019d that, directly I see him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm.",
        "It\u2019s all right enough.",
        "They\u2019re soft hearted psalm singers, or they wouldn\u2019t have taken him in at all; and they\u2019ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged.",
        "He\u2019s safe enough.\u201d Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare old house echo to the roof.",
        "\u201cKeep back the dog, Bill!\u201d cried Nancy, springing before the door, and closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit.",
        "\u201cKeep back the dog; he\u2019ll tear the boy to pieces.\u201d \u201cServe him right!\u201d cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the girl\u2019s grasp.",
        "\u201cStand off from me, or I\u2019ll split your head against the wall.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care for that, Bill, I don\u2019t care for that,\u201d screamed the girl, struggling violently with the man, \u201cthe child shan\u2019t be torn down by the dog, unless you kill me first.\u201d \u201cShan\u2019t he!\u201d said Sikes, setting his teeth.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll soon do that, if you don\u2019t keep off.\u201d The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here!\u201d said Fagin, looking round.",
        "\u201cThe girl\u2019s gone mad, I think,\u201d replied Sikes, savagely.",
        "\u201cNo, she hasn\u2019t,\u201d said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; \u201cno, she hasn\u2019t, Fagin; don\u2019t think it.\u201d \u201cThen keep quiet, will you?\u201d said the Jew, with a threatening look.",
        "\u201cNo, I won\u2019t do that, neither,\u201d replied Nancy, speaking very loud.",
        "\u201cCome! What do you think of that?\u201d Mr.",
        "Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her, at present.",
        "With the view of diverting the attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.",
        "\u201cSo you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?\u201d said the Jew, taking up a jagged and knotted club which lay in a corner of the fireplace; \u201ceh?\u201d Oliver made no reply.",
        "But he watched the Jew\u2019s motions, and breathed quickly.",
        "\u201cWanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?\u201d sneered the Jew, catching the boy by the arm.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019ll cure you of that, my young master.\u201d The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver\u2019s shoulders with the club; and was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it from his hand.",
        "She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.",
        "\u201cI won\u2019t stand by and see it done, Fagin,\u201d cried the girl.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve got the boy, and what more would you have?\u2014Let him be\u2014let him be\u2014or I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows before my time.\u201d The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.",
        "\u201cWhy, Nancy!\u201d said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during which he and Mr.",
        "Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner; \u201cyou,\u2014you\u2019re more clever than ever tonight.",
        "Ha! ha! my dear, you are acting beautifully.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d said the girl.",
        "\u201cTake care I don\u2019t overdo it.",
        "You will be the worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of me.\u201d There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair; which few men like to provoke.",
        "The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy\u2019s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.",
        "Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention.",
        "As they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible arguments.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean by this?\u201d said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as measles: \u201cwhat do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are, and what you are?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I know all about it,\u201d replied the girl, laughing hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of indifference.",
        "\u201cWell, then, keep quiet,\u201d rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog, \u201cor I\u2019ll quiet you for a good long time to come.\u201d The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood came.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a nice one,\u201d added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air, \u201cto take up the humane and gen\u2014teel side! A pretty subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!\u201d \u201cGod Almighty help me, I am!\u201d cried the girl passionately; \u201cand I wish I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here.",
        "He\u2019s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that\u2019s bad, from this night forth.",
        "Isn\u2019t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?\u201d \u201cCome, come, Sikes,\u201d said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all that passed; \u201cwe must have civil words; civil words, Bill.\u201d \u201cCivil words!\u201d cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.",
        "\u201cCivil words, you villain! Yes, you deserve \u2019em from me.",
        "I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this!\u201d pointing to Oliver.",
        "\u201cI have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since.",
        "Don\u2019t you know it? Speak out! Don\u2019t you know it?\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; \u201cand, if you have, it\u2019s your living!\u201d \u201cAye, it is!\u201d returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream.",
        "\u201cIt is my living; and the cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you\u2019re the wretch that drove me to them long ago, and that\u2019ll keep me there, day and night, day and night, till I die!\u201d \u201cI shall do you a mischief!\u201d interposed the Jew, goaded by these reproaches; \u201ca mischief worse than that, if you say much more!\u201d The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and fainted.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s all right now,\u201d said Sikes, laying her down in a corner.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s uncommon strong in the arms, when she\u2019s up in this way.\u201d The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the worst of having to do with women,\u201d said the Jew, replacing his club; \u201cbut they\u2019re clever, and we can\u2019t get on, in our line, without \u2019em.",
        "Charley, show Oliver to bed.\u201d \u201cI suppose he\u2019d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?\u201d inquired Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which Charley put the question.",
        "Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his whereabout.",
        "\u201cPut off the smart ones,\u201d said Charley, \u201cand I\u2019ll give \u2019em to Fagin to take care of.",
        "What fun it is!\u201d Poor Oliver unwillingly complied.",
        "Master Bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and locking the door behind him.",
        "The noise of Charley\u2019s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was placed.",
        "But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep.",
        "CHAPTER XVII.",
        "OLIVER\u2019S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon.",
        "The hero sinks upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song.",
        "We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where a grey headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.",
        "Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight.",
        "The transitions in real life from well spread boards to death beds, and from mourning weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive lookers on, which makes a vast difference.",
        "The actors in the mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.",
        "As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as the great art of authorship: an author\u2019s skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary.",
        "If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.",
        "Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse gate, and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.",
        "He was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power.",
        "Bumble always carried his head high; but this morning it was higher than usual.",
        "There was an abstraction in his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle\u2019s mind, too great for utterance.",
        "Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along.",
        "He merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs.",
        "Mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care.",
        "\u201cDrat that beadle!\u201d said Mrs.",

        "Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it _is_ a pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.\u201d The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight were uttered to Mr.",
        "Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house.",
        "\u201cMrs.",
        "Mann,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair; \u201cMrs.",
        "Mann, ma\u2019am, good morning.\u201d \u201cWell, and good morning to _you_, sir,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Mann, with many smiles; \u201cand hoping you find yourself well, sir!\u201d \u201cSo so, Mrs.",
        "Mann,\u201d replied the beadle.",
        "\u201cA porochial life is not a bed of roses, Mrs.",
        "Mann.\u201d \u201cAh, that it isn\u2019t indeed, Mr.",

        "Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.",
        "\u201cAh! You may well sigh, Mrs.",
        "Mann!\u201d said the beadle.",
        "Finding she had done right, Mrs.",
        "Mann sighed again: evidently to the satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said, \u201cMrs.",
        "Mann, I am going to London.\u201d \u201cLauk, Mr.",
        "Bumble!\u201d cried Mrs.",

        "Bumble, drawing himself up, \u201cwhether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me.\u201d \u201cOh! you mustn\u2019t be too hard upon them, sir,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, coaxingly.",
        "\u201cThe Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble; \u201cand if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only themselves to thank.\u201d There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which Mr.",
        "Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.",
        "Mann appeared quite awed by them.",
        "At length she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s when they\u2019re ill, Mrs.",
        "Mann,\u201d said the beadle.",
        "\u201cWe put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking cold.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "\u201cThe opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cThey are both in a very low state, and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move \u2019em than to bury \u2019em\u2014that is, if we can throw \u2019em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if they don\u2019t die upon the road to spite us.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d When Mr.",
        "Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the cocked hat; and he became grave.",
        "\u201cWe are forgetting business, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle; \u201chere is your porochial stipend for the month.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his pocket book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs.",
        "Mann wrote.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s very much blotted, sir,\u201d said the farmer of infants; \u201cbut it\u2019s formal enough, I dare say.",
        "Thank you, Mr.",
        "Bumble, sir, I am very much obliged to you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs.",
        "Mann\u2019s curtsey; and inquired how the children were.",
        "\u201cBless their dear little hearts!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann with emotion, \u201cthey\u2019re as well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last week.",
        "And little Dick.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that boy no better?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "Mann shook her head.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s a ill conditioned, wicious, bad disposed porochial child that,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble angrily.",
        "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "\u201cHere, you Dick!\u201d After some calling, Dick was discovered.",
        "Having had his face put under the pump, and dried upon Mrs.",
        "Mann\u2019s gown, he was led into the awful presence of Mr.",
        "Bumble, the beadle.",
        "The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large and bright.",
        "The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like those of an old man.",
        "Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the beadle\u2019s voice.",
        "\u201cCan\u2019t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, porochial Dick?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Bumble, with well timed jocularity.",
        "\u201cNothing, sir,\u201d replied the child faintly.",
        "\u201cI should think not,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, who had of course laughed very much at Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s humour.",
        "\u201cYou want for nothing, I\u2019m sure.\u201d \u201cI should like\u2014\u201d faltered the child.",
        "\u201cHey day!\u201d interposed Mrs.",
        "Mann, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to say that you _do_ want for something, now? Why, you little wretch\u2014\u201d \u201cStop, Mrs.",
        "Mann, stop!\u201d said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of authority.",
        "\u201cLike what, sir, eh?\u201d \u201cI should like,\u201d faltered the child, \u201cif somebody that can write, would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.\u201d \u201cWhy, what does the boy mean?\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Bumble, on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as he was to such things.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI should like,\u201d said the child, \u201cto leave my dear love to poor Oliver Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him.",
        "And I should like to tell him,\u201d said the child pressing his small hands together, and speaking with great fervour, \u201cthat I was glad to die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, \u201cThey\u2019re all in one story, Mrs.",
        "Mann.",
        "That out dacious Oliver had demogalized them all!\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t have believed it, sir\u201d said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands, and looking malignantly at Dick.",
        "\u201cI never see such a hardened little wretch!\u201d \u201cTake him away, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble imperiously.",
        "\u201cThis must be stated to the board, Mrs.",
        "Mann.\u201d \u201cI hope the gentleman will understand that it isn\u2019t my fault, sir?\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Mann, whimpering pathetically.",
        "\u201cThey shall understand that, ma\u2019am; they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cThere; take him away, I can\u2019t bear the sight on him.\u201d Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal cellar.",
        "Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.",
        "At six o\u2019clock next morning, Mr.",
        "Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great coat with a cape to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time, he arrived in London.",
        "He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr.",
        "Bumble declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable; although he had a great coat on.",
        "Having disposed of these evil minded persons for the night, Mr.",
        "Bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter.",
        "Putting a glass of hot gin and water on the chimney piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too prevalent sin of discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.",
        "The very first paragraph upon which Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s eye rested, was the following advertisement.",
        "\u201cFIVE GUINEAS REWARD \u201cWhereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since been heard of.",
        "The above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.\u201d And then followed a full description of Oliver\u2019s dress, person, appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr.",
        "Brownlow at full length.",
        "Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of hot gin and water, untasted.",
        "\u201cIs Mr.",
        "Brownlow at home?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Bumble of the girl who opened the door.",
        "To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive reply of \u201cI don\u2019t know; where do you come from?\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver\u2019s name, in explanation of his errand, than Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened into the passage in a breathless state.",
        "\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d said the old lady: \u201cI knew we should hear of him.",
        "Poor dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it.",
        "Bless his heart! I said so all along.\u201d Having said this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears.",
        "The girl, who was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned with a request that Mr.",
        "Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did.",
        "He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr.",
        "Brownlow and his friend Mr.",
        "Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.",
        "The latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation: \u201cA beadle.",
        "A parish beadle, or I\u2019ll eat my head.\u201d \u201cPray don\u2019t interrupt just now,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cTake a seat, will you?\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.",
        "Grimwig\u2019s manner.",
        "Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadle\u2019s countenance; and said, with a little impatience, \u201cNow, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cAnd you _are_ a beadle, are you not?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cI am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble proudly.",
        "\u201cOf course,\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Grimwig aside to his friend, \u201cI knew he was.",
        "A beadle all over!\u201d Mr.",
        "Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and resumed: \u201cDo you know where this poor boy is now?\u201d \u201cNo more than nobody,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWell, what _do_ you know of him?\u201d inquired the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cSpeak out, my friend, if you have anything to say.",
        "What _do_ you know of him?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know any good of him, do you?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s features.",
        "Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with portentous solemnity.",
        "\u201cYou see?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s pursed up countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few words as possible.",
        "Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms; inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments\u2019 reflection, commenced his story.",
        "It would be tedious if given in the beadle\u2019s words: occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.",
        "That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude, and malice.",
        "That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night time from his master\u2019s house.",
        "In proof of his really being the person he represented himself, Mr.",
        "Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town.",
        "Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s observations.",
        "\u201cI fear it is all too true,\u201d said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after looking over the papers.",
        "\u201cThis is not much for your intelligence; but I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to the boy.\u201d It is not improbable that if Mr.",
        "Bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history.",
        "It was too late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.",
        "Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much disturbed by the beadle\u2019s tale, that even Mr.",
        "Grimwig forbore to vex him further.",
        "At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.",
        "\u201cMrs.",
        "Bedwin,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; \u201cthat boy, Oliver, is an imposter.\u201d \u201cIt can\u2019t be, sir.",
        "It cannot be,\u201d said the old lady energetically.",
        "\u201cI tell you he is,\u201d retorted the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean by can\u2019t be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has been a thorough paced little villain, all his life.\u201d \u201cI never will believe it, sir,\u201d replied the old lady, firmly.",
        "\u201cNever!\u201d \u201cYou old women never believe anything but quack doctors, and lying story books,\u201d growled Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cI knew it all along.",
        "Why didn\u2019t you take my advice in the beginning; you would if he hadn\u2019t had a fever, I suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn\u2019t he? Interesting! Bah!\u201d And Mr.",
        "Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.",
        "\u201cHe was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,\u201d retorted Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, indignantly.",
        "\u201cI know what children are, sir; and have done these forty years; and people who can\u2019t say the same, shouldn\u2019t say anything about them.",
        "That\u2019s my opinion!\u201d This was a hard hit at Mr.",
        "Grimwig, who was a bachelor.",
        "As it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was stopped by Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cSilence!\u201d said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from feeling.",
        "\u201cNever let me hear the boy\u2019s name again.",
        "I rang to tell you that.",
        "Never.",
        "Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs.",
        "Bedwin.",
        "Remember! I am in earnest.\u201d There were sad hearts at Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s that night.",
        "Oliver\u2019s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might have broken outright.",
        "CHAPTER XVIII.",
        "HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr.",
        "Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.",
        "Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.",
        "Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr.",
        "Fagin) and a few select friends.",
        "Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.",
        "Little Oliver\u2019s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew\u2019s words, and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.",
        "That it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that deeply laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or over communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and Mr.",
        "Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind.",
        "As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew\u2019s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.",
        "The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would be very good friends yet.",
        "Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with an old patched great coat, he went out, and locked the room door behind him.",
        "And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts.",
        "Which, never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.",
        "After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room door unlocked; and he was at liberty to wander about the house.",
        "It was a very dirty place.",
        "The rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimney pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways.",
        "From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as it looked now.",
        "Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.",
        "With these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned.",
        "In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows.",
        "There was a back garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable ends.",
        "Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver\u2019s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,\u2014which he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St.",
        "Paul\u2019s Cathedral.",
        "One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening, the first named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway.",
        "Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of this proposal.",
        "So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr.",
        "Dawkins designated as \u201cjapanning his trotter cases.\u201d The phrase, rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.",
        "Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.",
        "He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sigh, said, half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates: \u201cWhat a pity it is he isn\u2019t a prig!\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Master Charles Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him.\u201d The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.",
        "They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.",
        "\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t even know what a prig is?\u201d said the Dodger mournfully.",
        "\u201cI think I know that,\u201d replied Oliver, looking up.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a the\u2014; you\u2019re one, are you not?\u201d inquired Oliver, checking himself.",
        "\u201cI am,\u201d replied the Dodger.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d scorn to be anything else.\u201d Mr.",
        "Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary.",
        "\u201cI am,\u201d repeated the Dodger.",
        "\u201cSo\u2019s Charley.",
        "So\u2019s Fagin.",
        "So\u2019s Sikes.",
        "So\u2019s Nancy.",
        "So\u2019s Bet.",
        "So we all are, down to the dog.",
        "And he\u2019s the downiest one of the lot!\u201d \u201cAnd the least given to peaching,\u201d added Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t so much as bark in a witness box, for fear of committing himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without wittles for a fortnight,\u201d said the Dodger.",
        "\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d observed Charley.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s a rum dog.",
        "Don\u2019t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when he\u2019s in company!\u201d pursued the Dodger.",
        "\u201cWon\u2019t he growl at all, when he hears a fiddle playing! And don\u2019t he hate other dogs as ain\u2019t of his breed! Oh, no!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s an out and out Christian,\u201d said Charley.",
        "This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal\u2019s abilities, but it was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be out and out Christians, between whom, and Mr.",
        "Sikes\u2019 dog, there exist strong and singular points of resemblance.",
        "\u201cWell, well,\u201d said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings.",
        "\u201cThis hasn\u2019t got anything to do with young Green here.\u201d \u201cNo more it has,\u201d said Charley.",
        "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?\u201d \u201cAnd make your fortun\u2019 out of hand?\u201d added the Dodger, with a grin.",
        "\u201cAnd so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen teel: as I mean to, in the very next leap year but four that ever comes, and the forty second Tuesday in Trinity week,\u201d said Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d rejoined Oliver, timidly; \u201cI wish they would let me go.",
        "I\u2014I\u2014would rather go.\u201d \u201cAnd Fagin would _rather_ not!\u201d rejoined Charley.",
        "Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his boot cleaning.",
        "\u201cGo!\u201d exclaimed the Dodger.",
        "\u201cWhy, where\u2019s your spirit? Don\u2019t you take any pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your friends?\u201d \u201cOh, blow that!\u201d said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, \u201cthat\u2019s too mean; that is.\u201d \u201c_I_ couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.",
        "\u201cYou can leave your friends, though,\u201d said Oliver with a half smile; \u201cand let them be punished for what you did.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, \u201cThat was all out of consideration for Fagin, \u2019cause the traps know that we work together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn\u2019t made our lucky; that was the move, wasn\u2019t it, Charley?\u201d Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of Oliver\u2019s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes long.",
        "\u201cLook here!\u201d said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence.",
        "\u201cHere\u2019s a jolly life! What\u2019s the odds where it comes from? Here, catch hold; there\u2019s plenty more where they were took from.",
        "You won\u2019t, won\u2019t you? Oh, you precious flat!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s naughty, ain\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d inquired Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019ll come to be scragged, won\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cSomething in this way, old feller,\u201d said Charley.",
        "As he said it, Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s what it means,\u201d said Charley.",
        "\u201cLook how he stares, Jack! I never did see such prime company as that \u2019ere boy; he\u2019ll be the death of me, I know he will.\u201d Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve been brought up bad,\u201d said the Dodger, surveying his boots with much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them.",
        "\u201cFagin will make something of you, though, or you\u2019ll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable.",
        "You\u2019d better begin at once; for you\u2019ll come to the trade long before you think of it; and you\u2019re only losing time, Oliver.\u201d Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own: which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr.",
        "Dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin\u2019s favour without more delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.",
        "\u201cAnd always put this in your pipe, Nolly,\u201d said the Dodger, as the Jew was heard unlocking the door above, \u201cif you don\u2019t take fogels and tickers\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of talking in that way?\u201d interposed Master Bates; \u201che don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t take pocket handkechers and watches,\u201d said the Dodger, reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver\u2019s capacity, \u201csome other cove will; so that the coves that lose \u2019em will be all the worse, and you\u2019ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha\u2019p\u2019orth the better, except the chaps wot gets them\u2014and you\u2019ve just as good a right to them as they have.\u201d \u201cTo be sure, to be sure!\u201d said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver.",
        "\u201cIt all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger\u2019s word for it.",
        "Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his trade.\u201d The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the Dodger\u2019s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his pupil\u2019s proficiency.",
        "The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.",
        "Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements.",
        "He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron.",
        "His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his \u201ctime\u201d was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes.",
        "Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there was no remedy against the county.",
        "The same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be decidedly unlawful.",
        "Chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty two moral long hard working days; and that he \u201cwished he might be busted if he warn\u2019t as dry as a lime basket.\u201d \u201cWhere do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table.",
        "\u201cI\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at Oliver.",
        "\u201cA young friend of mine, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s in luck, then,\u201d said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.",
        "\u201cNever mind where I came from, young \u2019un; you\u2019ll find your way there, soon enough, I\u2019ll bet a crown!\u201d At this sally, the boys laughed.",
        "After some more jokes on the same subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.",
        "After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers.",
        "These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew himself.",
        "At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr.",
        "Chitling did the same: for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two.",
        "Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.",
        "From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver\u2019s, Mr.",
        "Fagin best knew.",
        "At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.",
        "In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils.",
        "Having prepared his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its hue for ever.",
        "CHAPTER XIX.",
        "IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den.",
        "He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could.",
        "The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel.",
        "The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields.",
        "The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch.",
        "It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad.",
        "As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.",
        "He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely populated quarter.",
        "The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way.",
        "He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end.",
        "At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.",
        "A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room door; and a man\u2019s voice demanded who was there.",
        "\u201cOnly me, Bill; only me, my dear,\u201d said the Jew looking in.",
        "\u201cBring in your body then,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cLie down, you stupid brute! Don\u2019t you know the devil when he\u2019s got a great coat on?\u201d Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr.",
        "Fagin\u2019s outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cWell, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.\u2014\u201cAh! Nancy.\u201d The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr.",
        "Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver.",
        "All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady\u2019s behaviour.",
        "She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake.",
        "\u201cIt _is_ cold, Nancy dear,\u201d said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire.",
        "\u201cIt seems to go right through one,\u201d added the old man, touching his side.",
        "\u201cIt must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "\u201cGive him something to drink, Nancy.",
        "Burn my body, make haste! It\u2019s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.\u201d Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids.",
        "Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.",
        "\u201cQuite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,\u201d replied the Jew, putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it.",
        "\u201cWhat! You\u2019re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.",
        "\u201cUgh!\u201d With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr.",
        "Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once.",
        "The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him.",
        "It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a \u201clife preserver\u201d that hung over the chimney piece.",
        "\u201cThere,\u201d said Sikes, smacking his lips.",
        "\u201cNow I\u2019m ready.\u201d \u201cFor business?\u201d inquired the Jew.",
        "\u201cFor business,\u201d replied Sikes; \u201cso say what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d \u201cAbout the crib at Chertsey, Bill?\u201d said the Jew, drawing his chair forward, and speaking in a very low voice.",
        "\u201cYes.",
        "Wot about it?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cAh! you know what I mean, my dear,\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cHe knows what I mean, Nancy; don\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cNo, he don\u2019t,\u201d sneered Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "\u201cOr he won\u2019t, and that\u2019s the same thing.",
        "Speak out, and call things by their right names; don\u2019t sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn\u2019t the very first that thought about the robbery.",
        "Wot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d \u201cHush, Bill, hush!\u201d said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation; \u201csomebody will hear us, my dear.",
        "Somebody will hear us.\u201d \u201cLet \u2019em hear!\u201d said Sikes; \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d But as Mr.",
        "Sikes _did_ care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer.",
        "\u201cThere, there,\u201d said the Jew, coaxingly.",
        "\u201cIt was only my caution, nothing more.",
        "Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done, Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such plate!\u201d said the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation.",
        "\u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Sikes coldly.",
        "\u201cNot to be done at all!\u201d echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.",
        "\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d rejoined Sikes.",
        "\u201cAt least it can\u2019t be a put up job, as we expected.\u201d \u201cThen it hasn\u2019t been properly gone about,\u201d said the Jew, turning pale with anger.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t tell me!\u201d \u201cBut I will tell you,\u201d retorted Sikes.",
        "\u201cWho are you that\u2019s not to be told? I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight, and he can\u2019t get one of the servants in line.\u201d \u201cDo you mean to tell me, Bill,\u201d said the Jew: softening as the other grew heated: \u201cthat neither of the two men in the house can be got over?\u201d \u201cYes, I do mean to tell you so,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cThe old lady has had \u2019em these twenty years; and if you were to give \u2019em five hundred pound, they wouldn\u2019t be in it.\u201d \u201cBut do you mean to say, my dear,\u201d remonstrated the Jew, \u201cthat the women can\u2019t be got over?\u201d \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cNot by flash Toby Crackit?\u201d said the Jew incredulously.",
        "\u201cThink what women are, Bill,\u201d \u201cNo; not even by flash Toby Crackit,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cHe says he\u2019s worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he\u2019s been loitering down there, and it\u2019s all of no use.\u201d \u201cHe should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my dear,\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cSo he did,\u201d rejoined Sikes, \u201cand they warn\u2019t of no more use than the other plant.\u201d The Jew looked blank at this information.",
        "After ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said, with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared the game was up.",
        "\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, \u201cit\u2019s a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "\u201cWorse luck!\u201d A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal.",
        "Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.",
        "Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.",
        "\u201cFagin,\u201d said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; \u201cis it worth fifty shiners extra, if it\u2019s safely done from the outside?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.",
        "\u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cYes, my dear, yes,\u201d rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened.",
        "\u201cThen,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew\u2019s hand, with some disdain, \u201clet it come off as soon as you like.",
        "Toby and me were over the garden wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and shutters.",
        "The crib\u2019s barred up at night like a jail; but there\u2019s one part we can crack, safe and softly.\u201d \u201cWhich is that, Bill?\u201d asked the Jew eagerly.",
        "\u201cWhy,\u201d whispered Sikes, \u201cas you cross the lawn\u2014\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost starting out of it.",
        "\u201cUmph!\u201d cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cNever mind which part it is.",
        "You can\u2019t do it without me, I know; but it\u2019s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.\u201d \u201cAs you like, my dear, as you like\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cIs there no help wanted, but yours and Toby\u2019s?\u201d \u201cNone,\u201d said Sikes, \u201c\u2019cept a centre bit and a boy.",
        "The first we\u2019ve both got; the second you must find us.\u201d \u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed the Jew.",
        "\u201cOh! then it\u2019s a panel, eh?\u201d \u201cNever mind wot it is!\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cI want a boy, and he musn\u2019t be a big \u2019un.",
        "Lord!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, reflectively, \u201cif I\u2019d only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley sweeper\u2019s! He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job.",
        "But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a \u2019prentice of him.",
        "And so they go on,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, \u201cso they go on; and, if they\u2019d got money enough (which it\u2019s a Providence they haven\u2019t,) we shouldn\u2019t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.\u201d \u201cNo more we should,\u201d acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence.",
        "\u201cBill!\u201d \u201cWhat now?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room.",
        "Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.",
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t want any beer,\u201d said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her seat very composedly.",
        "\u201cI tell you I do!\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cNonsense,\u201d rejoined the girl coolly, \u201cGo on, Fagin.",
        "I know what he\u2019s going to say, Bill; he needn\u2019t mind me.\u201d The Jew still hesitated.",
        "Sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise.",
        "\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?\u201d he asked at length.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil\u2019s in it.",
        "She ain\u2019t one to blab.",
        "Are you Nancy?\u201d \u201c_I_ should think not!\u201d replied the young lady: drawing her chair up to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.",
        "\u201cNo, no, my dear, I know you\u2019re not,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cbut\u2014\u201d and again the old man paused.",
        "\u201cBut wot?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether she mightn\u2019t p\u2019r\u2019aps be out of sorts, you know, my dear, as she was the other night,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into sundry exclamations of \u201cKeep the game a going!\u201d \u201cNever say die!\u201d and the like.",
        "These seemed to have the effect of re assuring both gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did Mr.",
        "Sikes likewise.",
        "\u201cNow, Fagin,\u201d said Nancy with a laugh.",
        "\u201cTell Bill at once, about Oliver!\u201d \u201cHa! you\u2019re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!\u201d said the Jew, patting her on the neck.",
        "\u201cIt _was_ about Oliver I was going to speak, sure enough.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d \u201cWhat about him?\u201d demanded Sikes.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s the boy for you, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper; laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.",
        "\u201cHe!\u201d exclaimed Sikes.",
        "\u201cHave him, Bill!\u201d said Nancy.",
        "\u201cI would, if I was in your place.",
        "He mayn\u2019t be so much up, as any of the others; but that\u2019s not what you want, if he\u2019s only to open a door for you.",
        "Depend upon it he\u2019s a safe one, Bill.\u201d \u201cI know he is,\u201d rejoined Fagin.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s been in good training these last few weeks, and it\u2019s time he began to work for his bread.",
        "Besides, the others are all too big.\u201d \u201cWell, he is just the size I want,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, ruminating.",
        "\u201cAnd will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,\u201d interposed the Jew; \u201che can\u2019t help himself.",
        "That is, if you frighten him enough.\u201d \u201cFrighten him!\u201d echoed Sikes.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019ll be no sham frightening, mind you.",
        "If there\u2019s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a penny, in for a pound.",
        "You won\u2019t see him alive again, Fagin.",
        "Think of that, before you send him.",
        "Mark my words!\u201d said the robber, poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it all,\u201d said the Jew with energy.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve had my eye upon him, my dears, close\u2014close.",
        "Once let him feel that he is one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and he\u2019s ours! Ours for his life.",
        "Oho! It couldn\u2019t have come about better!\u201d The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.",
        "\u201cOurs!\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cYours, you mean.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I do, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle.",
        "\u201cMine, if you like, Bill.\u201d \u201cAnd wot,\u201d said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, \u201cwot makes you take so much pains about one chalk faced kid, when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you might pick and choose from?\u201d \u201cBecause they\u2019re of no use to me, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, with some confusion, \u201cnot worth the taking.",
        "Their looks convict \u2019em when they get into trouble, and I lose \u2019em all.",
        "With this boy, properly managed, my dears, I could do what I couldn\u2019t with twenty of them.",
        "Besides,\u201d said the Jew, recovering his self possession, \u201che has us now if he could only give us leg bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us.",
        "Never mind how he came there; it\u2019s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery; that\u2019s all I want.",
        "Now, how much better this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way\u2014which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.\u201d \u201cWhen is it to be done?\u201d asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of Mr.",
        "Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received Fagin\u2019s affectation of humanity.",
        "\u201cAh, to be sure,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cwhen is it to be done, Bill?\u201d \u201cI planned with Toby, the night arter tomorrow,\u201d rejoined Sikes in a surly voice, \u201cif he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cthere\u2019s no moon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d rejoined Sikes.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?\u201d asked the Jew.",
        "Sikes nodded.",
        "\u201cAnd about\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, ah, it\u2019s all planned,\u201d rejoined Sikes, interrupting him.",
        "\u201cNever mind particulars.",
        "You\u2019d better bring the boy here tomorrow night.",
        "I shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.",
        "Then you hold your tongue, and keep the melting pot ready, and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll have to do.\u201d After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew\u2019s next evening when the night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf, than anybody else.",
        "It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr.",
        "William Sikes; and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by Mr.",
        "Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.",
        "These preliminaries adjusted, Mr.",
        "Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with wild execrations.",
        "At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.",
        "\u201cGood night, Nancy,\u201d said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.",
        "\u201cGood night.\u201d Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly.",
        "There was no flinching about the girl.",
        "She was as true and earnest in the matter as Toby Crackit himself could be.",
        "The Jew again bade her good night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of Mr.",
        "Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs.",
        "\u201cAlways the way!\u201d muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.",
        "\u201cThe worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some long forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts.",
        "Ha! ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!\u201d Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr.",
        "Fagin wended his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.",
        "\u201cIs Oliver a bed? I want to speak to him,\u201d was his first remark as they descended the stairs.",
        "\u201cHours ago,\u201d replied the Dodger, throwing open a door.",
        "\u201cHere he is!\u201d The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.",
        "\u201cNot now,\u201d said the Jew, turning softly away.",
        "\u201cTomorrow.",
        "Tomorrow.\u201d CHAPTER XX.",
        "WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR.",
        "WILLIAM SIKES When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed.",
        "At first, he was pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night.",
        "\u201cTo\u2014to\u2014stop there, sir?\u201d asked Oliver, anxiously.",
        "\u201cNo, no, my dear.",
        "Not to stop there,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t like to lose you.",
        "Don\u2019t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again.",
        "Ha! ha! ha! We won\u2019t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.",
        "Oh no, no!\u201d The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread, looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.",
        "\u201cI suppose,\u201d said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, \u201cyou want to know what you\u2019re going to Bill\u2019s for\u2014eh, my dear?\u201d Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.",
        "\u201cWhy, do you think?\u201d inquired Fagin, parrying the question.",
        "\u201cIndeed I don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cBah!\u201d said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boy\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cWait till Bill tells you, then.\u201d The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver\u2019s not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin\u2019s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then.",
        "He had no other opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when he prepared to go abroad.",
        "\u201cYou may burn a candle,\u201d said the Jew, putting one upon the table.",
        "\u201cAnd here\u2019s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.",
        "Good night!\u201d \u201cGood night!\u201d replied Oliver, softly.",
        "The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went.",
        "Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.",
        "Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light it.",
        "He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.",
        "\u201cTake heed, Oliver! take heed!\u201d said the old man, shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s a rough man, and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up.",
        "Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he bids you.",
        "Mind!\u201d Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.",
        "Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.",
        "The more he thought of the Jew\u2019s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning.",
        "He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes, which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged.",
        "He was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.",
        "He remained lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read.",
        "He turned over the leaves.",
        "Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume.",
        "It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use.",
        "Here, he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.",
        "Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs quail, to think of.",
        "The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.",
        "In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.",
        "Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for crimes, so fearful and appalling.",
        "By degrees, he grew more calm, and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt.",
        "He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s that!\u201d he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure standing by the door.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cMe.",
        "Only me,\u201d replied a tremulous voice.",
        "Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.",
        "It was Nancy.",
        "\u201cPut down the light,\u201d said the girl, turning away her head.",
        "\u201cIt hurts my eyes.\u201d Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.",
        "The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung her hands; but made no reply.",
        "\u201cGod forgive me!\u201d she cried after a while, \u201cI never thought of this.\u201d \u201cHas anything happened?\u201d asked Oliver.",
        "\u201cCan I help you? I will if I can.",
        "I will, indeed.\u201d She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling sound, gasped for breath.",
        "\u201cNancy!\u201d cried Oliver, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold.",
        "Oliver stirred the fire.",
        "Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and looked round.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes over me sometimes,\u201d said she, affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress; \u201cit\u2019s this damp dirty room, I think.",
        "Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?\u201d \u201cAm I to go with you?\u201d asked Oliver.",
        "\u201cYes.",
        "I have come from Bill,\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cYou are to go with me.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Oliver, recoiling.",
        "\u201cWhat for?\u201d echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again, the moment they encountered the boy\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cOh! For no harm.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Oliver: who had watched her closely.",
        "\u201cHave it your own way,\u201d rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh.",
        "\u201cFor no good, then.\u201d Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl\u2019s better feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state.",
        "But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven o\u2019clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale.",
        "As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.",
        "Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his companion.",
        "She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round.",
        "\u201cYou can\u2019t help yourself.",
        "I have tried hard for you, but all to no purpose.",
        "You are hedged round and round.",
        "If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.\u201d Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with great surprise.",
        "She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.",
        "\u201cI have saved you from being ill used once, and I will again, and I do now,\u201d continued the girl aloud; \u201cfor those who would have fetched you, if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.",
        "I have promised for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.",
        "See here! I have borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.\u201d She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and continued, with great rapidity: \u201cRemember this! And don\u2019t let me suffer more for you, just now.",
        "If I could help you, I would; but I have not the power.",
        "They don\u2019t mean to harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours.",
        "Hush! Every word from you is a blow for me.",
        "Give me your hand.",
        "Make haste! Your hand!\u201d She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and, blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs.",
        "The door was opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly closed, when they had passed out.",
        "A hackney cabriolet was in waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.",
        "The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an instant.",
        "The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted.",
        "All was so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the Jew\u2019s steps had been directed on the previous evening.",
        "For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.",
        "But the girl\u2019s voice was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had not the heart to utter it.",
        "While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was shut.",
        "\u201cThis way,\u201d said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.",
        "\u201cBill!\u201d \u201cHallo!\u201d replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a candle.",
        "\u201cOh! That\u2019s the time of day.",
        "Come on!\u201d This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty welcome, from a person of Mr.",
        "Sikes\u2019 temperament.",
        "Nancy, appearing much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.",
        "\u201cBull\u2019s eye\u2019s gone home with Tom,\u201d observed Sikes, as he lighted them up.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019d have been in the way.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d rejoined Nancy.",
        "\u201cSo you\u2019ve got the kid,\u201d said Sikes when they had all reached the room: closing the door as he spoke.",
        "\u201cYes, here he is,\u201d replied Nancy.",
        "\u201cDid he come quiet?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cLike a lamb,\u201d rejoined Nancy.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; \u201cfor the sake of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it.",
        "Come here, young \u2019un; and let me read you a lectur\u2019, which is as well got over at once.\u201d Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr.",
        "Sikes pulled off Oliver\u2019s cap and threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.",
        "\u201cNow, first: do you know wot this is?\u201d inquired Sikes, taking up a pocket pistol which lay on the table.",
        "Oliver replied in the affirmative.",
        "\u201cWell, then, look here,\u201d continued Sikes.",
        "\u201cThis is powder; that \u2019ere\u2019s a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin\u2019.\u201d Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and Mr.",
        "Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and deliberation.",
        "\u201cNow it\u2019s loaded,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes, when he had finished.",
        "\u201cYes, I see it is, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the robber, grasping Oliver\u2019s wrist, and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could not repress a start; \u201cif you speak a word when you\u2019re out o\u2019doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without notice.",
        "So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak without leave, say your prayers first.\u201d Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its effect, Mr.",
        "Sikes continued.",
        "\u201cAs near as I know, there isn\u2019t anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn\u2019t take this devil and all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn\u2019t for your own good.",
        "D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d \u201cThe short and the long of what you mean,\u201d said Nancy: speaking very emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words: \u201cis, that if you\u2019re crossed by him in this job you have on hand, you\u2019ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every month of your life.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Sikes, approvingly; \u201cwomen can always put things in fewest words.\u2014Except when it\u2019s blowing up; and then they lengthens it out.",
        "And now that he\u2019s thoroughly up to it, let\u2019s have some supper, and get a snooze before starting.\u201d In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheep\u2019s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr.",
        "Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of \u201cjemmies\u201d being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession.",
        "Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than four score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.",
        "Supper being ended\u2014it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great appetite for it\u2014Mr.",
        "Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.",
        "Oliver stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.",
        "For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim the light.",
        "Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep.",
        "When he awoke, the table was covered with tea things, and Sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great coat, which hung over the back of a chair.",
        "Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast.",
        "It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was quite dark outside.",
        "A sharp rain, too, was beating against the window panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.",
        "\u201cNow, then!\u201d growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; \u201chalf past five! Look sharp, or you\u2019ll get no breakfast; for it\u2019s late as it is.\u201d Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready.",
        "Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders.",
        "Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side pocket of his great coat, clasped it firmly in his, and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.",
        "Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of meeting a look from the girl.",
        "But she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.",
        "CHAPTER XXI.",
        "THE EXPEDITION It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.",
        "The night had been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels were overflowing.",
        "There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house tops, and dreary streets.",
        "There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were noiseless and empty.",
        "By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had fairly begun to break.",
        "Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a stage coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time.",
        "The public houses, with gas lights burning inside, were already open.",
        "By degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with.",
        "Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with fish baskets on their heads; donkey carts laden with vegetables; chaise carts filled with live stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk women with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town.",
        "As they approached the City, the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle.",
        "It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.",
        "Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square, Mr.",
        "Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.",
        "It was market morning.",
        "The ground was covered, nearly ankle deep, with filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the chimney tops, hung heavily above.",
        "All the pens in the centre of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.",
        "Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every public house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confounded the senses.",
        "Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.",
        "He nodded, twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn.",
        "\u201cNow, young \u2019un!\u201d said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St.",
        "Andrew\u2019s Church, \u201chard upon seven! you must step out.",
        "Come, don\u2019t lag behind already, Lazy legs!\u201d Mr.",
        "Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion\u2019s wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house breaker as well as he could.",
        "They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up.",
        "Seeing \u201cHounslow\u201d written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth.",
        "\u201cJump up,\u201d said the man.",
        "\u201cIs that your boy?\u201d \u201cYes; he\u2019s my boy,\u201d replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.",
        "\u201cYour father walks rather too quick for you, don\u2019t he, my man?\u201d inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.",
        "\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Sikes, interposing.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s used to it.",
        "Here, take hold of my hand, Ned.",
        "In with you!\u201d Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver, pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself.",
        "As they passed the different mile stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him.",
        "Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey.",
        "At length, they came to a public house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off.",
        "And here, the cart stopped.",
        "Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon him, and rapped the side pocket with his fist, in a significant manner.",
        "\u201cGood bye, boy,\u201d said the man.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s sulky,\u201d replied Sikes, giving him a shake; \u201che\u2019s sulky.",
        "A young dog! Don\u2019t mind him.\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d rejoined the other, getting into his cart.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a fine day, after all.\u201d And he drove away.",
        "Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey.",
        "They turned round to the left, a short way past the public house; and then, taking a right hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many large gardens and gentlemen\u2019s houses on both sides of the way, and stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town.",
        "Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large letters, \u201cHampton.\u201d They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours.",
        "At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public house with a defaced sign board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.",
        "The kitchen was an old, low roofed room; with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock frocks, drinking and smoking.",
        "They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company.",
        "They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.",
        "Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further.",
        "Being much tired with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.",
        "It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes.",
        "Rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of ale.",
        "\u201cSo, you\u2019re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?\u201d inquired Sikes.",
        "\u201cYes, I am,\u201d replied the man, who seemed a little the worse\u2014or better, as the case might be\u2014for drinking; \u201cand not slow about it neither.",
        "My horse hasn\u2019t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in the mornin\u2019; and he won\u2019t be long a doing of it.",
        "Here\u2019s luck to him.",
        "Ecod! he\u2019s a good \u2019un!\u201d \u201cCould you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?\u201d demanded Sikes, pushing the ale towards his new friend.",
        "\u201cIf you\u2019re going directly, I can,\u201d replied the man, looking out of the pot.",
        "\u201cAre you going to Halliford?\u201d \u201cGoing on to Shepperton,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m your man, as far as I go,\u201d replied the other.",
        "\u201cIs all paid, Becky?\u201d \u201cYes, the other gentleman\u2019s paid,\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cI say!\u201d said the man, with tipsy gravity; \u201cthat won\u2019t do, you know.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d rejoined Sikes.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a going to accommodate us, and wot\u2019s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?\u201d The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face; having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real good fellow.",
        "To which Mr.",
        "Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.",
        "After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company good night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the party start.",
        "The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing outside: ready harnessed to the cart.",
        "Oliver and Sikes got in without any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two \u201cto bear him up,\u201d and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal, mounted also.",
        "Then, the hostler was told to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind legs, he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly.",
        "The night was very dark.",
        "A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields.",
        "It was piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black.",
        "Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation.",
        "Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.",
        "As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven.",
        "There was a light in the ferry house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew tree with graves beneath it.",
        "There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind.",
        "It seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead.",
        "Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.",
        "Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped.",
        "Sikes alighted, took Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.",
        "They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance.",
        "On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge.",
        "Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.",
        "\u201cThe water!\u201d thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.",
        "\u201cHe has brought me to this lonely place to murder me!\u201d He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all ruinous and decayed.",
        "There was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.",
        "The house was dark, dismantled: and, to all appearance, uninhabited.",
        "Sikes, with Oliver\u2019s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch.",
        "The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in together.",
        "CHAPTER XXII.",
        "THE BURGLARY \u201cHallo!\u201d cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the passage.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t make such a row,\u201d said Sikes, bolting the door.",
        "\u201cShow a glim, Toby.\u201d \u201cAha! my pal!\u201d cried the same voice.",
        "\u201cA glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.\u201d The speaker appeared to throw a boot jack, or some such article, at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.",
        "\u201cDo you hear?\u201d cried the same voice.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s Bill Sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.",
        "Are you any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?\u201d A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the public house on Saffron Hill.",
        "\u201cBister Sikes!\u201d exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; \u201ccub id, sir; cub id.\u201d \u201cHere! you get on first,\u201d said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.",
        "\u201cQuicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.\u201d Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay pipe.",
        "He was dressed in a smartly cut snuff coloured coat, with large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.",
        "Crackit (for he it was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common rings.",
        "He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his top boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.",
        "\u201cBill, my boy!\u201d said this figure, turning his head towards the door, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you.",
        "I was almost afraid you\u2019d given it up: in which case I should have made a personal wentur.",
        "Hallo!\u201d Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested on Oliver, Mr.",
        "Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and demanded who that was.",
        "\u201cThe boy.",
        "Only the boy!\u201d replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire.",
        "\u201cWud of Bister Fagid\u2019s lads,\u201d exclaimed Barney, with a grin.",
        "\u201cFagin\u2019s, eh!\u201d exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.",
        "\u201cWot an inwalable boy that\u2019ll make, for the old ladies\u2019 pockets in chapels! His mug is a fortin\u2019 to him.\u201d \u201cThere\u2014there\u2019s enough of that,\u201d interposed Sikes, impatiently; and stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear: at which Mr.",
        "Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long stare of astonishment.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, \u201cif you\u2019ll give us something to eat and drink while we\u2019re waiting, you\u2019ll put some heart in us; or in me, at all events.",
        "Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for you\u2019ll have to go out with us again tonight, though not very far off.\u201d Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarcely knowing where he was, or what was passing around him.",
        "\u201cHere,\u201d said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a bottle upon the table, \u201cSuccess to the crack!\u201d He rose to honour the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents.",
        "Sikes did the same.",
        "\u201cA drain for the boy,\u201d said Toby, half filling a wine glass.",
        "\u201cDown with it, innocence.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man\u2019s face; \u201cindeed, I\u2014\u201d \u201cDown with it!\u201d echoed Toby.",
        "\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.\u201d \u201cHe had better!\u201d said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket.",
        "\u201cBurn my body, if he isn\u2019t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers.",
        "Drink it, you perwerse imp; drink it!\u201d Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a smile from the surly Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.",
        "Oliver retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the floor: close outside the fender.",
        "They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire.",
        "Oliver fell into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and declaring it was half past one.",
        "In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively engaged in busy preparation.",
        "Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great coats; Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily crammed into the pockets.",
        "\u201cBarkers for me, Barney,\u201d said Toby Crackit.",
        "\u201cHere they are,\u201d replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols.",
        "\u201cYou loaded them yourself.\u201d \u201cAll right!\u201d replied Toby, stowing them away.",
        "\u201cThe persuaders?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got \u2019em,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cCrape, keys, centre bits, darkies\u2014nothing forgotten?\u201d inquired Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.",
        "\u201cAll right,\u201d rejoined his companion.",
        "\u201cBring them bits of timber, Barney.",
        "That\u2019s the time of day.\u201d With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney\u2019s hands, who, having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver\u2019s cape.",
        "\u201cNow then!\u201d said Sikes, holding out his hand.",
        "Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.",
        "\u201cTake his other hand, Toby,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cLook out, Barney.\u201d The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.",
        "The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them.",
        "Barney, having made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.",
        "It was now intensely dark.",
        "The fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that, although no rain fell, Oliver\u2019s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half frozen moisture that was floating about.",
        "They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before.",
        "They were at no great distance off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.",
        "\u201cSlap through the town,\u201d whispered Sikes; \u201cthere\u2019ll be nobody in the way, tonight, to see us.\u201d Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.",
        "A dim light shone at intervals from some bed room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night.",
        "But there was nobody abroad.",
        "They had cleared the town, as the church bell struck two.",
        "Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand.",
        "After walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.",
        "\u201cThe boy next,\u201d said Toby.",
        "\u201cHoist him up; I\u2019ll catch hold of him.\u201d Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the other side.",
        "Sikes followed directly.",
        "And they stole cautiously towards the house.",
        "And now, for the first time, Oliver, well nigh mad with grief and terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the expedition.",
        "He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.",
        "A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his knees.",
        "\u201cGet up!\u201d murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from his pocket; \u201cGet up, or I\u2019ll strew your brains upon the grass.\u201d \u201cOh! for God\u2019s sake let me go!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201clet me run away and die in the fields.",
        "I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.",
        "For the love of all the bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!\u201d The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand upon the boy\u2019s mouth, and dragged him to the house.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d cried the man; \u201cit won\u2019t answer here.",
        "Say another word, and I\u2019ll do your business myself with a crack on the head.",
        "That makes no noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.",
        "Here, Bill, wrench the shutter open.",
        "He\u2019s game enough now, I\u2019ll engage.",
        "I\u2019ve seen older hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.\u201d Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin\u2019s head for sending Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise.",
        "After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he had referred, swung open on its hinges.",
        "It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small brewing place, at the end of the passage.",
        "The aperture was so small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver\u2019s size, nevertheless.",
        "A very brief exercise of Mr.",
        "Sike\u2019s art, sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also.",
        "\u201cNow listen, you young limb,\u201d whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver\u2019s face; \u201cI\u2019m a going to put you through there.",
        "Take this light; go softly up the steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and let us in.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a bolt at the top, you won\u2019t be able to reach,\u201d interposed Toby.",
        "\u201cStand upon one of the hall chairs.",
        "There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on \u2019em: which is the old lady\u2019s arms.\u201d \u201cKeep quiet, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes, with a threatening look.",
        "\u201cThe room door is open, is it?\u201d \u201cWide,\u201d replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself.",
        "\u201cThe game of that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog, who\u2019s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful.",
        "Ha! ha! Barney \u2019ticed him away tonight.",
        "So neat!\u201d Although Mr.",
        "Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to work.",
        "Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of his back.",
        "This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside.",
        "\u201cTake this lantern,\u201d said Sikes, looking into the room.",
        "\u201cYou see the stairs afore you?\u201d Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, \u201cYes.\u201d Sikes, pointing to the street door with the pistol barrel, briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would fall dead that instant.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s done in a minute,\u201d said Sikes, in the same low whisper.",
        "\u201cDirectly I leave go of you, do your work.",
        "Hark!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d whispered the other man.",
        "They listened intently.",
        "\u201cNothing,\u201d said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.",
        "\u201cNow!\u201d In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family.",
        "Filled with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.",
        "\u201cCome back!\u201d suddenly cried Sikes aloud.",
        "\u201cBack! back!\u201d Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not whether to advance or fly.",
        "The cry was repeated\u2014a light appeared\u2014a vision of two terrified half dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes\u2014a flash\u2014a loud noise\u2014a smoke\u2014a crash somewhere, but where he knew not,\u2014and he staggered back.",
        "Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.",
        "He fired his own pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up.",
        "\u201cClasp your arm tighter,\u201d said Sikes, as he drew him through the window.",
        "\u201cGive me a shawl here.",
        "They\u2019ve hit him.",
        "Quick! How the boy bleeds!\u201d Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace.",
        "And then, the noises grew confused in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy\u2019s heart; and he saw or heard no more.",
        "CHAPTER XXIII.",
        "WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR.",
        "BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS The night was bitter cold.",
        "The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in air.",
        "Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die.",
        "Many hunger worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a more bitter world.",
        "Such was the aspect of out of doors affairs, when Mrs.",
        "Corney, the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy.",
        "In fact, Mrs.",
        "Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea.",
        "As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently increased,\u2014so much so, indeed, that Mrs.",
        "Corney smiled.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking reflectively at the fire; \u201cI\u2019m sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it.",
        "Ah!\u201d Mrs.",
        "Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two ounce tin tea caddy, proceeded to make the tea.",
        "How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.",
        "Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs.",
        "Corney\u2019s hand.",
        "\u201cDrat the pot!\u201d said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on the hob; \u201ca little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What use is it of, to anybody! Except,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Corney, pausing, \u201cexcept to a poor desolate creature like me.",
        "Oh dear!\u201d With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate.",
        "The small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of Mr.",
        "Corney (who had not been dead more than five and twenty years); and she was overpowered.",
        "\u201cI shall never get another!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Corney, pettishly; \u201cI shall never get another\u2014like him.\u201d Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is uncertain.",
        "It might have been the latter; for Mrs.",
        "Corney looked at it as she spoke; and took it up afterwards.",
        "She had just tasted her first cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door.",
        "\u201cOh, come in with you!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Corney, sharply.",
        "\u201cSome of the old women dying, I suppose.",
        "They always die when I\u2019m at meals.",
        "Don\u2019t stand there, letting the cold air in, don\u2019t.",
        "What\u2019s amiss now, eh?\u201d \u201cNothing, ma\u2019am, nothing,\u201d replied a man\u2019s voice.",
        "\u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, \u201cis that Mr.",
        "Bumble?\u201d \u201cAt your service, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other.",
        "\u201cShall I shut the door, ma\u2019am?\u201d The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with Mr.",
        "Bumble, with closed doors.",
        "Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it without permission.",
        "\u201cHard weather, Mr.",
        "Bumble,\u201d said the matron.",
        "\u201cHard, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the beadle.",
        "\u201cAnti porochial weather this, ma\u2019am.",
        "We have given away, Mrs.",
        "Corney, we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.\u201d \u201cOf course not.",
        "When would they be, Mr.",
        "Bumble?\u201d said the matron, sipping her tea.",
        "\u201cWhen, indeed, ma\u2019am!\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWhy here\u2019s one man that, in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese, full weight.",
        "Is he grateful, ma\u2019am? Is he grateful? Not a copper farthing\u2019s worth of it! What does he do, ma\u2019am, but ask for a few coals; if it\u2019s only a pocket handkerchief full, he says! Coals! What would he do with coals? Toast his cheese with \u2019em and then come back for more.",
        "That\u2019s the way with these people, ma\u2019am; give \u2019em a apron full of coals today, and they\u2019ll come back for another, the day after tomorrow, as brazen as alabaster.\u201d The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile; and the beadle went on.",
        "\u201cI never,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, \u201csee anything like the pitch it\u2019s got to.",
        "The day afore yesterday, a man\u2014you have been a married woman, ma\u2019am, and I may mention it to you\u2014a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs.",
        "Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer\u2019s door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs.",
        "Corney.",
        "As he wouldn\u2019t go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal.",
        "\u2018My heart!\u2019 says the ungrateful villain, \u2018what\u2019s the use of _this_ to me? You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!\u2019 \u2018Very good,\u2019 says our overseer, taking \u2019em away again, \u2018you won\u2019t get anything else here.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll die in the streets!\u2019 says the vagrant.",
        "\u2018Oh no, you won\u2019t,\u2019 says our overseer.\u201d \u201cHa! ha! That was very good! So like Mr.",
        "Grannett, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d interposed the matron.",
        "\u201cWell, Mr.",
        "Bumble?\u201d \u201cWell, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined the beadle, \u201che went away; and he _did_ die in the streets.",
        "There\u2019s a obstinate pauper for you!\u201d \u201cIt beats anything I could have believed,\u201d observed the matron emphatically.",
        "\u201cBut don\u2019t you think out of door relief a very bad thing, any way, Mr.",
        "Bumble? You\u2019re a gentleman of experience, and ought to know.",
        "Come.\u201d \u201cMrs.",
        "Corney,\u201d said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information, \u201cout of door relief, properly managed: properly managed, ma\u2019am: is the porochial safeguard.",
        "The great principle of out of door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don\u2019t want; and then they get tired of coming.\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed Mrs.",
        "Corney.",
        "\u201cWell, that is a good one, too!\u201d \u201cYes.",
        "Betwixt you and me, ma\u2019am,\u201d returned Mr.",
        "Bumble, \u201cthat\u2019s the great principle; and that\u2019s the reason why, if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers, you\u2019ll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.",
        "That\u2019s the rule now, Mrs.",
        "Corney, all over the country.",
        "But, however,\u201d said the beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, \u201cthese are official secrets, ma\u2019am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.",
        "This is the port wine, ma\u2019am, that the board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!\u201d Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test its excellence, Mr.",
        "Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ll have a very cold walk, Mr.",
        "Bumble,\u201d said the matron.",
        "\u201cIt blows, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, turning up his coat collar, \u201cenough to cut one\u2019s ears off.\u201d The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her good night, bashfully inquired whether\u2014whether he wouldn\u2019t take a cup of tea? Mr.",
        "Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.",
        "As he slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.",
        "She fixed her eyes upon the little teapot.",
        "Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.",
        "Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet.",
        "As she sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea.",
        "Again Mr.",
        "Bumble coughed\u2014louder this time than he had coughed yet.",
        "\u201cSweet? Mr.",
        "Bumble?\u201d inquired the matron, taking up the sugar basin.",
        "\u201cVery sweet, indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "He fixed his eyes on Mrs.",
        "Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.",
        "Bumble was that beadle at that moment.",
        "The tea was made, and handed in silence.",
        "Bumble, having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.",
        "\u201cYou have a cat, ma\u2019am, I see,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, glancing at one who, in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; \u201cand kittens too, I declare!\u201d \u201cI am so fond of them, Mr.",
        "Bumble, you can\u2019t think,\u201d replied the matron.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that they are quite companions for me.\u201d \u201cVery nice animals, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, approvingly; \u201cso very domestic.\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u201d rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; \u201cso fond of their home too, that it\u2019s quite a pleasure, I\u2019m sure.\u201d \u201cMrs.",
        "Corney, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with his teaspoon, \u201cI mean to say this, ma\u2019am; that any cat, or kitten, that could live with you, ma\u2019am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be a ass, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cOh, Mr.",
        "Bumble!\u201d remonstrated Mrs.",

        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cHard?\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble resigned his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs.",
        "Corney\u2019s little finger as she took it; and inflicting two open handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.",
        "It was a round table; and as Mrs.",
        "Corney and Mr.",
        "Bumble had been sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr.",
        "Bumble, in receding from the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and Mrs.",
        "Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s part: he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all.",
        "Whatever were Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr.",
        "Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.",
        "Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr.",
        "Bumble stopped.",
        "Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr.",

        "\u201cHard hearted, Mrs.",
        "Corney?\u201d said Mr.",

        "Corney?\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d exclaimed the matron, \u201cwhat a very curious question from a single man.",
        "What can you want to know for, Mr.",
        "Bumble?\u201d The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast; whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed the matron.",
        "Bumble!\u201d cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so great, that she had quite lost her voice, \u201cMr.",
        "Bumble, I shall scream!\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm round the matron\u2019s waist.",
        "As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner heard, than Mr.",
        "Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded who was there.",
        "It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.",
        "\u201cIf you please, mistress,\u201d said a withered old female pauper, hideously ugly: putting her head in at the door, \u201cOld Sally is a going fast.\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019s that to me?\u201d angrily demanded the matron.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t keep her alive, can I?\u201d \u201cNo, no, mistress,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cnobody can; she\u2019s far beyond the reach of help.",
        "I\u2019ve seen a many people die; little babes and great strong men; and I know when death\u2019s a coming, well enough.",
        "But she\u2019s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,\u2014and that\u2019s not often, for she is dying very hard,\u2014she says she has got something to tell, which you must hear.",
        "She\u2019ll never die quiet till you come, mistress.\u201d At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs.",
        "Corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldn\u2019t even die without purposely annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr.",
        "Bumble to stay till she came back, lest anything particular should occur.",
        "Bidding the messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.",
        "Bumble\u2019s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.",
        "He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar tongs, closely inspected a silver milk pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat corner wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table.",
        "Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture.",

        "TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT, BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the matron\u2019s room.",
        "Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature\u2019s hand.",
        "Alas! How few of Nature\u2019s faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave Heaven\u2019s surface clear.",
        "It is a common thing for the countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the long forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin\u2019s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.",
        "The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.",
        "It was a bare garret room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.",
        "There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary\u2019s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.",
        "\u201cCold night, Mrs.",
        "Corney,\u201d said this young gentleman, as the matron entered.",
        "\u201cVery cold, indeed, sir,\u201d replied the mistress, in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.",
        "\u201cYou should get better coals out of your contractors,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker; \u201cthese are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re the board\u2019s choosing, sir,\u201d returned the matron.",
        "\u201cThe least they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard enough.\u201d The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.",
        "\u201cOh!\u201d said the young man, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient, \u201cit\u2019s all U.P.",
        "there, Mrs.",
        "Corney.\u201d \u201cIt is, is it, sir?\u201d asked the matron.",
        "\u201cIf she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,\u201d said the apothecary\u2019s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick\u2019s point.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a break up of the system altogether.",
        "Is she dozing, old lady?\u201d The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the affirmative.",
        "\u201cThen perhaps she\u2019ll go off in that way, if you don\u2019t make a row,\u201d said the young man.",
        "\u201cPut the light on the floor.",
        "She won\u2019t see it there.\u201d The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned.",
        "The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.",
        "The apothecary\u2019s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs.",
        "Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.",
        "When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to catch the heat.",
        "The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began to converse in a low voice.",
        "\u201cDid she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?\u201d inquired the messenger.",
        "\u201cNot a word,\u201d replied the other.",
        "\u201cShe plucked and tore at her arms for a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off.",
        "She hasn\u2019t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet.",
        "I ain\u2019t so weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!\u201d \u201cDid she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?\u201d demanded the first.",
        "\u201cI tried to get it down,\u201d rejoined the other.",
        "\u201cBut her teeth were tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to get it back again.",
        "So _I_ drank it; and it did me good!\u201d Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.",
        "\u201cI mind the time,\u201d said the first speaker, \u201cwhen she would have done the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.\u201d \u201cAy, that she would,\u201d rejoined the other; \u201cshe had a merry heart.",
        "A many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork.",
        "My old eyes have seen them\u2014ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.\u201d Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought out an old time discoloured tin snuff box, from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into her own.",
        "While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait? \u201cNot long, mistress,\u201d replied the second woman, looking up into her face.",
        "\u201cWe have none of us long to wait for Death.",
        "Patience, patience! He\u2019ll be here soon enough for us all.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, you doting idiot!\u201d said the matron sternly.",
        "\u201cYou, Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?\u201d \u201cOften,\u201d answered the first woman.",
        "\u201cBut will never be again,\u201d added the second one; \u201cthat is, she\u2019ll never wake again but once\u2014and mind, mistress, that won\u2019t be for long!\u201d \u201cLong or short,\u201d said the matron, snappishly, \u201cshe won\u2019t find me here when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing.",
        "It\u2019s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I won\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s more.",
        "Mind that, you impudent old harridans.",
        "If you make a fool of me again, I\u2019ll soon cure you, I warrant you!\u201d She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned towards the bed, caused her to look round.",
        "The patient had raised herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d she cried, in a hollow voice.",
        "\u201cHush, hush!\u201d said one of the women, stooping over her.",
        "\u201cLie down, lie down!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never lie down again alive!\u201d said the woman, struggling.",
        "\u201cI _will_ tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.\u201d She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.",
        "\u201cTurn them away,\u201d said the woman, drowsily; \u201cmake haste! make haste!\u201d The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned to the bedside.",
        "On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of gin and water which had been privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves.",
        "\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy.",
        "\u201cIn this very room\u2014in this very bed\u2014I once nursed a pretty young creetur\u2019, that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all soiled with dust and blood.",
        "She gave birth to a boy, and died.",
        "Let me think\u2014what was the year again!\u201d \u201cNever mind the year,\u201d said the impatient auditor; \u201cwhat about her?\u201d \u201cAy,\u201d murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state, \u201cwhat about her?\u2014what about\u2014I know!\u201d she cried, jumping fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head\u2014\u201cI robbed her, so I did! She wasn\u2019t cold\u2014I tell you she wasn\u2019t cold, when I stole it!\u201d \u201cStole what, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d cried the matron, with a gesture as if she would call for help.",
        "\u201c_It_!\u201d replied the woman, laying her hand over the other\u2019s mouth.",
        "\u201cThe only thing she had.",
        "She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom.",
        "It was gold, I tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!\u201d \u201cGold!\u201d echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back.",
        "\u201cGo on, go on\u2014yes\u2014what of it? Who was the mother? When was it?\u201d \u201cShe charged me to keep it safe,\u201d replied the woman with a groan, \u201cand trusted me as the only woman about her.",
        "I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child\u2019s death, perhaps, is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they had known it all!\u201d \u201cKnown what?\u201d asked the other.",
        "\u201cSpeak!\u201d \u201cThe boy grew so like his mother,\u201d said the woman, rambling on, and not heeding the question, \u201cthat I could never forget it when I saw his face.",
        "Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb! Wait; there\u2019s more to tell.",
        "I have not told you all, have I?\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as they came more faintly from the dying woman.",
        "\u201cBe quick, or it may be too late!\u201d \u201cThe mother,\u201d said the woman, making a more violent effort than before; \u201cthe mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named.",
        "\u2018And oh, kind Heaven!\u2019 she said, folding her thin hands together, \u2018whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!\u2019\u201d \u201cThe boy\u2019s name?\u201d demanded the matron.",
        "\u201cThey _called_ him Oliver,\u201d replied the woman, feebly.",
        "\u201cThe gold I stole was\u2014\u201d \u201cYes, yes\u2014what?\u201d cried the other.",
        "She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.",
        "\u201cStone dead!\u201d said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door was opened.",
        "\u201cAnd nothing to tell, after all,\u201d rejoined the matron, walking carelessly away.",
        "The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering about the body.",

        "Fagin sat in the old den\u2014the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl\u2014brooding over a dull, smoky fire.",
        "He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.",
        "At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr.",
        "Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against Master Bates and Mr.",
        "Chitling.",
        "The countenance of the first named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal of Mr.",
        "Chitling\u2019s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbour\u2019s cards.",
        "It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom within doors.",
        "He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin and water for the accommodation of the company.",
        "Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the gin and water, and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber.",
        "Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be \u201cblowed,\u201d or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr.",
        "Chitling.",
        "It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s two doubles and the rub,\u201d said Mr.",

        "Even when we\u2019ve good cards, Charley and I can\u2019t make nothing of \u2019em.\u201d Either the matter or the manner of this remark, which was made very ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what was the matter.",
        "\u201cMatter, Fagin!\u201d cried Charley.",
        "\u201cI wish you had watched the play.",
        "Tommy Chitling hasn\u2019t won a point; and I went partners with him against the Artful and dumb.\u201d \u201cAy, ay!\u201d said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason.",
        "\u201cTry \u2019em again, Tom; try \u2019em again.\u201d \u201cNo more of it for me, thank \u2019ee, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr.",

        "Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture card, at a shilling at a time.",
        "Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a ground plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar shrillness.",
        "\u201cHow precious dull you are, Tommy!\u201d said the Dodger, stopping short when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr.",

        "\u201cAbout his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the country that he\u2019s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?\u201d \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse as Mr.",
        "Chitling was about to reply.",
        "\u201cWhat do _you_ say, Charley?\u201d \u201c_I_ should say,\u201d replied Master Bates, with a grin, \u201cthat he was uncommon sweet upon Betsy.",

        "Chitling being the victim of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began another laugh.",
        "\u201cNever mind him, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, winking at Mr.",
        "Dawkins, and giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.",
        "\u201cBetsy\u2019s a fine girl.",
        "Stick up to her, Tom.",
        "Stick up to her.\u201d \u201cWhat I mean to say, Fagin,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Chitling, very red in the face, \u201cis, that that isn\u2019t anything to anybody here.\u201d \u201cNo more it is,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cCharley will talk.",
        "Don\u2019t mind him, my dear; don\u2019t mind him.",
        "Betsy\u2019s a fine girl.",
        "Do as she bids you, Tom, and you will make your fortune.\u201d \u201cSo I _do_ do as she bids me,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Chitling; \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been milled, if it hadn\u2019t been for her advice.",
        "But it turned out a good job for you; didn\u2019t it, Fagin! And what\u2019s six weeks of it? It must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don\u2019t want to go out a walking so much; eh, Fagin?\u201d \u201cAh, to be sure, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind it again, Tom, would you,\u201d asked the Dodger, winking upon Charley and the Jew, \u201cif Bet was all right?\u201d \u201cI mean to say that I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d replied Tom, angrily.",
        "\u201cThere, now.",
        "Ah! Who\u2019ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?\u201d \u201cNobody, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cnot a soul, Tom.",
        "I don\u2019t know one of \u2019em that would do it besides you; not one of \u2019em, my dear.\u201d \u201cI might have got clear off, if I\u2019d split upon her; mightn\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d angrily pursued the poor half witted dupe.",
        "\u201cA word from me would have done it; wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d \u201cTo be sure it would, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cBut I didn\u2019t blab it; did I, Fagin?\u201d demanded Tom, pouring question upon question with great volubility.",
        "\u201cNo, no, to be sure,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201cyou were too stout hearted for that.",
        "A deal too stout, my dear!\u201d \u201cPerhaps I was,\u201d rejoined Tom, looking round; \u201cand if I was, what\u2019s to laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?\u201d The Jew, perceiving that Mr.",
        "Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.",
        "But, unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar, that the abused Mr.",
        "Chitling, without any preliminary ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath, while Mr.",
        "Chitling looked on in intense dismay.",
        "\u201cHark!\u201d cried the Dodger at this moment, \u201cI heard the tinkler.\u201d Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.",
        "The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in darkness.",
        "After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin mysteriously.",
        "\u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, \u201calone?\u201d The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that he had better not be funny just then.",
        "Having performed this friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew\u2019s face, and awaited his directions.",
        "The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and feared to know the worst.",
        "At length he raised his head.",
        "\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he asked.",
        "The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave the room.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; \u201cbring him down.",
        "Hush! Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!\u201d This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was softly and immediately obeyed.",
        "There was no sound of their whereabout, when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and followed by a man in a coarse smock frock; who, after casting a hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.",
        "\u201cHow are you, Faguey?\u201d said this worthy, nodding to the Jew.",
        "\u201cPop that shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when I cut; that\u2019s the time of day! You\u2019ll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now.\u201d With these words he pulled up the smock frock; and, winding it round his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.",
        "\u201cSee there, Faguey,\u201d he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots; \u201cnot a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of blacking, by Jove! But don\u2019t look at me in that way, man.",
        "All in good time.",
        "I can\u2019t talk about business till I\u2019ve eat and drank; so produce the sustainance, and let\u2019s have a quiet fill out for the first time these three days!\u201d The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure.",
        "To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation.",
        "At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.",
        "He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self satisfied smirk of flash Toby Crackit.",
        "Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.",
        "It was all of no use.",
        "Toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.",
        "\u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said Toby.",
        "\u201cYes, yes!\u201d interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.",
        "Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he quietly resumed.",
        "\u201cFirst and foremost, Faguey,\u201d said the housebreaker, \u201chow\u2019s Bill?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.",
        "\u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say\u2014\u201d began Toby, turning pale.",
        "\u201cMean!\u201d cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground.",
        "\u201cWhere are they? Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they hiding? Why have they not been here?\u201d \u201cThe crack failed,\u201d said Toby faintly.",
        "\u201cI know it,\u201d replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it.",
        "\u201cWhat more?\u201d \u201cThey fired and hit the boy.",
        "We cut over the fields at the back, with him between us\u2014straight as the crow flies\u2014through hedge and ditch.",
        "They gave chase.",
        "Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon us.\u201d \u201cThe boy!\u201d \u201cBill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind.",
        "We stopped to take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold.",
        "They were close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch.",
        "Alive or dead, that\u2019s all I know about him.\u201d The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.",
        "CHAPTER XXVI.",
        "IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the effect of Toby Crackit\u2019s intelligence.",
        "He had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him back upon the pavement.",
        "Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main streets, and skulking only through the by ways and alleys, he at length emerged on Snow Hill.",
        "Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.",
        "Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading to Saffron Hill.",
        "In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of second hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick pockets.",
        "Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the door posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them.",
        "Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its coffee shop, its beer shop, and its fried fish warehouse.",
        "It is a commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at early morning, and setting in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in dark back parlours, and who go as strangely as they come.",
        "Here, the clothesman, the shoe vamper, and the rag merchant, display their goods, as sign boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen stuff and linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.",
        "It was into this place that the Jew turned.",
        "He was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look out to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along.",
        "He replied to their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child\u2019s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door.",
        "\u201cWhy, the sight of you, Mr.",
        "Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!\u201d said this respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew\u2019s inquiry after his health.",
        "\u201cThe neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,\u201d said Fagin, elevating his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.",
        "\u201cWell, I\u2019ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,\u201d replied the trader; \u201cbut it soon cools down again; don\u2019t you find it so?\u201d Fagin nodded in the affirmative.",
        "Pointing in the direction of Saffron Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight.",
        "\u201cAt the Cripples?\u201d inquired the man.",
        "The Jew nodded.",
        "\u201cLet me see,\u201d pursued the merchant, reflecting.",
        "\u201cYes, there\u2019s some half dozen of \u2019em gone in, that I knows.",
        "I don\u2019t think your friend\u2019s there.\u201d \u201cSikes is not, I suppose?\u201d inquired the Jew, with a disappointed countenance.",
        "\u201c_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,\u201d replied the little man, shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly.",
        "\u201cHave you got anything in my line tonight?\u201d \u201cNothing tonight,\u201d said the Jew, turning away.",
        "\u201cAre you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?\u201d cried the little man, calling after him.",
        "\u201cStop! I don\u2019t mind if I have a drop there with you!\u201d But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr.",
        "Lively\u2019s presence.",
        "By the time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr.",
        "Lively, after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.",
        "The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the public house in which Mr.",
        "Sikes and his dog have already figured.",
        "Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in search of some particular person.",
        "The room was illuminated by two gas lights; the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters, and closely drawn curtains of faded red, from being visible outside.",
        "The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more.",
        "By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner.",
        "As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could.",
        "When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman\u2019s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause.",
        "It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group.",
        "There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an ear for everything that was said\u2014and sharp ones, too.",
        "Near him were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness.",
        "Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked: others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.",
        "Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search.",
        "Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.",
        "\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr.",
        "Fagin?\u201d inquired the man, as he followed him out to the landing.",
        "\u201cWon\u2019t you join us? They\u2019ll be delighted, every one of \u2019em.\u201d The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, \u201cIs _he_ here?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the man.",
        "\u201cAnd no news of Barney?\u201d inquired Fagin.",
        "\u201cNone,\u201d replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he.",
        "\u201cHe won\u2019t stir till it\u2019s all safe.",
        "Depend on it, they\u2019re on the scent down there; and that if he moved, he\u2019d blow upon the thing at once.",
        "He\u2019s all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him.",
        "I\u2019ll pound it, that Barney\u2019s managing properly.",
        "Let him alone for that.\u201d \u201cWill _he_ be here tonight?\u201d asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before.",
        "\u201cMonks, do you mean?\u201d inquired the landlord, hesitating.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCertain,\u201d replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; \u201cI expected him here before now.",
        "If you\u2019ll wait ten minutes, he\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his absence.",
        "\u201cTell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me tonight.",
        "No, say tomorrow.",
        "As he is not here, tomorrow will be time enough.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the man.",
        "\u201cNothing more?\u201d \u201cNot a word now,\u201d said the Jew, descending the stairs.",
        "\u201cI say,\u201d said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse whisper; \u201cwhat a time this would be for a sell! I\u2019ve got Phil Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!\u201d \u201cAh! But it\u2019s not Phil Barker\u2019s time,\u201d said the Jew, looking up.",
        "\u201cPhil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives\u2014_while they last_.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d The landlord reciprocated the old man\u2019s laugh; and returned to his guests.",
        "The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought.",
        "After a brief reflection, he called a hack cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.",
        "He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr.",
        "Sikes\u2019s residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, \u201cif there is any deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.\u201d She was in her room, the woman said.",
        "Fagin crept softly upstairs, and entered it without any previous ceremony.",
        "The girl was alone; lying with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.",
        "\u201cShe has been drinking,\u201d thought the Jew, cooly, \u201cor perhaps she is only miserable.\u201d The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.",
        "She eyed his crafty face narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit\u2019s story.",
        "When it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word.",
        "She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all.",
        "During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly returned.",
        "Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone.",
        "At length he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most conciliatory tone, \u201cAnd where should you think Bill was now, my dear?\u201d The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying.",
        "\u201cAnd the boy, too,\u201d said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face.",
        "\u201cPoor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!\u201d \u201cThe child,\u201d said the girl, suddenly looking up, \u201cis better where he is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, in amazement.",
        "\u201cAy, I do,\u201d returned the girl, meeting his gaze.",
        "\u201cI shall be glad to have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.",
        "I can\u2019t bear to have him about me.",
        "The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of you.\u201d \u201cPooh!\u201d said the Jew, scornfully.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d \u201cAm I?\u201d cried the girl bitterly.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no fault of yours, if I am not! You\u2019d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;\u2014the humour doesn\u2019t suit you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d rejoined the Jew, furiously.",
        "\u201cIt does not.\u201d \u201cChange it, then!\u201d responded the girl, with a laugh.",
        "\u201cChange it!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his companion\u2019s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, \u201cI _will_ change it! Listen to me, you drab.",
        "Listen to me, who with six words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull\u2019s throat between my fingers now.",
        "If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch.",
        "And do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too late!\u201d \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d cried the girl involuntarily.",
        "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d pursued Fagin, mad with rage.",
        "\u201cWhen the boy\u2019s worth hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and has the power to, to\u2014\u201d Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour.",
        "A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy.",
        "After a short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion.",
        "He appeared somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her.",
        "\u201cNancy, dear!\u201d croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.",
        "\u201cDid you mind me, dear?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry me now, Fagin!\u201d replied the girl, raising her head languidly.",
        "\u201cIf Bill has not done it this time, he will another.",
        "He has done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can\u2019t he won\u2019t; so no more about that.\u201d \u201cRegarding this boy, my dear?\u201d said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together.",
        "\u201cThe boy must take his chance with the rest,\u201d interrupted Nancy, hastily; \u201cand I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm\u2019s way, and out of yours,\u2014that is, if Bill comes to no harm.",
        "And if Toby got clear off, Bill\u2019s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill\u2019s worth two of Toby any time.\u201d \u201cAnd about what I was saying, my dear?\u201d observed the Jew, keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her.",
        "\u201cYou must say it all over again, if it\u2019s anything you want me to do,\u201d rejoined Nancy; \u201cand if it is, you had better wait till tomorrow.",
        "You put me up for a minute; but now I\u2019m stupid again.\u201d Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed.",
        "Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the Jew\u2019s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than checked.",
        "Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the Jew\u2019s supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of \u201cNever say die!\u201d and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr.",
        "Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.",
        "Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard, and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr.",
        "Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table.",
        "It was within an hour of midnight.",
        "The weather being dark, and piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter.",
        "The sharp wind that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening fast home.",
        "It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.",
        "He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in his pocket for the door key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.",
        "\u201cFagin!\u201d whispered a voice close to his ear.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said the Jew, turning quickly round, \u201cis that\u2014\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d interrupted the stranger.",
        "\u201cI have been lingering here these two hours.",
        "Where the devil have you been?\u201d \u201cOn your business, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke.",
        "\u201cOn your business all night.\u201d \u201cOh, of course!\u201d said the stranger, with a sneer.",
        "\u201cWell; and what\u2019s come of it?\u201d \u201cNothing good,\u201d said the Jew.",
        "\u201cNothing bad, I hope?\u201d said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a startled look on his companion.",
        "The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger, interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say, under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and the wind blew through him.",
        "Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it softly, while he got a light.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s as dark as the grave,\u201d said the man, groping forward a few steps.",
        "\u201cMake haste!\u201d \u201cShut the door,\u201d whispered Fagin from the end of the passage.",
        "As he spoke, it closed with a loud noise.",
        "\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my doing,\u201d said the other man, feeling his way.",
        "\u201cThe wind blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other.",
        "Look sharp with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole.\u201d Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.",
        "After a short absence, he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one.",
        "Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs.",
        "\u201cWe can say the few words we\u2019ve got to say in here, my dear,\u201d said the Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; \u201cand as there are holes in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we\u2019ll set the candle on the stairs.",
        "There!\u201d With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.",
        "This done, he led the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken arm chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind the door.",
        "Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm chair opposite, they sat face to face.",
        "It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall.",
        "They conversed for some time in whispers.",
        "Though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.",
        "They might have been talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks\u2014by which name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquy\u2014said, raising his voice a little, \u201cI tell you again, it was badly planned.",
        "Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?\u201d \u201cOnly hear him!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.",
        "\u201cWhy, do you mean to say you couldn\u2019t have done it, if you had chosen?\u201d demanded Monks, sternly.",
        "\u201cHaven\u2019t you done it, with other boys, scores of times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn\u2019t you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for life?\u201d \u201cWhose turn would that have served, my dear?\u201d inquired the Jew humbly.",
        "\u201cMine,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cBut not mine,\u201d said the Jew, submissively.",
        "\u201cHe might have become of use to me.",
        "When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?\u201d \u201cWhat then?\u201d demanded Monks.",
        "\u201cI saw it was not easy to train him to the business,\u201d replied the Jew; \u201che was not like other boys in the same circumstances.\u201d \u201cCurse him, no!\u201d muttered the man, \u201cor he would have been a thief, long ago.\u201d \u201cI had no hold upon him to make him worse,\u201d pursued the Jew, anxiously watching the countenance of his companion.",
        "\u201cHis hand was not in.",
        "I had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning, or we labour in vain.",
        "What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger and Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.\u201d \u201c_That_ was not my doing,\u201d observed Monks.",
        "\u201cNo, no, my dear!\u201d renewed the Jew.",
        "\u201cAnd I don\u2019t quarrel with it now; because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for.",
        "Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl; and then _she_ begins to favour him.\u201d \u201cThrottle the girl!\u201d said Monks, impatiently.",
        "\u201cWhy, we can\u2019t afford to do that just now, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, smiling; \u201cand, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of these days, I might be glad to have it done.",
        "I know what these girls are, Monks, well.",
        "As soon as the boy begins to harden, she\u2019ll care no more for him, than for a block of wood.",
        "You want him made a thief.",
        "If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and, if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,\u2014\u201cit\u2019s not likely, mind,\u2014but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no fault of mine if he is!\u201d interposed the other man, with a look of terror, and clasping the Jew\u2019s arm with trembling hands.",
        "\u201cMind that.",
        "Fagin! I had no hand in it.",
        "Anything but his death, I told you from the first.",
        "I won\u2019t shed blood; it\u2019s always found out, and haunts a man besides.",
        "If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? Fire this infernal den! What\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms, as he sprung to his feet.",
        "\u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cYonder!\u201d replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.",
        "\u201cThe shadow! I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like a breath!\u201d The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.",
        "The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed.",
        "It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces.",
        "They listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s your fancy,\u201d said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his companion.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw it!\u201d replied Monks, trembling.",
        "\u201cIt was bending forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.\u201d The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and, telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs.",
        "They looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty.",
        "They descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below.",
        "The green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.",
        "\u201cWhat do you think now?\u201d said the Jew, when they had regained the passage.",
        "\u201cBesides ourselves, there\u2019s not a creature in the house except Toby and the boys; and they\u2019re safe enough.",
        "See here!\u201d As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.",
        "This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr.",
        "Monks.",
        "His protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination.",
        "He declined any renewal of the conversation, however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one o\u2019clock.",
        "And so the amiable couple parted.",
        "CHAPTER XXVII.",
        "ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words\u2014trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated\u2014hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands.",
        "Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies\u2019 beadles, or court of law beadles, or even chapel of ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.",
        "Bumble had re counted the teaspoons, re weighed the sugar tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs.",
        "Corney to return.",
        "Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs.",
        "Corney\u2019s approach, it occured to Mr.",
        "Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs.",
        "Corney\u2019s chest of drawers.",
        "Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr.",
        "Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.",
        "Arriving, in course of time, at the right hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr.",
        "Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.",
        "He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs.",
        "Corney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.",
        "\u201cMrs.",
        "Corney,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, stooping over the matron, \u201cwhat is this, ma\u2019am? Has anything happened, ma\u2019am? Pray answer me: I\u2019m on\u2014on\u2014\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word \u201ctenterhooks,\u201d so he said \u201cbroken bottles.\u201d \u201cOh, Mr.",
        "Bumble!\u201d cried the lady, \u201cI have been so dreadfully put out!\u201d \u201cPut out, ma\u2019am!\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Bumble; \u201cwho has dared to\u2014? I know!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, \u201cthis is them wicious paupers!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dreadful to think of!\u201d said the lady, shuddering.",
        "\u201cThen _don\u2019t_ think of it, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d whimpered the lady.",
        "\u201cThen take something, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble soothingly.",
        "\u201cA little of the wine?\u201d \u201cNot for the world!\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Corney.",
        "\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u2014oh! The top shelf in the right hand corner\u2014oh!\u201d Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms.",
        "Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea cup with its contents, and held it to the lady\u2019s lips.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m better now,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Corney, falling back, after drinking half of it.",
        "Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.",
        "\u201cPeppermint,\u201d exclaimed Mrs.",
        "Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke.",
        "\u201cTry it! There\u2019s a little\u2014a little something else in it.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s very comforting,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Corney.",
        "\u201cVery much so indeed, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the beadle.",
        "As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her.",
        "\u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Corney.",
        "\u201cI am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.\u201d \u201cNot weak, ma\u2019am,\u201d retorted Mr.",
        "Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer.",
        "\u201cAre you a weak creetur, Mrs.",
        "Corney?\u201d \u201cWe are all weak creeturs,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Corney, laying down a general principle.",
        "\u201cSo we are,\u201d said the beadle.",
        "Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards.",
        "By the expiration of that time, Mr.",
        "Bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of Mrs.",
        "Corney\u2019s chair, where it had previously rested, to Mrs.",
        "Corney\u2019s apron string, round which it gradually became entwined.",

        "\u201cAnother room, and this, ma\u2019am, would be a complete thing.\u201d \u201cIt would be too much for one,\u201d murmured the lady.",

        "Corney\u2019s face.",
        "Corney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.",

        "\u201cYou know that Mr.",
        "Slout is worse tonight, my fascinator?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Mrs.",

        "When is it to come off?\u201d Mrs.",
        "Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed.",
        "At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was \u201ca irresistible duck.\u201d Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady\u2019s spirits.",
        "While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.",
        "Bumble with the old woman\u2019s decease.",
        "\u201cVery good,\u201d said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; \u201cI\u2019ll call at Sowerberry\u2019s as I go home, and tell him to send tomorrow morning.",
        "Was it that as frightened you, love?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything particular, dear,\u201d said the lady evasively.",
        "\u201cIt must have been something, love,\u201d urged Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWon\u2019t you tell your own B.?\u201d \u201cNot now,\u201d rejoined the lady; \u201cone of these days.",
        "After we\u2019re married, dear.\u201d \u201cAfter we\u2019re married!\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t any impudence from any of them male paupers as\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, love!\u201d interposed the lady, hastily.",
        "\u201cIf I thought it was,\u201d continued Mr.",
        "Bumble; \u201cif I thought as any one of \u2019em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have dared to do it, love,\u201d responded the lady.",
        "\u201cThey had better not!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, clenching his fist.",
        "\u201cLet me see any man, porochial or extra porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he wouldn\u2019t do it a second time!\u201d Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady\u2019s charms; but, as Mr.",
        "Bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove.",
        "The dove then turned up his coat collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers\u2019 ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse master with needful acerbity.",
        "Assured of his qualifications, Mr.",
        "Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.",
        "Now, Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting up.",
        "Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised.",
        "The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter pot and a wine bottle.",
        "At the upper end of the table, Mr.",
        "Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.",
        "Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr.",
        "Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity.",
        "A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman\u2019s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted.",
        "\u201cHere\u2019s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!\u201d said Charlotte; \u201ctry him, do; only this one.\u201d \u201cWhat a delicious thing is a oyster!\u201d remarked Mr.",
        "Claypole, after he had swallowed it.",
        "\u201cWhat a pity it is, a number of \u2019em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn\u2019t it, Charlotte?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite a cruelty,\u201d said Charlotte.",
        "\u201cSo it is,\u201d acquiesced Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cAn\u2019t yer fond of oysters?\u201d \u201cNot overmuch,\u201d replied Charlotte.",
        "\u201cI like to see you eat \u2019em, Noah dear, better than eating \u2019em myself.\u201d \u201cLor!\u201d said Noah, reflectively; \u201chow queer!\u201d \u201cHave another,\u201d said Charlotte.",
        "\u201cHere\u2019s one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t manage any more,\u201d said Noah.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m very sorry.",
        "Come here, Charlotte, and I\u2019ll kiss yer.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, bursting into the room.",
        "\u201cSay that again, sir.\u201d Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron.",
        "Claypole, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror.",
        "\u201cSay it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cHow dare you mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx? Kiss her!\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Bumble, in strong indignation.",
        "\u201cFaugh!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it!\u201d said Noah, blubbering.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s always a kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.\u201d \u201cOh, Noah,\u201d cried Charlotte, reproachfully.",
        "\u201cYer are; yer know yer are!\u201d retorted Noah.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s always a doin\u2019 of it, Mr.",
        "Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Bumble, sternly.",
        "\u201cTake yourself downstairs, ma\u2019am.",
        "Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr.",
        "Bumble said he was to send a old woman\u2019s shell after breakfast tomorrow morning.",
        "Do you hear sir? Kissing!\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Bumble, holding up his hands.",
        "\u201cThe sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don\u2019t take their abominable courses under consideration, this country\u2019s ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!\u201d With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker\u2019s premises.",
        "And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman\u2019s funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.",
        "CHAPTER XXVIII.",
        "LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES \u201cWolves tear your throats!\u201d muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth.",
        "\u201cI wish I was among some of you; you\u2019d howl the hoarser for it.\u201d As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers.",
        "There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction.",
        "\u201cStop, you white livered hound!\u201d cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.",
        "\u201cStop!\u201d The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand still.",
        "For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol shot; and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.",
        "\u201cBear a hand with the boy,\u201d cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate.",
        "\u201cCome back!\u201d Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along.",
        "\u201cQuicker!\u201d cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t play booty with me.\u201d At this moment the noise grew louder.",
        "Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all up, Bill!\u201d cried Toby; \u201cdrop the kid, and show \u2019em your heels.\u201d With this parting advice, Mr.",
        "Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed.",
        "Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.",
        "\u201cHo, ho, there!\u201d cried a tremulous voice in the rear.",
        "\u201cPincher! Neptune! Come here, come here!\u201d The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command.",
        "Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.",
        "\u201cMy advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,\u201d said the fattest man of the party, \u201cthat we \u2019mediately go home again.\u201d \u201cI am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr.",
        "Giles,\u201d said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.",
        "\u201cI shouldn\u2019t wish to appear ill mannered, gentlemen,\u201d said the third, who had called the dogs back, \u201cMr.",
        "Giles ought to know.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d replied the shorter man; \u201cand whatever Mr.",
        "Giles says, it isn\u2019t our place to contradict him.",
        "No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.\u201d To tell the truth, the little man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke.",
        "\u201cYou are afraid, Brittles,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "\u201cI an\u2019t,\u201d said Brittles.",
        "\u201cYou are,\u201d said Giles.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a falsehood, Mr.",
        "Giles,\u201d said Brittles.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a lie, Brittles,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "Now, these four retorts arose from Mr.",
        "Giles\u2019s taunt; and Mr.",
        "Giles\u2019s taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment.",
        "The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cwe\u2019re all afraid.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, who was the palest of the party.",
        "\u201cSo I do,\u201d replied the man.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances.",
        "I am.\u201d \u201cSo am I,\u201d said Brittles; \u201conly there\u2019s no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.\u201d These frank admissions softened Mr.",
        "Giles, who at once owned that _he_ was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until Mr.",
        "Giles (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.",
        "\u201cBut it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, when he had explained, \u201cwhat a man will do, when his blood is up.",
        "I should have committed murder\u2014I know I should\u2014if we\u2019d caught one of them rascals.\u201d As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.",
        "\u201cI know what it was,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles; \u201cit was the gate.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t wonder if it was,\u201d exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea.",
        "\u201cYou may depend upon it,\u201d said Giles, \u201cthat that gate stopped the flow of the excitement.",
        "I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.\u201d By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.",
        "It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.",
        "This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit.",
        "Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.",
        "Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.",
        "Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne.",
        "The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.",
        "The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.",
        "Still, Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him.",
        "Morning drew on apace.",
        "The air became more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue\u2014the death of night, rather than the birth of day\u2014glimmered faintly in the sky.",
        "The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes.",
        "The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.",
        "But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay.",
        "At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke.",
        "His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood.",
        "He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain.",
        "Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.",
        "After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and essayed to walk.",
        "His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man.",
        "But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.",
        "And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind.",
        "He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing\u2014for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them.",
        "Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber\u2019s grasp upon his wrist.",
        "Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away.",
        "Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.",
        "Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road.",
        "Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.",
        "He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach.",
        "Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.",
        "He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.",
        "As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before.",
        "He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.",
        "That garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men\u2019s mercy.",
        "It was the very house they had attempted to rob.",
        "Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight.",
        "Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly? He pushed against the garden gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.",
        "He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.",
        "It happened that about this time, Mr.",
        "Giles, Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.",
        "Not that it was Mr.",
        "Giles\u2019s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society.",
        "But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr.",
        "Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his hearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.",
        "\u201cIt was about half past two,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, \u201cor I wouldn\u2019t swear that it mightn\u2019t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr.",
        "Giles turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table cloth over him to imitate bed clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.\u201d At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear.",
        "\u201c\u2014Heerd a noise,\u201d continued Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "\u201cI says, at first, \u2018This is illusion\u2019; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of a noise?\u201d asked the cook.",
        "\u201cA kind of a busting noise,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Giles, looking round him.",
        "\u201cMore like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg grater,\u201d suggested Brittles.",
        "\u201cIt was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Giles; \u201cbut, at this time, it had a busting sound.",
        "I turned down the clothes\u201d; continued Giles, rolling back the table cloth, \u201csat up in bed; and listened.\u201d The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated \u201cLor!\u201d and drew their chairs closer together.",
        "\u201cI heerd it now, quite apparent,\u201d resumed Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "\u201c\u2018Somebody,\u2019 I says, \u2018is forcing of a door, or window; what\u2019s to be done? I\u2019ll call up that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,\u2019 I says, \u2018may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.\u2019\u201d Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror.",
        "\u201cI tossed off the clothes,\u201d said Giles, throwing away the table cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, \u201cgot softly out of bed; drew on a pair of\u2014\u201d \u201cLadies present, Mr.",
        "Giles,\u201d murmured the tinker.",
        "\u201c\u2014Of _shoes_, sir,\u201d said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word; \u201cseized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.",
        "\u2018Brittles,\u2019 I says, when I had woke him, \u2018don\u2019t be frightened!\u2019\u201d \u201cSo you did,\u201d observed Brittles, in a low voice.",
        "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re dead men, I think, Brittles,\u2019 I says,\u201d continued Giles; \u201c\u2018but don\u2019t be frightened.\u2019\u201d \u201c_Was_ he frightened?\u201d asked the cook.",
        "\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "\u201cHe was as firm\u2014ah! pretty near as firm as I was.\u201d \u201cI should have died at once, I\u2019m sure, if it had been me,\u201d observed the housemaid.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a woman,\u201d retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.",
        "\u201cBrittles is right,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; \u201cfrom a woman, nothing else was to be expected.",
        "We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on Brittle\u2019s hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark,\u2014as it might be so.\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair.",
        "The cook and housemaid screamed.",
        "\u201cIt was a knock,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, assuming perfect serenity.",
        "\u201cOpen the door, somebody.\u201d Nobody moved.",
        "\u201cIt seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself; \u201cbut the door must be opened.",
        "Do you hear, somebody?\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply.",
        "Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep.",
        "The women were out of the question.",
        "\u201cIf Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, after a short silence, \u201cI am ready to make one.\u201d \u201cSo am I,\u201d said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep.",
        "Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.",
        "The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear.",
        "By the advice of Mr.",
        "Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs\u2019 tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely.",
        "These precautions having been taken, Mr.",
        "Giles held on fast by the tinker\u2019s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door.",
        "Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other\u2019s shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.",
        "\u201cA boy!\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the\u2014eh?\u2014Why\u2014Brittles\u2014look here\u2014don\u2019t you know?\u201d Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry.",
        "Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.",
        "\u201cHere he is!\u201d bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase; \u201chere\u2019s one of the thieves, ma\u2019am! Here\u2019s a thief, miss! Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.\u201d \u201c\u2014In a lantern, miss,\u201d cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.",
        "The two women servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.",
        "Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged.",
        "In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.",
        "\u201cGiles!\u201d whispered the voice from the stair head.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m here, miss,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened, miss; I ain\u2019t much injured.",
        "He didn\u2019t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I was soon too many for him.\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d replied the young lady; \u201cyou frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did.",
        "Is the poor creature much hurt?\u201d \u201cWounded desperate, miss,\u201d replied Giles, with indescribable complacency.",
        "\u201cHe looks as if he was a going, miss,\u201d bawled Brittles, in the same manner as before.",
        "\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?\u201d \u201cHush, pray; there\u2019s a good man!\u201d rejoined the lady.",
        "\u201cWait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.\u201d With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away.",
        "She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr.",
        "Giles\u2019s room; and that Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.",
        "\u201cBut won\u2019t you take one look at him, first, miss?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Giles, with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down.",
        "\u201cNot one little peep, miss?\u201d \u201cNot now, for the world,\u201d replied the young lady.",
        "\u201cPoor fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!\u201d The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child.",
        "Then, bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.",
        "CHAPTER XXIX.",
        "HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of old fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a well spread breakfast table.",
        "Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them.",
        "He had taken his station some half way between the side board and the breakfast table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.",
        "Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she.",
        "Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her.",
        "Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.",
        "The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for God\u2019s good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers.",
        "She was not past seventeen.",
        "Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions.",
        "The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness.",
        "She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table.",
        "Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.",
        "\u201cAnd Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\u201d asked the old lady, after a pause.",
        "\u201cAn hour and twelve minutes, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.",
        "\u201cHe is always slow,\u201d remarked the old lady.",
        "\u201cBrittles always was a slow boy, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied the attendant.",
        "And seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one.",
        "\u201cHe gets worse instead of better, I think,\u201d said the elder lady.",
        "\u201cIt is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,\u201d said the young lady, smiling.",
        "Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr.",
        "Giles and the breakfast table together.",
        "\u201cI never heard of such a thing!\u201d exclaimed the fat gentleman.",
        "\u201cMy dear Mrs.",
        "Maylie\u2014bless my soul\u2014in the silence of the night, too\u2014I _never_ heard of such a thing!\u201d With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves.",
        "\u201cYou ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\u201d said the fat gentleman.",
        "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I\u2019m sure, under such circumstances.",
        "Dear, dear! So unexpected! In the silence of the night, too!\u201d The doctor seemed especially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous.",
        "\u201cAnd you, Miss Rose,\u201d said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \u201cI\u2014\u201d \u201cOh! very much so, indeed,\u201d said Rose, interrupting him; \u201cbut there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\u201d \u201cAh! to be sure,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cso there is.",
        "That was your handiwork, Giles, I understand.\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.",
        "\u201cHonour, eh?\u201d said the doctor; \u201cwell, I don\u2019t know; perhaps it\u2019s as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces.",
        "Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\u2019ve fought a duel, Giles.\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party.",
        "\u201cGad, that\u2019s true!\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cWhere is he? Show me the way.",
        "I\u2019ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "That\u2019s the little window that he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn\u2019t have believed it!\u201d Talking all the way, he followed Mr.",
        "Giles upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr.",
        "Losberne, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as \u201cthe doctor,\u201d had grown fat, more from good humour than from good living: and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.",
        "The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated.",
        "A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above.",
        "At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.",
        "\u201cThis is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs.",
        "Maylie,\u201d said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.",
        "\u201cHe is not in danger, I hope?\u201d said the old lady.",
        "\u201cWhy, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cthough I don\u2019t think he is.",
        "Have you seen the thief?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the old lady.",
        "\u201cNor heard anything about him?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Mr.",
        "Giles; \u201cbut I was going to tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\u201d The fact was, that Mr.",
        "Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy.",
        "Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.",
        "\u201cRose wished to see the man,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d \u201cHumph!\u201d rejoined the doctor.",
        "\u201cThere is nothing very alarming in his appearance.",
        "Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\u201d \u201cIf it be necessary,\u201d replied the old lady, \u201ccertainly not.\u201d \u201cThen I think it is necessary,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cat all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it.",
        "He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now.",
        "Allow me\u2014Miss Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!\u201d CHAPTER XXX.",
        "RELATES WHAT OLIVER\u2019S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\u2019s arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs.",
        "Maylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom door, \u201clet us hear what you think of him.",
        "He has not been shaved very recently, but he don\u2019t look at all ferocious notwithstanding.",
        "Stop, though! Let me first see that he is in visiting order.\u201d Stepping before them, he looked into the room.",
        "Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed.",
        "Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.",
        "His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow.",
        "The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence.",
        "Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered Oliver\u2019s hair from his face.",
        "As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead.",
        "The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known.",
        "Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.",
        "\u201cWhat can this mean?\u201d exclaimed the elder lady.",
        "\u201cThis poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!\u201d \u201cVice,\u201d said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \u201ctakes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shall not enshrine her?\u201d \u201cBut at so early an age!\u201d urged Rose.",
        "\u201cMy dear young lady,\u201d rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head; \u201ccrime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone.",
        "The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\u201d \u201cBut, can you\u2014oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\u201d said Rose.",
        "The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.",
        "\u201cBut even if he has been wicked,\u201d pursued Rose, \u201cthink how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother\u2019s love, or the comfort of a home; that ill usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.",
        "Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy\u2019s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment.",
        "Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!\u201d \u201cMy dear love,\u201d said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom, \u201cdo you think I would harm a hair of his head?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d replied Rose, eagerly.",
        "\u201cNo, surely,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cmy days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?\u201d \u201cLet me think, ma\u2019am,\u201d said the doctor; \u201clet me think.\u201d Mr.",
        "Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully.",
        "After various exclamations of \u201cI\u2019ve got it now\u201d and \u201cno, I haven\u2019t,\u201d and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows: \u201cI think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles, and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it.",
        "Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides.",
        "You don\u2019t object to that?\u201d \u201cUnless there is some other way of preserving the child,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cThere is no other,\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cNo other, take my word for it.\u201d \u201cThen my aunt invests you with full power,\u201d said Rose, smiling through her tears; \u201cbut pray don\u2019t be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.\u201d \u201cYou seem to think,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cthat everybody is disposed to be hard hearted today, except yourself, Miss Rose.",
        "I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.\u201d \u201cYou are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\u201d returned Rose, blushing.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, laughing heartily, \u201cthat is no very difficult matter.",
        "But to return to this boy.",
        "The great point of our agreement is yet to come.",
        "He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick headed constable fellow downstairs that he musn\u2019t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger.",
        "Now I make this stipulation\u2014that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.\u201d \u201cOh no, aunt!\u201d entreated Rose.",
        "\u201cOh yes, aunt!\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d \u201cHe cannot be hardened in vice,\u201d said Rose; \u201cIt is impossible.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d retorted the doctor; \u201cthen so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.\u201d Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.",
        "The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr.",
        "Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.",
        "It was evening, indeed, before the kind hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.",
        "The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done.",
        "The conference was a long one.",
        "Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength.",
        "It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him.",
        "Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men\u2019s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\u2019s life brings with it! Oliver\u2019s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept.",
        "He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur.",
        "The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.",
        "There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women servants, Mr.",
        "Brittles, Mr.",
        "Giles, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable.",
        "The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale\u2014as indeed he had.",
        "The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr.",
        "Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr.",
        "Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it.",
        "\u201cSit still!\u201d said the doctor, waving his hand.",
        "\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles.",
        "\u201cMisses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \u2019em here.\u201d Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr.",
        "Giles\u2019s condescension.",
        "Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them.",
        "\u201cHow is the patient tonight, sir?\u201d asked Giles.",
        "\u201cSo so\u201d; returned the doctor.",
        "\u201cI am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr.",
        "Giles.\u201d \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mean to say, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, trembling, \u201cthat he\u2019s going to die.",
        "If I thought it, I should never be happy again.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the point,\u201d said the doctor, mysteriously.",
        "Giles, are you a Protestant?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, I hope so,\u201d faltered Mr.",
        "Giles, who had turned very pale.",
        "\u201cAnd what are _you_, boy?\u201d said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles.",
        "\u201cLord bless me, sir!\u201d replied Brittles, starting violently; \u201cI\u2019m the same as Mr.",
        "Giles, sir.\u201d \u201cThen tell me this,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cboth of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We are prepared for you!\u201d The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.",
        "\u201cPay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\u201d said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\u2019s utmost acuteness.",
        "\u201cSomething may come of this before long.\u201d The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney corner.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s what it is, sir,\u201d replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way.",
        "\u201cHere\u2019s the house broken into,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand a couple of men catch one moment\u2019s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.",
        "Here\u2019s a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him\u2014by doing which, they place his life in great danger\u2014and swear he is the thief.",
        "Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?\u201d The constable nodded profoundly.",
        "He said, if that wasn\u2019t law, he would be glad to know what was.",
        "\u201cI ask you again,\u201d thundered the doctor, \u201care you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?\u201d Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr.",
        "Giles; Mr.",
        "Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the runners!\u201d cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.",
        "\u201cThe what?\u201d exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.",
        "\u201cThe Bow Street officers, sir,\u201d replied Brittles, taking up a candle; \u201cme and Mr.",
        "Giles sent for \u2019em this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d cried the doctor.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d replied Brittles; \u201cI sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they weren\u2019t here before, sir.\u201d \u201cYou did, did you? Then confound your\u2014slow coaches down here; that\u2019s all,\u201d said the doctor, walking away.",
        "CHAPTER XXXI.",
        "INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.",
        "\u201cOpen the door,\u201d replied a man outside; \u201cit\u2019s the officers from Bow Street, as was sent to today.\u201d Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.",
        "\u201cJust send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\u201d said the officer; \u201che\u2019s in the gig, a minding the prad.",
        "Have you got a coach \u2019us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\u201d Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration.",
        "This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great coats and hats, and showed like what they were.",
        "The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.",
        "The other was a red headed, bony man, in top boots; with a rather ill favoured countenance, and a turned up sinister looking nose.",
        "\u201cTell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\u201d said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table.",
        "\u201cOh! Good evening, master.",
        "Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?\u201d This was addressed to Mr.",
        "Losberne, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door.",
        "\u201cThis is the lady of the house,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne, motioning towards Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "Blathers made a bow.",
        "Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same.",
        "The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it\u2014one of the two\u2014seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.",
        "\u201cNow, with regard to this here robbery, master,\u201d said Blathers.",
        "\u201cWhat are the circumstances?\u201d Mr.",
        "Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution.",
        "Messrs.",
        "Blathers and Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\u201d said Blathers; \u201cbut my opinion at once is,\u2014I don\u2019t mind committing myself to that extent,\u2014that this wasn\u2019t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied Duff.",
        "\u201cAnd, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne, with a smile.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s it, master,\u201d replied Blathers.",
        "\u201cThis is all about the robbery, is it?\u201d \u201cAll,\u201d replied the doctor.",
        "\u201cNow, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a talking on?\u201d said Blathers.",
        "\u201cNothing at all,\u201d replied the doctor.",
        "\u201cOne of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it\u2019s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\u201d \u201cWery easy disposed of, if it is,\u201d remarked Duff.",
        "\u201cWhat he says is quite correct,\u201d observed Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets.",
        "\u201cWho is the boy? What account does he give of himself? Where did he come from? He didn\u2019t drop out of the clouds, did he, master?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies.",
        "\u201cI know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently.",
        "You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Blathers.",
        "\u201cWe had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards.",
        "That\u2019s the usual way of doing business.\u201d Lights were then procured; and Messrs.",
        "Blathers and Duff, attended by the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.",
        "This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.",
        "Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night\u2019s adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last.",
        "This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child\u2019s play.",
        "Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and Mrs.",
        "Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.",
        "\u201cUpon my word,\u201d he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns, \u201cI hardly know what to do.\u201d \u201cSurely,\u201d said Rose, \u201cthe poor child\u2019s story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\u201d \u201cI doubt it, my dear young lady,\u201d said the doctor, shaking his head.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade.",
        "What is he, after all, they would say? A runaway.",
        "Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.\u201d \u201cYou believe it, surely?\u201d interrupted Rose.",
        "\u201c_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,\u201d rejoined the doctor; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it is exactly the tale for a practical police officer, nevertheless.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d demanded Rose.",
        "\u201cBecause, my pretty cross examiner,\u201d replied the doctor: \u201cbecause, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.",
        "Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted.",
        "On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\u2019s pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\u2019s house, to a place which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea.",
        "He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\u2019t you see all this?\u201d \u201cI see it, of course,\u201d replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\u2019s impetuosity; \u201cbut still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cof course not! Bless the bright eyes of your sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.\u201d Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before.",
        "\u201cThe more I think of it,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthe more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy\u2019s real story.",
        "I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.\u201d \u201cOh! what is to be done?\u201d cried Rose.",
        "\u201cDear, dear! why did they send for these people?\u201d \u201cWhy, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cI would not have had them here, for the world.\u201d \u201cAll I know is,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness, \u201cthat we must try and carry it off with a bold face.",
        "The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.",
        "The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that\u2019s one comfort.",
        "We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours.",
        "Come in!\u201d \u201cWell, master,\u201d said Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more.",
        "\u201cThis warn\u2019t a put up thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what the devil\u2019s a put up thing?\u201d demanded the doctor, impatiently.",
        "\u201cWe call it a put up robbery, ladies,\u201d said Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\u2019s, \u201cwhen the servants is in it.\u201d \u201cNobody suspected them, in this case,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cWery likely not, ma\u2019am,\u201d replied Blathers; \u201cbut they might have been in it, for all that.\u201d \u201cMore likely on that wery account,\u201d said Duff.",
        "\u201cWe find it was a town hand,\u201d said Blathers, continuing his report; \u201cfor the style of work is first rate.\u201d \u201cWery pretty indeed it is,\u201d remarked Duff, in an undertone.",
        "\u201cThere was two of \u2019em in it,\u201d continued Blathers; \u201cand they had a boy with \u2019em; that\u2019s plain from the size of the window.",
        "That\u2019s all to be said at present.",
        "We\u2019ll see this lad that you\u2019ve got upstairs at once, if you please.\u201d \u201cPerhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs.",
        "Maylie?\u201d said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him.",
        "\u201cOh! to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Rose, eagerly.",
        "\u201cYou shall have it immediately, if you will.\u201d \u201cWhy, thank you, miss!\u201d said Blathers, drawing his coat sleeve across his mouth; \u201cit\u2019s dry work, this sort of duty.",
        "Anythink that\u2019s handy, miss; don\u2019t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\u201d \u201cWhat shall it be?\u201d asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard.",
        "\u201cA little drop of spirits, master, if it\u2019s all the same,\u201d replied Blathers.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a cold ride from London, ma\u2019am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\u201d This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs.",
        "Maylie, who received it very graciously.",
        "While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Blathers: not holding his wine glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest; \u201cI have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.\u201d \u201cThat crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Duff, assisting his colleague\u2019s memory.",
        "\u201cThat was something in this way, warn\u2019t it?\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Blathers; \u201cthat was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\u201d \u201cYou always gave that to him\u201d replied Duff.",
        "\u201cIt was the Family Pet, I tell you.",
        "Conkey hadn\u2019t any more to do with it than I had.\u201d \u201cGet out!\u201d retorted Mr.",
        "Blathers; \u201cI know better.",
        "Do you mind that time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was! Better than any novel book _I_ ever see!\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of good humour in the unwelcome visitors.",
        "\u201cIt was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,\u201d said Blathers.",
        "\u201cThis here Conkey Chickweed\u2014\u201d \u201cConkey means Nosey, ma\u2019am,\u201d interposed Duff.",
        "\u201cOf course the lady knows that, don\u2019t she?\u201d demanded Mr.",
        "Blathers.",
        "\u201cAlways interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a public house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock fighting, and badger drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I\u2019ve seen \u2019em off\u2019en.",
        "He warn\u2019t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story high.",
        "He was wery quick about it.",
        "But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood.",
        "They set up a hue and cry, directly, and when they came to look about \u2019em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \u2019em.",
        "However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.",
        "Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\u2019t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself.",
        "One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr.",
        "Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house.",
        "\u2018I see him, Spyers,\u2019 said Chickweed, \u2018pass my house yesterday morning,\u2019 \u2018Why didn\u2019t you up, and collar him!\u2019 says Spyers.",
        "\u2018I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\u2019 says the poor man; \u2018but we\u2019re sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o\u2019clock at night he passed again.\u2019 Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\u2019s notice.",
        "He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, \u2018Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\u2019 Jem Spyers dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a tearing down the street full cry.",
        "Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, \u2018Thieves!\u2019 and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad.",
        "Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \u2018Which is the man?\u2019 \u2018D\u2014me!\u2019 says Chickweed, \u2018I\u2019ve lost him again!\u2019 It was a remarkable occurrence, but he warn\u2019t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public house.",
        "Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again.",
        "At last, he couldn\u2019t help shutting \u2019em, to ease \u2019em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed a roaring out, \u2018Here he is!\u2019 Off he starts once more, with Chickweed half way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday\u2019s one, the man\u2019s lost again! This was done, once or twice more, till one half the neighbours gave out that Mr.",
        "Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr.",
        "Chickweed had gone mad with grief.\u201d \u201cWhat did Jem Spyers say?\u201d inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story.",
        "\u201cJem Spyers,\u201d resumed the officer, \u201cfor a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business.",
        "But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says \u2018Chickweed, I\u2019ve found out who done this here robbery.\u2019 \u2018Have you?\u2019 said Chickweed.",
        "\u2018Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!\u2019 \u2018Come!\u2019 said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, \u2018none of that gammon! You did it yourself.\u2019 So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he hadn\u2019t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Blathers, putting down his wine glass, and clinking the handcuffs together.",
        "\u201cVery curious, indeed,\u201d observed the doctor.",
        "\u201cNow, if you please, you can walk upstairs.\u201d \u201cIf _you_ please, sir,\u201d returned Mr.",
        "Blathers.",
        "Closely following Mr.",
        "Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\u2019s bedroom; Mr.",
        "Giles preceding the party, with a lighted candle.",
        "Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet.",
        "Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward\u2014in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing.",
        "\u201cThis,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding, \u201cthis is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring gun in some boyish trespass on Mr.",
        "What d\u2019 ye call him\u2019s grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\u201d Messrs.",
        "Blathers and Duff looked at Mr.",
        "Giles, as he was thus recommended to their notice.",
        "The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr.",
        "Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.",
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to deny that, I suppose?\u201d said the doctor, laying Oliver gently down again.",
        "\u201cIt was all done for the\u2014for the best, sir,\u201d answered Giles.",
        "\u201cI am sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\u2019t have meddled with him.",
        "I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.\u201d \u201cThought it was what boy?\u201d inquired the senior officer.",
        "\u201cThe housebreaker\u2019s boy, sir!\u201d replied Giles.",
        "\u201cThey\u2014they certainly had a boy.\u201d \u201cWell? Do you think so now?\u201d inquired Blathers.",
        "\u201cThink what, now?\u201d replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.",
        "\u201cThink it\u2019s the same boy, Stupid head?\u201d rejoined Blathers, impatiently.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know; I really don\u2019t know,\u201d said Giles, with a rueful countenance.",
        "\u201cI couldn\u2019t swear to him.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Blathers.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d replied poor Giles.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think it is the boy; indeed, I\u2019m almost certain that it isn\u2019t.",
        "You know it can\u2019t be.\u201d \u201cHas this man been a drinking, sir?\u201d inquired Blathers, turning to the doctor.",
        "\u201cWhat a precious muddle headed chap you are!\u201d said Duff, addressing Mr.",
        "Giles, with supreme contempt.",
        "Losberne had been feeling the patient\u2019s pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.",
        "Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where Mr.",
        "Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he shouldn\u2019t know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr.",
        "Giles had said he was; and that Mr.",
        "Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty.",
        "Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr.",
        "Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before.",
        "Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on Mr.",
        "Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.",
        "Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.",
        "With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs.",
        "Blathers and Duff journeyed accordingly.",
        "The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\u2019s subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs.",
        "Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went.",
        "In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of Mrs.",
        "Maylie and Mr.",
        "Losberne for Oliver\u2019s appearance if he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great Mr.",
        "Conkey Chickweed.",
        "Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of Mrs.",
        "Maylie, Rose, and the kind hearted Mr.",
        "Losberne.",
        "If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven\u2014and if they be not, what prayers are!\u2014the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.",
        "CHAPTER XXXII.",
        "OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS Oliver\u2019s ailings were neither slight nor few.",
        "In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly.",
        "But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.",
        "\u201cPoor fellow!\u201d said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; \u201cyou shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.",
        "We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us.",
        "The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.",
        "We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.\u201d \u201cThe trouble!\u201d cried Oliver.",
        "\u201cOh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!\u201d \u201cYou shall give nothing at all,\u201d said Miss Maylie, smiling; \u201cfor, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.\u201d \u201cHappy, ma\u2019am!\u201d cried Oliver; \u201chow kind of you to say so!\u201d \u201cYou will make me happier than I can tell you,\u201d replied the young lady.",
        "\u201cTo think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine.",
        "Do you understand me?\u201d she inquired, watching Oliver\u2019s thoughtful face.",
        "\u201cOh yes, ma\u2019am, yes!\u201d replied Oliver eagerly; \u201cbut I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.\u201d \u201cTo whom?\u201d inquired the young lady.",
        "\u201cTo the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,\u201d rejoined Oliver.",
        "\u201cIf they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.\u201d \u201cI am sure they would,\u201d rejoined Oliver\u2019s benefactress; \u201cand Mr.",
        "Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.\u201d \u201cHas he, ma\u2019am?\u201d cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!\u201d In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition.",
        "One morning he and Mr.",
        "Losberne set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "When they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the boy?\u201d cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle.",
        "\u201cDo you see anything\u2014hear anything\u2014feel anything\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cThat, sir,\u201d cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window.",
        "\u201cThat house!\u201d \u201cYes; well, what of it? Stop coachman.",
        "Pull up here,\u201d cried the doctor.",
        "\u201cWhat of the house, my man; eh?\u201d \u201cThe thieves\u2014the house they took me to!\u201d whispered Oliver.",
        "\u201cThe devil it is!\u201d cried the doctor.",
        "\u201cHallo, there! let me out!\u201d But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.",
        "\u201cHalloa?\u201d said a little ugly hump backed man: opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here?\u201d \u201cMatter!\u201d exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment\u2019s reflection.",
        "\u201cA good deal.",
        "Robbery is the matter.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019ll be Murder the matter, too,\u201d replied the hump backed man, coolly, \u201cif you don\u2019t take your hands off.",
        "Do you hear me?\u201d \u201cI hear you,\u201d said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.",
        "\u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014confound the fellow, what\u2019s his rascally name\u2014Sikes; that\u2019s it.",
        "Where\u2019s Sikes, you thief?\u201d The hump backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor\u2019s grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house.",
        "Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley.",
        "He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered Oliver\u2019s description! \u201cNow!\u201d said the hump backed man, who had watched him keenly, \u201cwhat do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?\u201d \u201cDid you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?\u201d said the irritable doctor.",
        "\u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d demanded the hunchback.",
        "\u201cWill you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!\u201d \u201cAs soon as I think proper,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver\u2019s account of it.",
        "\u201cI shall find you out, some day, my friend.\u201d \u201cWill you?\u201d sneered the ill favoured cripple.",
        "\u201cIf you ever want me, I\u2019m here.",
        "I haven\u2019t lived here mad and all alone, for five and twenty years, to be scared by you.",
        "You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.\u201d And so saying, the mis shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.",
        "\u201cStupid enough, this,\u201d muttered the doctor to himself; \u201cthe boy must have made a mistake.",
        "Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.\u201d With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage.",
        "The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as Mr.",
        "Losberne turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards.",
        "He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.",
        "\u201cI am an ass!\u201d said the doctor, after a long silence.",
        "\u201cDid you know that before, Oliver?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cThen don\u2019t forget it another time.\u201d \u201cAn ass,\u201d said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes.",
        "\u201cEven if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single handed? And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business.",
        "That would have served me right, though.",
        "I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse.",
        "It might have done me good.\u201d Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him.",
        "If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver\u2019s story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.",
        "He soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver\u2019s replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.",
        "As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr.",
        "Brownlow resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither.",
        "When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.",
        "\u201cNow, my boy, which house is it?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Losberne.",
        "\u201cThat! That!\u201d replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.",
        "\u201cThe white house.",
        "Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.\u201d \u201cCome, come!\u201d said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.",
        "\u201cYou will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.\u201d \u201cOh! I hope so!\u201d cried Oliver.",
        "\u201cThey were so good to me; so very, very good to me.\u201d The coach rolled on.",
        "It stopped.",
        "No; that was the wrong house; the next door.",
        "It went on a few paces, and stopped again.",
        "Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.",
        "Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.",
        "\u201cTo Let.\u201d \u201cKnock at the next door,\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Losberne, taking Oliver\u2019s arm in his.",
        "\u201cWhat has become of Mr.",
        "Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?\u201d The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.",
        "She presently returned, and said, that Mr.",
        "Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to the West Indies, six weeks before.",
        "Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward.",
        "\u201cHas his housekeeper gone too?\u201d inquired Mr.",
        "Losberne, after a moment\u2019s pause.",
        "\u201cYes, sir\u201d; replied the servant.",
        "\u201cThe old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s, all went together.\u201d \u201cThen turn towards home again,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne to the driver; \u201cand don\u2019t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded London!\u201d \u201cThe book stall keeper, sir?\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cI know the way there.",
        "See him, pray, sir! Do see him!\u201d \u201cMy poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cQuite enough for both of us.",
        "If we go to the book stall keeper\u2019s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away.",
        "No; home again straight!\u201d And in obedience to the doctor\u2019s impulse, home they went.",
        "This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr.",
        "Brownlow and Mrs.",
        "Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them.",
        "The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber\u2014a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day\u2014was almost more than he could bear.",
        "The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors.",
        "After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at Chertsey, for some months.",
        "Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin\u2019s cupidity, to the banker\u2019s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them.",
        "Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature\u2019s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being.",
        "Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.",
        "Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.",
        "It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.",
        "Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.",
        "The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours.",
        "Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest.",
        "Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain.",
        "It was a happy time.",
        "The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.",
        "Every morning he went to a white headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to please him.",
        "Then, he would walk with Mrs.",
        "Maylie and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters.",
        "Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.",
        "When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.",
        "There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture.",
        "And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing without: and the sweet smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance.",
        "The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to Oliver\u2019s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before.",
        "Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.",
        "In the morning, Oliver would be a foot by six o\u2019clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast table.",
        "There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie\u2019s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste.",
        "When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good will, until Miss Rose made her appearance: when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.",
        "So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver\u2019s were true felicity.",
        "With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.",
        "CHAPTER XXXIII.",
        "WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came.",
        "If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness.",
        "The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond.",
        "The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad.",
        "It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.",
        "Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.",
        "Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people.",
        "He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.",
        "One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing.",
        "Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds.",
        "Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home.",
        "The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual.",
        "After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.",
        "\u201cRose, my dear!\u201d said the elder lady.",
        "Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts.",
        "\u201cRose, my love!\u201d cried Mrs.",
        "Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her.",
        "\u201cWhat is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?\u201d \u201cNothing, aunt; nothing,\u201d replied the young lady.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is; I can\u2019t describe it; but I feel\u2014\u201d \u201cNot ill, my love?\u201d interposed Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cNo, no! Oh, not ill!\u201d replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; \u201cI shall be better presently.",
        "Close the window, pray!\u201d Oliver hastened to comply with her request.",
        "The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys.",
        "Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress.",
        "\u201cMy child!\u201d said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, \u201cI never saw you so before.\u201d \u201cI would not alarm you if I could avoid it,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cbut indeed I have tried very hard, and cannot help this.",
        "I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.\u201d She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness.",
        "Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before.",
        "Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.",
        "Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale.",
        "Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health: assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.",
        "\u201cI hope,\u201d said Oliver, when Mrs.",
        "Maylie returned, \u201cthat nothing is the matter? She don\u2019t look well tonight, but\u2014\u201d The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time.",
        "At length, she said, in a trembling voice: \u201cI hope not, Oliver.",
        "I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps.",
        "It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Oliver.",
        "\u201cThe heavy blow,\u201d said the old lady, \u201cof losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.\u201d \u201cOh! God forbid!\u201d exclaimed Oliver, hastily.",
        "\u201cAmen to that, my child!\u201d said the old lady, wringing her hands.",
        "\u201cSurely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cTwo hours ago, she was quite well.\u201d \u201cShe is very ill now,\u201d rejoined Mrs.",
        "Maylie; \u201cand will be worse, I am sure.",
        "My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!\u201d She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.",
        "\u201cAnd consider, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary.",
        "\u201cOh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her.",
        "I am sure\u2014certain\u2014quite certain\u2014that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die.",
        "Heaven will never let her die so young.\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver\u2019s head.",
        "\u201cYou think like a child, poor boy.",
        "But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.",
        "I had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.",
        "I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.",
        "God\u2019s will be done! I love her; and He knows how well!\u201d Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs.",
        "Maylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm.",
        "He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, Mrs.",
        "Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.",
        "But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.",
        "How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves? An anxious night ensued.",
        "When morning came, Mrs.",
        "Maylie\u2019s predictions were but too well verified.",
        "Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever.",
        "\u201cWe must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face; \u201cthis letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr.",
        "Losberne.",
        "It must be carried to the market town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey.",
        "The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.\u201d Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.",
        "\u201cHere is another letter,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, pausing to reflect; \u201cbut whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely know.",
        "I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.\u201d \u201cIs it for Chertsey, too, ma\u2019am?\u201d inquired Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically.",
        "Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some great lord\u2019s house in the country; where, he could not make out.",
        "\u201cShall it go, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.",
        "\u201cI think not,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Maylie, taking it back.",
        "\u201cI will wait until tomorrow.\u201d With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.",
        "Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market place of the market town.",
        "Here he paused, and looked about for the inn.",
        "There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign of \u201cThe George.\u201d To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.",
        "He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick.",
        "This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more.",
        "Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage.",
        "At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike road, in a couple of minutes.",
        "As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn yard, with a somewhat lighter heart.",
        "He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door.",
        "\u201cHah!\u201d cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling.",
        "\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s this?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, sir,\u201d said Oliver; \u201cI was in a great hurry to get home, and didn\u2019t see you were coming.\u201d \u201cDeath!\u201d muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes.",
        "\u201cWho would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He\u2019d start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!\u201d \u201cI am sorry,\u201d stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man\u2019s wild look.",
        "\u201cI hope I have not hurt you!\u201d \u201cRot you!\u201d murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth; \u201cif I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night.",
        "Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp! What are you doing here?\u201d The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently.",
        "He advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.",
        "Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.",
        "Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.",
        "The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.",
        "Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid night she was delirious.",
        "A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs.",
        "Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature.",
        "\u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.\u201d How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred! And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave\u2019s verge! Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them! Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still.",
        "People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears.",
        "All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside.",
        "Late that night, Mr.",
        "Losberne arrived.",
        "\u201cIt is hard,\u201d said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; \u201cso young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.\u201d Another morning.",
        "The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast.",
        "Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.",
        "There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance.",
        "He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds.",
        "A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.",
        "Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service.",
        "A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young.",
        "They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother\u2014a mother once\u2014among the weeping train.",
        "But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.",
        "Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.",
        "He had no cause for self reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.",
        "We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done\u2014of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired! There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.",
        "When he reached home Mrs.",
        "Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.",
        "Oliver\u2019s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away.",
        "He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.",
        "They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.",
        "The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure.",
        "Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep.",
        "They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr.",
        "Losberne entered.",
        "\u201cWhat of Rose?\u201d cried the old lady.",
        "\u201cTell me at once! I can bear it; anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!\u201d \u201cYou must compose yourself,\u201d said the doctor supporting her.",
        "\u201cBe calm, my dear ma\u2019am, pray.\u201d \u201cLet me go, in God\u2019s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d cried the doctor, passionately.",
        "\u201cAs He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.\u201d The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her.",
        "CHAPTER XXXIV.",
        "CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVER It was almost too much happiness to bear.",
        "Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest.",
        "He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.",
        "The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber.",
        "As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.",
        "Looking round, he saw that it was a post chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him.",
        "As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person.",
        "In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses.",
        "Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver by his name.",
        "\u201cHere!\u201d cried the voice.",
        "\u201cOliver, what\u2019s the news? Miss Rose! Master O li ver!\u201d \u201cIs it you, Giles?\u201d cried Oliver, running up to the chaise door.",
        "Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.",
        "\u201cIn a word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cBetter or worse?\u201d \u201cBetter\u2014much better!\u201d replied Oliver, hastily.",
        "\u201cThank Heaven!\u201d exclaimed the gentleman.",
        "\u201cYou are sure?\u201d \u201cQuite, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cThe change took place only a few hours ago; and Mr.",
        "Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.\u201d The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise door, leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.",
        "\u201cYou are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?\u201d demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.",
        "\u201cDo not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.\u201d \u201cI would not for the world, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cIndeed you may believe me.",
        "Losberne\u2019s words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come.",
        "I heard him say so.\u201d The tears stood in Oliver\u2019s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.",
        "Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark\u2014for he could well guess what his feelings were\u2014and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.",
        "All this time, Mr.",
        "Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket handkerchief dotted with white spots.",
        "That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.",
        "\u201cI think you had better go on to my mother\u2019s in the chaise, Giles,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cI would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her.",
        "You can say I am coming.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, Mr.",
        "Harry,\u201d said Giles: giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; \u201cbut if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.",
        "It wouldn\u2019t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, \u201cyou can do as you like.",
        "Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.",
        "Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise.",
        "This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr.",
        "Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.",
        "As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer.",
        "He seemed about five and twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing.",
        "Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.",
        "Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage.",
        "The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides.",
        "\u201cMother!\u201d whispered the young man; \u201cwhy did you not write before?\u201d \u201cI did,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Maylie; \u201cbut, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard Mr.",
        "Losberne\u2019s opinion.\u201d \u201cBut why,\u201d said the young man, \u201cwhy run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened? If Rose had\u2014I cannot utter that word now\u2014if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!\u201d \u201cIf that _had_ been the case, Harry,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, \u201cI fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.\u201d \u201cAnd who can wonder if it be so, mother?\u201d rejoined the young man; \u201cor why should I say, _if?_\u2014It is\u2014it is\u2014you know it, mother\u2014you must know it!\u201d \u201cI know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie; \u201cI know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.",
        "If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.\u201d \u201cThis is unkind, mother,\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cDo you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?\u201d \u201cI think, my dear son,\u201d returned Mrs.",
        "Maylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder, \u201cthat youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting.",
        "Above all, I think\u201d said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son\u2019s face, \u201cthat if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life.",
        "And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.\u201d \u201cMother,\u201d said the young man, impatiently, \u201che would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.\u201d \u201cYou think so now, Harry,\u201d replied his mother.",
        "\u201cAnd ever will!\u201d said the young man.",
        "\u201cThe mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed.",
        "On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.",
        "I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.",
        "Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.\u201d \u201cHarry,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, \u201cit is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded.",
        "But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.\u201d \u201cLet it rest with Rose, then,\u201d interposed Harry.",
        "\u201cYou will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d rejoined Mrs.",
        "Maylie; \u201cbut I would have you consider\u2014\u201d \u201cI _have_ considered!\u201d was the impatient reply; \u201cMother, I have considered, years and years.",
        "I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection.",
        "My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place, Rose shall hear me.\u201d \u201cShe shall,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cThere is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,\u201d said the young man.",
        "\u201cNot coldly,\u201d rejoined the old lady; \u201cfar from it.\u201d \u201cHow then?\u201d urged the young man.",
        "\u201cShe has formed no other attachment?\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d replied his mother; \u201cyou have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already.",
        "What I would say,\u201d resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, \u201cis this.",
        "Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose\u2019s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cThat I leave you to discover,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cI must go back to her.",
        "God bless you!\u201d \u201cI shall see you again tonight?\u201d said the young man, eagerly.",
        "\u201cBy and by,\u201d replied the lady; \u201cwhen I leave Rose.\u201d \u201cYou will tell her I am here?\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cOf course,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "\u201cAnd say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her.",
        "You will not refuse to do this, mother?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the old lady; \u201cI will tell her all.\u201d And pressing her son\u2019s hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.",
        "Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding.",
        "The former now held out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them.",
        "The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient\u2019s situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver\u2019s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr.",
        "Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears.",
        "\u201cHave you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?\u201d inquired the doctor, when he had concluded.",
        "\u201cNothing particular, sir,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Giles, colouring up to the eyes.",
        "\u201cNor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house breakers?\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cNone at all, sir,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Giles, with much gravity.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cI am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably.",
        "Pray, how is Brittles?\u201d \u201cThe boy is very well, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Giles, recovering his usual tone of patronage; \u201cand sends his respectful duty, sir.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cSeeing you here, reminds me, Mr.",
        "Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour.",
        "Just step into this corner a moment, will you?\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness.",
        "The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for Mr.",
        "Giles walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings bank, the sum of five and twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.",
        "At this, the two women servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr.",
        "Giles, pulling out his shirt frill, replied, \u201cNo, no\u201d; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so.",
        "And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.",
        "Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman\u2019s good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.",
        "So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.",
        "Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days.",
        "The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty.",
        "The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.",
        "The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright.",
        "Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.",
        "Men who look on nature, and their fellow men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.",
        "The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.",
        "It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone.",
        "Harry Maylie, after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.",
        "If Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed.",
        "The window of the young lady\u2019s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning.",
        "Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning\u2019s walk.",
        "Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.",
        "Nor did Oliver\u2019s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with Mrs.",
        "Maylie.",
        "He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself.",
        "It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.",
        "The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground floor, at the back of the house.",
        "It was quite a cottage room, with a lattice window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume.",
        "It looked into a garden, whence a wicket gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow land and wood.",
        "There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.",
        "One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books.",
        "He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.",
        "There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.",
        "So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two.",
        "Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.",
        "It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.",
        "Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside.",
        "And yet he was asleep.",
        "Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew\u2019s house again.",
        "There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him.",
        "\u201cHush, my dear!\u201d he thought he heard the Jew say; \u201cit is he, sure enough.",
        "Come away.\u201d \u201cHe!\u201d the other man seemed to answer; \u201ccould I mistake him, think you? If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out.",
        "If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn\u2019t a mark above it, that he lay buried there?\u201d The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up.",
        "Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There\u2014there\u2014at the window\u2014close before him\u2014so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn yard.",
        "It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone.",
        "But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth.",
        "He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help.",
        "CHAPTER XXXV.",
        "CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER\u2019S ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver\u2019s cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words, \u201cThe Jew! the Jew!\u201d Mr.",
        "Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard Oliver\u2019s history from his mother, understood it at once.",
        "\u201cWhat direction did he take?\u201d he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner.",
        "\u201cThat,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; \u201cI missed them in an instant.\u201d \u201cThen, they are in the ditch!\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cFollow! And keep as near me, as you can.\u201d So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him.",
        "Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, Mr.",
        "Losberne, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.",
        "On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to Mr.",
        "Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.",
        "The search was all in vain.",
        "There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen.",
        "They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.",
        "There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time.",
        "A thick wood skirted the meadow land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason.",
        "\u201cIt must have been a dream, Oliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie.",
        "\u201cOh no, indeed, sir,\u201d replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch\u2019s countenance; \u201cI saw him too plainly for that.",
        "I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.\u201d \u201cWho was the other?\u201d inquired Harry and Mr.",
        "Losberne, together.",
        "\u201cThe very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cWe had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.\u201d \u201cThey took this way?\u201d demanded Harry: \u201care you sure?\u201d \u201cAs I am that the men were at the window,\u201d replied Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage garden from the meadow.",
        "\u201cThe tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.\u201d The two gentlemen watched Oliver\u2019s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said.",
        "Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.",
        "The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it.",
        "The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men\u2019s shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before.",
        "\u201cThis is strange!\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cStrange?\u201d echoed the doctor.",
        "\u201cBlathers and Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.\u201d Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.",
        "Giles was dispatched to the different ale houses in the village, furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers.",
        "Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.",
        "On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success.",
        "On the day following, Oliver and Mr.",
        "Maylie repaired to the market town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.",
        "After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.",
        "Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.",
        "She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all.",
        "But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there: even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark.",
        "Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face.",
        "After Mr.",
        "Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.",
        "At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast parlour, Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments.",
        "\u201cA few\u2014a very few\u2014will suffice, Rose,\u201d said the young man, drawing his chair towards her.",
        "\u201cWhat I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.\u201d Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness.",
        "She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.",
        "\u201cI\u2014I\u2014ought to have left here, before,\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cYou should, indeed,\u201d replied Rose.",
        "\u201cForgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.\u201d \u201cI was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,\u201d said the young man; \u201cthe fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.",
        "You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven.",
        "We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.\u201d There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.",
        "\u201cA creature,\u201d continued the young man, passionately, \u201ca creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of God\u2019s own angels, fluttered between life and death.",
        "Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you\u2014these were distractions almost too great to bear.",
        "They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course.",
        "You recovered.",
        "Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide.",
        "I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection.",
        "Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.\u201d \u201cI did not mean that,\u201d said Rose, weeping; \u201cI only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.\u201d \u201cThere is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,\u201d said the young man, taking her hand.",
        "\u201cRose, my own dear Rose! For years\u2014for years\u2014I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy\u2019s attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.\u201d \u201cYour behaviour has ever been kind and noble.\u201d said Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated.",
        "\u201cAs you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.\u201d \u201cIt is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d replied Rose, \u201cthat you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love.",
        "Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there.",
        "Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.\u201d There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears.",
        "Harry still retained the other.",
        "\u201cAnd your reasons, Rose,\u201d he said, at length, in a low voice; \u201cyour reasons for this decision?\u201d \u201cYou have a right to know them,\u201d rejoined Rose.",
        "\u201cYou can say nothing to alter my resolution.",
        "It is a duty that I must perform.",
        "I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.\u201d \u201cTo yourself?\u201d \u201cYes, Harry.",
        "I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.",
        "I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.\u201d \u201cIf your inclinations chime with your sense of duty\u2014\u201d Harry began.",
        "\u201cThey do not,\u201d replied Rose, colouring deeply.",
        "\u201cThen you return my love?\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cSay but that, dear Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!\u201d \u201cIf I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,\u201d rejoined Rose, \u201cI could have\u2014\u201d \u201cHave received this declaration very differently?\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cDo not conceal that from me, at least, Rose.\u201d \u201cI could,\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cStay!\u201d she added, disengaging her hand, \u201cwhy should we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness.",
        "Farewell, Harry! As we have met today, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!\u201d \u201cAnother word, Rose,\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cYour reason in your own words.",
        "From your own lips, let me hear it!\u201d \u201cThe prospect before you,\u201d answered Rose, firmly, \u201cis a brilliant one.",
        "All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you.",
        "But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother\u2019s place.",
        "In a word,\u201d said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, \u201cthere is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.",
        "I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.\u201d \u201cOne word more, Rose.",
        "Dearest Rose! one more!\u201d cried Harry, throwing himself before her.",
        "\u201cIf I had been less\u2014less fortunate, the world would call it\u2014if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny\u2014if I had been poor, sick, helpless\u2014would you have turned from me then? Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?\u201d \u201cDo not press me to reply,\u201d answered Rose.",
        "\u201cThe question does not arise, and never will.",
        "It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.\u201d \u201cIf your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,\u201d retorted Harry, \u201cit will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me.",
        "It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.",
        "Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!\u201d \u201cThen, if your lot had been differently cast,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cif you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial.",
        "I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.\u201d Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her.",
        "\u201cI cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,\u201d said Rose, extending her hand.",
        "\u201cI must leave you now, indeed.\u201d \u201cI ask one promise,\u201d said Harry.",
        "\u201cOnce, and only once more,\u2014say within a year, but it may be much sooner,\u2014I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.\u201d \u201cNot to press me to alter my right determination,\u201d replied Rose, with a melancholy smile; \u201cit will be useless.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Harry; \u201cto hear you repeat it, if you will\u2014finally repeat it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.\u201d \u201cThen let it be so,\u201d rejoined Rose; \u201cit is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.\u201d She extended her hand again.",
        "But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.",
        "CHAPTER XXXVI.",
        "IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES \u201cAnd so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?\u201d said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the breakfast table.",
        "\u201cWhy, you are not in the same mind or intention two half hours together!\u201d \u201cYou will tell me a different tale one of these days,\u201d said Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason.",
        "\u201cI hope I may have good cause to do so,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Losberne; \u201cthough I confess I don\u2019t think I shall.",
        "But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea side.",
        "Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to London.",
        "And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds.",
        "Too bad, isn\u2019t it, Oliver?\u201d \u201cI should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr.",
        "Maylie went away, sir,\u201d rejoined Oliver.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s a fine fellow,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cyou shall come and see me when you return.",
        "But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?\u201d \u201cThe great nobs,\u201d replied Harry, \u201cunder which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cyou are a queer fellow.",
        "But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life.",
        "There\u2019s something in that.",
        "Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.\u201d Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying, \u201cWe shall see,\u201d and pursued the subject no farther.",
        "The post chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed.",
        "\u201cOliver,\u201d said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, \u201clet me speak a word with you.\u201d Oliver walked into the window recess to which Mr.",
        "Maylie beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed.",
        "\u201cYou can write well now?\u201d said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.",
        "\u201cI hope so, sir,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cI shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me\u2014say once a fort night: every alternate Monday: to the General Post Office in London.",
        "Will you?\u201d \u201cOh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,\u201d exclaimed Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission.",
        "\u201cI should like to know how\u2014how my mother and Miss Maylie are,\u201d said the young man; \u201cand you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she\u2014they, I mean\u2014seem happy and quite well.",
        "You understand me?\u201d \u201cOh! quite, sir, quite,\u201d replied Oliver.",
        "\u201cI would rather you did not mention it to them,\u201d said Harry, hurrying over his words; \u201cbecause it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her.",
        "Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.\u201d Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.",
        "Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection.",
        "The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women servants were in the garden, looking on.",
        "Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.",
        "\u201cDrive on!\u201d he cried, \u201chard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, today.\u201d \u201cHalloa!\u201d cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion; \u201csomething very short of flying will keep pace with _me_.",
        "Do you hear?\u201d Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted.",
        "It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.",
        "And there was one looker on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.",
        "\u201cHe seems in high spirits and happy,\u201d she said, at length.",
        "\u201cI feared for a time he might be otherwise.",
        "I was mistaken.",
        "I am very, very glad.\u201d Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose\u2019s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.",
        "CHAPTER XXXVII.",
        "IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES Mr.",
        "Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface.",
        "A paper fly cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net work, Mr.",
        "Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance.",
        "Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life.",
        "Nor was Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator.",
        "There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs.",
        "The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He still wore knee breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches.",
        "The coat was wide skirted; and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.",
        "Bumble was no longer a beadle.",
        "There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them.",
        "A field marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat.",
        "Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they? Men.",
        "Mere men.",
        "Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine.",

        "\u201cIt seems a age.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh\u2014there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.",
        "\u201cI sold myself,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, pursuing the same train of reflection, \u201cfor six teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, and a milk pot; with a small quantity of second hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.",
        "I went very reasonable.",
        "Cheap, dirt cheap!\u201d \u201cCheap!\u201d cried a shrill voice in Mr.",

        "Bumble to himself, \u201cshe can stand anything.",
        "It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.",
        "If it fails with her, my power is gone.\u201d Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs.",
        "Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion.",
        "The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.",
        "On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr.",
        "Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed.",
        "He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.",
        "\u201cAre you going to sit snoring there, all day?\u201d inquired Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cI am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma\u2019am,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble; \u201cand although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.\u201d \u201c_Your_ prerogative!\u201d sneered Mrs.",
        "Bumble, with ineffable contempt.",
        "\u201cI said the word, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Mr.",

        "Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr.",
        "Bumble was a hard hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.",
        "But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s soul; his heart was waterproof.",
        "Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him.",
        "He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.",
        "\u201cIt opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cSo cry away.\u201d As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr.",
        "Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.",
        "Now, Mrs.",
        "Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr.",
        "Bumble was not long in discovering.",
        "The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room.",
        "This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other.",
        "This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose: and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.",
        "\u201cGet up!\u201d said Mrs.",

        "Bumble.",

        "Corney in full possession of the field.",
        "Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.",
        "He had a decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward.",
        "This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.",
        "The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office.",
        "But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.",
        "After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr.",
        "Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.",
        "\u201cHem!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.",
        "\u201cThese women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative.",
        "Hallo! hallo there! What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?\u201d With these words, Mr.",
        "Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.",
        "\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were here.\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t know I was here!\u201d repeated Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWhat do _you_ do here?\u201d \u201cI thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse master\u2019s humility.",
        "\u201c_You_ thought they were talking too much?\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear\u2014\u201d urged Mr.",
        "Bumble submissively.",
        "\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d demanded Mrs.",
        "Bumble, again.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s very true, you\u2019re matron here, my dear,\u201d submitted Mr.",
        "Bumble; \u201cbut I thought you mightn\u2019t be in the way just then.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Mr.",
        "Bumble,\u201d returned his lady.",
        "\u201cWe don\u2019t want any of your interference.",
        "You\u2019re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don\u2019t concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.",
        "Be off; come!\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant.",
        "Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.",
        "What could Mr.",
        "Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.",
        "It wanted but this.",
        "He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen peckery.",
        "\u201cAll in two months!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.",
        "\u201cTwo months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else\u2019s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!\u2014\u201d It was too much.",
        "Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street.",
        "He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty.",
        "He passed a great many public houses; but, at length paused before one in a by way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer.",
        "It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.",
        "This determined him.",
        "Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street.",
        "The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak.",
        "He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance.",
        "He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.",
        "Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin and water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.",
        "It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances: that Mr.",
        "Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him.",
        "Bumble\u2019s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger\u2019s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.",
        "When they had encountered each other\u2019s glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.",
        "\u201cWere you looking for me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen you peered in at the window?\u201d \u201cNot that I am aware of, unless you\u2019re Mr.\u2014\u201d Here Mr.",
        "Bumble stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger\u2019s name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank.",
        "\u201cI see you were not,\u201d said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth; \u201cor you have known my name.",
        "You don\u2019t know it.",
        "I would recommend you not to ask for it.\u201d \u201cI meant no harm, young man,\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Bumble, majestically.",
        "\u201cAnd have done none,\u201d said the stranger.",
        "Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by the stranger.",
        "\u201cI have seen you before, I think?\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYou were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again.",
        "You were beadle here, once; were you not?\u201d \u201cI was,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, in some surprise; \u201cporochial beadle.\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d rejoined the other, nodding his head.",
        "\u201cIt was in that character I saw you.",
        "What are you now?\u201d \u201cMaster of the workhouse,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume.",
        "\u201cMaster of the workhouse, young man!\u201d \u201cYou have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?\u201d resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t scruple to answer freely, man.",
        "I know you pretty well, you see.\u201d \u201cI suppose, a married man,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity, \u201cis not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one.",
        "Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.\u201d The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.",
        "\u201cFill this glass again,\u201d he said, handing Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s empty tumbler to the landlord.",
        "\u201cLet it be strong and hot.",
        "You like it so, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNot too strong,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, with a delicate cough.",
        "\u201cYou understand what that means, landlord!\u201d said the stranger, drily.",
        "The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s eyes.",
        "\u201cNow listen to me,\u201d said the stranger, after closing the door and window.",
        "\u201cI came down to this place, today, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind.",
        "I want some information from you.",
        "I don\u2019t ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.",
        "Put up that, to begin with.\u201d As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without.",
        "When Mr.",
        "Bumble had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat pocket, he went on: \u201cCarry your memory back\u2014let me see\u2014twelve years, last winter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a long time,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cVery good.",
        "I\u2019ve done it.\u201d \u201cThe scene, the workhouse.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d \u201cAnd the time, night.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves\u2014gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot \u2019em in the grave!\u201d \u201cThe lying in room, I suppose?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, not quite following the stranger\u2019s excited description.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said the stranger.",
        "\u201cA boy was born there.\u201d \u201cA many boys,\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.",
        "\u201cA murrain on the young devils!\u201d cried the stranger; \u201cI speak of one; a meek looking, pale faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin maker\u2014I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it\u2014and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\u201d \u201cWhy, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble; \u201cI remember him, of course.",
        "There wasn\u2019t a obstinater young rascal\u2014\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not of him I want to hear; I\u2019ve heard enough of him,\u201d said the stranger, stopping Mr.",
        "Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor Oliver\u2019s vices.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother.",
        "Where is she?\u201d \u201cWhere is she?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, whom the gin and water had rendered facetious.",
        "\u201cIt would be hard to tell.",
        "There\u2019s no midwifery there, whichever place she\u2019s gone to; so I suppose she\u2019s out of employment, anyway.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d demanded the stranger, sternly.",
        "\u201cThat she died last winter,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought.",
        "For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter.",
        "With that he rose, as if to depart.",
        "But Mr.",
        "Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half.",
        "He well remembered the night of old Sally\u2019s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs.",
        "Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman\u2019s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.",
        "Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.",
        "\u201cHow can I find her?\u201d said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence.",
        "\u201cOnly through me,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cWhen?\u201d cried the stranger, hastily.",
        "\u201cTomorrow,\u201d rejoined Bumble.",
        "\u201cAt nine in the evening,\u201d said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water side, in characters that betrayed his agitation; \u201cat nine in the evening, bring her to me there.",
        "I needn\u2019t tell you to be secret.",
        "It\u2019s your interest.\u201d With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk.",
        "Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.",
        "On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name.",
        "The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it.",
        "\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble touched him on the arm.",
        "\u201cFollowing me?\u201d \u201cOnly to ask a question,\u201d said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper.",
        "\u201cWhat name am I to ask for?\u201d \u201cMonks!\u201d rejoined the man; and strode hastily away.",
        "CHAPTER XXXVIII.",
        "CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR.",
        "AND MRS.",
        "BUMBLE, AND MR.",
        "MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.",
        "The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder storm, when Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.",
        "They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation.",
        "The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though\u2014the way being dirty\u2014to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.",
        "They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr.",
        "Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.",
        "This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime.",
        "It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm eaten ship timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river\u2019s bank.",
        "A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.",
        "In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.",
        "It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.",
        "But it had long since gone to ruin.",
        "The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.",
        "It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.",
        "\u201cThe place should be somewhere here,\u201d said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.",
        "\u201cHalloa there!\u201d cried a voice from above.",
        "Following the sound, Mr.",
        "Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast high, on the second story.",
        "\u201cStand still, a minute,\u201d cried the voice; \u201cI\u2019ll be with you directly.\u201d With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.",
        "\u201cIs that the man?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s good lady.",
        "Bumble nodded in the affirmative.",
        "\u201cThen, mind what I told you,\u201d said the matron: \u201cand be careful to say as little as you can, or you\u2019ll betray us at once.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.",
        "\u201cCome in!\u201d he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t keep me here!\u201d The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation.",
        "Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.",
        "\u201cWhat the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?\u201d said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them.",
        "\u201cWe\u2014we were only cooling ourselves,\u201d stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him.",
        "\u201cCooling yourselves!\u201d retorted Monks.",
        "\u201cNot all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell\u2019s fire out, as a man can carry about with him.",
        "You won\u2019t cool yourself so easily; don\u2019t think it!\u201d With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.",
        "\u201cThis is the woman, is it?\u201d demanded Monks.",
        "\u201cHem! That is the woman,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble, mindful of his wife\u2019s caution.",
        "\u201cYou think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?\u201d said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.",
        "\u201cI know they will always keep _one_ till it\u2019s found out,\u201d said Monks.",
        "\u201cAnd what may that be?\u201d asked the matron.",
        "\u201cThe loss of their own good name,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cSo, by the same rule, if a woman\u2019s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I\u2019m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you understand, mistress?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.",
        "\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d said Monks.",
        "\u201cHow should you?\u201d Bestowing something half way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof.",
        "He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre.",
        "\u201cHear it!\u201d he cried, shrinking back.",
        "\u201cHear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it.",
        "I hate the sound!\u201d He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.",
        "Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.",
        "\u201cThese fits come over me, now and then,\u201d said Monks, observing his alarm; \u201cand thunder sometimes brings them on.",
        "Don\u2019t mind me now; it\u2019s all over for this once.\u201d Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, \u201cthe sooner we come to our business, the better for all.",
        "The woman know what it is, does she?\u201d The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.",
        "\u201cHe is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something\u2014\u201d \u201cAbout the mother of the boy you named,\u201d replied the matron interrupting him.",
        "\u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe first question is, of what nature was her communication?\u201d said Monks.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the second,\u201d observed the woman with much deliberation.",
        "\u201cThe first is, what may the communication be worth?\u201d \u201cWho the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?\u201d asked Monks.",
        "\u201cNobody better than you, I am persuaded,\u201d answered Mrs.",
        "Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke fellow could abundantly testify.",
        "\u201cHumph!\u201d said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; \u201cthere may be money\u2019s worth to get, eh?\u201d \u201cPerhaps there may,\u201d was the composed reply.",
        "\u201cSomething that was taken from her,\u201d said Monks.",
        "\u201cSomething that she wore.",
        "Something that\u2014\u201d \u201cYou had better bid,\u201d interrupted Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cI have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.\u201d Mr.",
        "Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s it worth to you?\u201d asked the woman, as collectedly as before.",
        "\u201cIt may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cSpeak out, and let me know which.\u201d \u201cAdd five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five and twenty pounds in gold,\u201d said the woman; \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you all I know.",
        "Not before.\u201d \u201cFive and twenty pounds!\u201d exclaimed Monks, drawing back.",
        "\u201cI spoke as plainly as I could,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not a large sum, either.\u201d \u201cNot a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it\u2019s told!\u201d cried Monks impatiently; \u201cand which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!\u201d \u201cSuch matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,\u201d answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed.",
        "\u201cAs to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!\u201d \u201cWhat if I pay it for nothing?\u201d asked Monks, hesitating.",
        "\u201cYou can easily take it away again,\u201d replied the matron.",
        "\u201cI am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.\u201d \u201cNot alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,\u201d submitted Mr.",
        "Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: \u201c_I_ am here, my dear.",
        "And besides,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, \u201cMr.",
        "Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.",
        "Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; but he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr.",
        "Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I\u2019m once roused.",
        "I only want a little rousing; that\u2019s all.\u201d As Mr.",
        "Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.",
        "\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Bumble, in reply; \u201cand had better hold your tongue.\u201d \u201cHe had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can\u2019t speak in a lower tone,\u201d said Monks, grimly.",
        "\u201cSo! He\u2019s your husband, eh?\u201d \u201cHe my husband!\u201d tittered the matron, parrying the question.",
        "\u201cI thought as much, when you came in,\u201d rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke.",
        "\u201cSo much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there\u2019s only one will between them.",
        "I\u2019m in earnest.",
        "See here!\u201d He thrust his hand into a side pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cgather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house top, is gone, let\u2019s hear your story.\u201d The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.",
        "The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible.",
        "The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.",
        "\u201cWhen this woman, that we called old Sally, died,\u201d the matron began, \u201cshe and I were alone.\u201d \u201cWas there no one by?\u201d asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; \u201cNo sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?\u201d \u201cNot a soul,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cwe were alone.",
        "_I_ stood alone beside the body when death came over it.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said Monks, regarding her attentively.",
        "\u201cGo on.\u201d \u201cShe spoke of a young creature,\u201d resumed the matron, \u201cwho had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.\u201d \u201cAy?\u201d said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, \u201cBlood! How things come about!\u201d \u201cThe child was the one you named to him last night,\u201d said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; \u201cthe mother this nurse had robbed.\u201d \u201cIn life?\u201d asked Monks.",
        "\u201cIn death,\u201d replied the woman, with something like a shudder.",
        "\u201cShe stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant\u2019s sake.\u201d \u201cShe sold it,\u201d cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; \u201cdid she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?\u201d \u201cAs she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,\u201d said the matron, \u201cshe fell back and died.\u201d \u201cWithout saying more?\u201d cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a lie! I\u2019ll not be played with.",
        "She said more.",
        "I\u2019ll tear the life out of you both, but I\u2019ll know what it was.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t utter another word,\u201d said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr.",
        "Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man\u2019s violence; \u201cbut she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.\u201d \u201cWhich contained\u2014\u201d interposed Monks, stretching forward.",
        "\u201cNothing,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cit was a pawnbroker\u2019s duplicate.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d demanded Monks.",
        "\u201cIn good time I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d said the woman.",
        "\u201cI judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker\u2019s interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed.",
        "Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand.",
        "The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.\u201d \u201cWhere is it now?\u201d asked Monks quickly.",
        "\u201c_There_,\u201d replied the woman.",
        "And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.",
        "It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding ring.",
        "\u201cIt has the word \u2018Agnes\u2019 engraved on the inside,\u201d said the woman.",
        "\u201cThere is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born.",
        "I found out that.\u201d \u201cAnd this is all?\u201d said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.",
        "\u201cAll,\u201d replied the woman.",
        "Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five and twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.",
        "\u201cI know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,\u201d said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; \u201cand I want to know nothing; for it\u2019s safer not.",
        "But I may ask you two questions, may I?\u201d \u201cYou may ask,\u201d said Monks, with some show of surprise; \u201cbut whether I answer or not is another question.\u201d \u201c\u2014Which makes three,\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness.",
        "\u201cIs that what you expected to get from me?\u201d demanded the matron.",
        "\u201cIt is,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cThe other question?\u201d \u201cWhat do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d rejoined Monks; \u201cnor against me either.",
        "See here! But don\u2019t move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.\u201d With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap door which opened close at Mr.",
        "Bumble\u2019s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation.",
        "\u201cLook down,\u201d said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t fear me.",
        "I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.\u201d Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr.",
        "Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same.",
        "The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles.",
        "There had once been a water mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.",
        "\u201cIf you flung a man\u2019s body down there, where would it be tomorrow morning?\u201d said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.",
        "\u201cTwelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,\u201d replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought.",
        "Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.",
        "It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.",
        "The three looking into each other\u2019s faces, seemed to breathe more freely.",
        "\u201cThere!\u201d said Monks, closing the trap door, which fell heavily back into its former position.",
        "\u201cIf the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it.",
        "We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Bumble, with great alacrity.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?\u201d said Monks, with a threatening look.",
        "\u201cI am not afraid of your wife.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon me, young man,\u201d answered Mr.",
        "Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.",
        "\u201cOn everybody\u2019s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr.",
        "Monks.\u201d \u201cI am glad, for your sake, to hear it,\u201d remarked Monks.",
        "\u201cLight your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.\u201d It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.",
        "Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.",
        "He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife.",
        "Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.",
        "They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr.",
        "Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap doors.",
        "The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.",
        "They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below.",
        "Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.",
        "CHAPTER XXXIX.",
        "INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr.",
        "William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.",
        "The room in which Mr.",
        "Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings.",
        "It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters: being a mean and badly furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane.",
        "Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\u2019s having gone down in the world of late: for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr.",
        "Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.",
        "The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great coat, by way of dressing gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\u2019s growth.",
        "The dog sat at the bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.",
        "Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber\u2019s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr.",
        "Sikes\u2019s question.",
        "\u201cNot long gone seven,\u201d said the girl.",
        "\u201cHow do you feel tonight, Bill?\u201d \u201cAs weak as water,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs.",
        "\u201cHere; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.\u201d Illness had not improved Mr.",
        "Sikes\u2019s temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her.",
        "\u201cWhining are you?\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cCome! Don\u2019t stand snivelling there.",
        "If you can\u2019t do anything better than that, cut off altogether.",
        "D\u2019ye hear me?\u201d \u201cI hear you,\u201d replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh.",
        "\u201cWhat fancy have you got in your head now?\u201d \u201cOh! you\u2019ve thought better of it, have you?\u201d growled Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye.",
        "\u201cAll the better for you, you have.\u201d \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t mean to say, you\u2019d be hard upon me tonight, Bill,\u201d said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.",
        "\u201cNo!\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "\u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cSuch a number of nights,\u201d said the girl, with a touch of woman\u2019s tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: \u201csuch a number of nights as I\u2019ve been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I\u2019ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\u2019t have served me as you did just now, if you\u2019d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Sikes, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.",
        "Why, damme, now, the girls\u2019s whining again!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d said the girl, throwing herself into a chair.",

        "It\u2019ll soon be over.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019ll be over?\u201d demanded Mr.",
        "Sikes in a savage voice.",
        "\u201cWhat foolery are you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don\u2019t come over me with your woman\u2019s nonsense.\u201d At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before Mr.",
        "Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats.",
        "Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for Miss Nancy\u2019s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr.",
        "Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter here, my dear?\u201d said Fagin, looking in.",
        "\u201cLend a hand to the girl, can\u2019t you?\u201d replied Sikes impatiently.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t stand chattering and grinning at me!\u201d With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\u2019s assistance, while Mr.",
        "John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient\u2019s throat: previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.",
        "\u201cGive her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Dawkins; \u201cand you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.\u201d These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in producing the desired effect.",
        "The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow: leaving Mr.",
        "Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked for appearance.",
        "\u201cWhy, what evil wind has blowed you here?\u201d he asked Fagin.",
        "\u201cNo evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I\u2019ve brought something good with me, that you\u2019ll be glad to see.",
        "Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.\u201d In compliance with Mr.",
        "Fagin\u2019s request, the Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.",
        "\u201cSitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\u201d exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty; \u201csitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\u2019s no occasion to pick \u2019em; half a pound of seven and six penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\u2019ll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn\u2019t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,\u2014oh no! Two half quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo\u2019ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!\u201d Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full sized wine bottle, carefully corked; while Mr.",
        "Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment\u2019s hesitation.",
        "\u201cAh!\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction.",

        "Sikes; \u201cI might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you\u2019d have done anything to help me.",
        "What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false hearted wagabond?\u201d \u201cOnly hear him, boys!\u201d said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.",

        "Sikes: a little soothed as he glanced over the table; \u201cbut what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that \u2019ere dog.\u2014Drive him down, Charley!\u201d \u201cI never see such a jolly dog as that,\u201d cried Master Bates, doing as he was desired.",
        "\u201cSmelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He\u2019d make his fortun\u2019 on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.\u201d \u201cHold your din,\u201d cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily.",
        "\u201cWhat have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?\u201d \u201cI was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\u201d replied the Jew.",

        "\u201cWhat about the other fortnight that you\u2019ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, Bill.",
        "I can\u2019t go into a long explanation before company; but I couldn\u2019t help it, upon my honour.\u201d \u201cUpon your what?\u201d growled Sikes, with excessive disgust.",
        "\u201cHere! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it\u2019ll choke me dead.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be out of temper, my dear,\u201d urged Fagin, submissively.",
        "\u201cI have never forgot you, Bill; never once.\u201d \u201cNo! I\u2019ll pound it that you han\u2019t,\u201d replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work.",
        "If it hadn\u2019t been for the girl, I might have died.\u201d \u201cThere now, Bill,\u201d remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.",
        "\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?\u201d \u201cHe says true enough there!\u201d said Nancy, coming hastily forward.",
        "\u201cLet him be; let him be.\u201d Nancy\u2019s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr.",
        "Sikes into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit bottle, he condescended to make.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all very well,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some blunt from you tonight.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t a piece of coin about me,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cThen you\u2019ve got lots at home,\u201d retorted Sikes; \u201cand I must have some from there.\u201d \u201cLots!\u201d cried Fagin, holding up his hands.",
        "\u201cI haven\u2019t so much as would\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how much you\u2019ve got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cbut I must have some tonight; and that\u2019s flat.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Fagin, with a sigh, \u201cI\u2019ll send the Artful round presently.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t do nothing of the kind,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Sikes.",
        "\u201cThe Artful\u2019s a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it.",
        "Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I\u2019ll lie down and have a snooze while she\u2019s gone.\u201d After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen pence to keep house with; Mr.",
        "Sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldn\u2019t get any more he must accompany him home; with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.",
        "The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by Nancy and the boys: Mr.",
        "Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady\u2019s return.",
        "In due course, they arrived at Fagin\u2019s abode, where they found Toby Crackit and Mr.",
        "Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends.",
        "Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go.",
        "\u201cHas nobody been, Toby?\u201d asked Fagin.",
        "\u201cNot a living leg,\u201d answered Mr.",
        "Crackit, pulling up his collar; \u201cit\u2019s been as dull as swipes.",
        "You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long.",
        "Damme, I\u2019m as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\u2019t had the good natur\u2019 to amuse this youngster.",
        "Horrid dull, I\u2019m blessed if I an\u2019t!\u201d With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr.",
        "Toby Crackit swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr.",
        "Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn\u2019t value his losses the snap of his little finger.",
        "\u201cWot a rum chap you are, Tom!\u201d said Master Bates, highly amused by this declaration.",
        "\u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Chitling.",
        "\u201cAm I, Fagin?\u201d \u201cA very clever fellow, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.",
        "\u201cAnd Mr.",
        "Crackit is a heavy swell; an\u2019t he, Fagin?\u201d asked Tom.",
        "\u201cNo doubt at all of that, my dear.\u201d \u201cAnd it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\u2019t it, Fagin?\u201d pursued Tom.",
        "\u201cVery much so, indeed, my dear.",
        "They\u2019re only jealous, Tom, because he won\u2019t give it to them.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried Tom, triumphantly, \u201cthat\u2019s where it is! He has cleaned me out.",
        "But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\u2019t I, Fagin?\u201d \u201cTo be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up your loss at once, and don\u2019t lose any more time.",
        "Dodger! Charley! It\u2019s time you were on the lay.",
        "Come! It\u2019s near ten, and nothing done yet.\u201d In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr.",
        "Chitling; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar: inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.",
        "Chitling for being seen in good society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said Fagin, when they had left the room, \u201cI\u2019ll go and get you that cash, Nancy.",
        "This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.",
        "I never lock up my money, for I\u2019ve got none to lock up, my dear\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u2014none to lock up.",
        "It\u2019s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\u2019m fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.",
        "Hush!\u201d he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; \u201cwho\u2019s that? Listen!\u201d The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man\u2019s voice reached her ears.",
        "The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table.",
        "The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.",
        "\u201cBah!\u201d he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \u201cit\u2019s the man I expected before; he\u2019s coming downstairs.",
        "Not a word about the money while he\u2019s here, Nance.",
        "He won\u2019t stop long.",
        "Not ten minutes, my dear.\u201d Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man\u2019s step was heard upon the stairs without.",
        "He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.",
        "It was Monks.",
        "\u201cOnly one of my young people,\u201d said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t move, Nancy.\u201d The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.",
        "\u201cAny news?\u201d inquired Fagin.",
        "\u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cAnd\u2014and\u2014good?\u201d asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine.",
        "\u201cNot bad, any way,\u201d replied Monks with a smile.",
        "\u201cI have been prompt enough this time.",
        "Let me have a word with you.\u201d The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.",
        "The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room.",
        "\u201cNot that infernal hole we were in before,\u201d she could hear the man say as they went upstairs.",
        "Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story.",
        "Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest.",
        "The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.",
        "The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending.",
        "Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.",
        "When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.",
        "\u201cWhy, Nance!\u201d exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle, \u201chow pale you are!\u201d \u201cPale!\u201d echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him.",
        "\u201cQuite horrible.",
        "What have you been doing to yourself?\u201d \u201cNothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\u2019t know how long and all,\u201d replied the girl carelessly.",
        "\u201cCome! Let me get back; that\u2019s a dear.\u201d With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand.",
        "They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a \u201cgood night.\u201d When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way.",
        "Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her return, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.",
        "After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.",
        "It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.",
        "If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr.",
        "Sikes, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.",
        "It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment.",
        "That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but Mr.",
        "Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.",
        "As that day closed in, the girl\u2019s excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.",
        "Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him.",
        "\u201cWhy, burn my body!\u201d said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face.",
        "\u201cYou look like a corpse come to life again.",
        "What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cMatter!\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cNothing.",
        "What do you look at me so hard for?\u201d \u201cWhat foolery is this?\u201d demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly.",
        "\u201cWhat is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking of?\u201d \u201cOf many things, Bill,\u201d replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes.",
        "\u201cBut, Lord! What odds in that?\u201d The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them.",
        "\u201cI tell you wot it is,\u201d said Sikes; \u201cif you haven\u2019t caught the fever, and got it comin\u2019 on, now, there\u2019s something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too.",
        "You\u2019re not a going to\u2014.",
        "No, damme! you wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d \u201cDo what?\u201d asked the girl.",
        "\u201cThere ain\u2019t,\u201d said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself; \u201cthere ain\u2019t a stauncher hearted gal going, or I\u2019d have cut her throat three months ago.",
        "She\u2019s got the fever coming on; that\u2019s it.\u201d Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic.",
        "The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d said the robber, \u201ccome and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I\u2019ll alter it so, that you won\u2019t know it agin when you do want it.\u201d The girl obeyed.",
        "Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face.",
        "They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened.",
        "He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.",
        "The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance.",
        "\u201cThe laudanum has taken effect at last,\u201d murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside.",
        "\u201cI may be too late, even now.\u201d She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\u2019s heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber\u2019s lips; and then opening and closing the room door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.",
        "A watchman was crying half past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.",
        "\u201cHas it long gone the half hour?\u201d asked the girl.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019ll strike the hour in another quarter,\u201d said the man: raising his lantern to her face.",
        "\u201cAnd I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\u201d muttered Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.",
        "Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the West End of London.",
        "The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience.",
        "She tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses\u2019 heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like.",
        "\u201cThe woman is mad!\u201d said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away.",
        "When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past.",
        "Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.",
        "It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park.",
        "As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven.",
        "She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall.",
        "The porter\u2019s seat was vacant.",
        "She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.",
        "\u201cNow, young woman!\u201d said a smartly dressed female, looking out from a door behind her, \u201cwho do you want here?\u201d \u201cA lady who is stopping in this house,\u201d answered the girl.",
        "\u201cA lady!\u201d was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look.",
        "\u201cWhat lady?\u201d \u201cMiss Maylie,\u201d said Nancy.",
        "The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her.",
        "To him, Nancy repeated her request.",
        "\u201cWhat name am I to say?\u201d asked the waiter.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s of no use saying any,\u201d replied Nancy.",
        "\u201cNor business?\u201d said the man.",
        "\u201cNo, nor that neither,\u201d rejoined the girl.",
        "\u201cI must see the lady.\u201d \u201cCome!\u201d said the man, pushing her towards the door.",
        "\u201cNone of this.",
        "Take yourself off.\u201d \u201cI shall be carried out if I go!\u201d said the girl violently; \u201cand I can make that a job that two of you won\u2019t like to do.",
        "Isn\u2019t there anybody here,\u201d she said, looking round, \u201cthat will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?\u201d This appeal produced an effect on a good tempered faced man cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere.",
        "\u201cTake it up for her, Joe; can\u2019t you?\u201d said this person.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the good?\u201d replied the man.",
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?\u201d This allusion to Nancy\u2019s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.",
        "\u201cDo what you like with me,\u201d said the girl, turning to the men again; \u201cbut do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty\u2019s sake.\u201d The soft hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s it to be?\u201d said the man, with one foot on the stairs.",
        "\u201cThat a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\u201d said Nancy; \u201cand that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.\u201d \u201cI say,\u201d said the man, \u201cyou\u2019re coming it strong!\u201d \u201cYou give the message,\u201d said the girl firmly; \u201cand let me hear the answer.\u201d The man ran upstairs.",
        "Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no good being proper in this world,\u201d said the first housemaid.",
        "\u201cBrass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\u201d said the second.",
        "The third contented herself with wondering \u201cwhat ladies was made of\u201d; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of \u201cShameful!\u201d with which the Dianas concluded.",
        "Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling.",
        "Here he left her, and retired.",
        "CHAPTER XL.",
        "A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER The girl\u2019s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the woman\u2019s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview.",
        "But struggling with these better feelings was pride,\u2014the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self assured.",
        "The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,\u2014even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child.",
        "She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said: \u201cIt\u2019s a hard matter to get to see you, lady.",
        "If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you\u2019d have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.\u201d \u201cI am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,\u201d replied Rose.",
        "\u201cDo not think of that.",
        "Tell me why you wished to see me.",
        "I am the person you inquired for.\u201d The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.",
        "\u201cOh, lady, lady!\u201d she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face, \u201cif there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,\u2014there would\u2014there would!\u201d \u201cSit down,\u201d said Rose, earnestly.",
        "\u201cIf you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,\u2014I shall indeed.",
        "Sit down.\u201d \u201cLet me stand, lady,\u201d said the girl, still weeping, \u201cand do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better.",
        "It is growing late.",
        "Is\u2014is\u2014that door shut?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it.",
        "\u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands.",
        "I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old Fagin\u2019s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.\u201d \u201cYou!\u201d said Rose Maylie.",
        "\u201cI, lady!\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cI am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady.",
        "I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it.",
        "The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.\u201d \u201cWhat dreadful things are these!\u201d said Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion.",
        "\u201cThank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,\u201d cried the girl, \u201cthat you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and\u2014and\u2014something worse than all\u2014as I have been from my cradle.",
        "I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.\u201d \u201cI pity you!\u201d said Rose, in a broken voice.",
        "\u201cIt wrings my heart to hear you!\u201d \u201cHeaven bless you for your goodness!\u201d rejoined the girl.",
        "\u201cIf you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed.",
        "But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard.",
        "Do you know a man named Monks?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cHe knows you,\u201d replied the girl; \u201cand knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.\u201d \u201cI never heard the name,\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cThen he goes by some other amongst us,\u201d rejoined the girl, \u201cwhich I more than thought before.",
        "Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I\u2014suspecting this man\u2014listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.",
        "I found out, from what I heard, that Monks\u2014the man I asked you about, you know\u2014\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Rose, \u201cI understand.\u201d \u201c\u2014That Monks,\u201d pursued the girl, \u201chad seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn\u2019t make out why.",
        "A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.\u201d \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d asked Rose.",
        "\u201cHe caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,\u201d said the girl; \u201cand there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.",
        "But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.\u201d \u201cAnd what occurred then?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, lady.",
        "Last night he came again.",
        "Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door.",
        "The first words I heard Monks say were these: \u2018So the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.\u2019 They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil\u2019s money safely now, he\u2019d rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father\u2019s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.\u201d \u201cWhat is all this!\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cThe truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cThen, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy\u2019s life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn\u2019t, he\u2019d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet.",
        "\u2018In short, Fagin,\u2019 he says, \u2018Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I\u2019ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\u2019\u201d \u201cHis brother!\u201d exclaimed Rose.",
        "\u201cThose were his words,\u201d said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes haunted her perpetually.",
        "\u201cAnd more.",
        "When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two legged spaniel was.\u201d \u201cYou do not mean,\u201d said Rose, turning very pale, \u201cto tell me that this was said in earnest?\u201d \u201cHe spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head.",
        "\u201cHe is an earnest man when his hatred is up.",
        "I know many who do worse things; but I\u2019d rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once.",
        "It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.",
        "I must get back quickly.\u201d \u201cBut what can I do?\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cTo what use can I turn this communication without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors? If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour\u2019s delay.\u201d \u201cI wish to go back,\u201d said the girl.",
        "\u201cI must go back, because\u2014how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?\u2014because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I can\u2019t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.\u201d \u201cYour having interfered in this dear boy\u2019s behalf before,\u201d said Rose; \u201cyour coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed.",
        "Oh!\u201d said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face, \u201cdo not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first\u2014the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.",
        "Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.\u201d \u201cLady,\u201d cried the girl, sinking on her knees, \u201cdear, sweet, angel lady, you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!\u201d \u201cIt is never too late,\u201d said Rose, \u201cfor penitence and atonement.\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; \u201cI cannot leave him now! I could not be his death.\u201d \u201cWhy should you be?\u201d asked Rose.",
        "\u201cNothing could save him,\u201d cried the girl.",
        "\u201cIf I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die.",
        "He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!\u201d \u201cIs it possible,\u201d cried Rose, \u201cthat for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is madness.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d answered the girl; \u201cI only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself.",
        "I must go back.",
        "Whether it is God\u2019s wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.\u201d \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cI should not let you depart from me thus.\u201d \u201cYou should, lady, and I know you will,\u201d rejoined the girl, rising.",
        "\u201cYou will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.\u201d \u201cOf what use, then, is the communication you have made?\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cThis mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?\u201d \u201cYou must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,\u201d rejoined the girl.",
        "\u201cBut where can I find you again when it is necessary?\u201d asked Rose.",
        "\u201cI do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?\u201d \u201cWill you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?\u201d asked the girl.",
        "\u201cI promise you solemnly,\u201d answered Rose.",
        "\u201cEvery Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,\u201d said the girl without hesitation, \u201cI will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.\u201d \u201cStay another moment,\u201d interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door.",
        "\u201cThink once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it.",
        "You have a claim on me: not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption.",
        "Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!\u201d \u201cWhen ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,\u201d replied the girl steadily, \u201cgive away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths\u2014even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them.",
        "When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? Pity us, lady\u2014pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.\u201d \u201cYou will,\u201d said Rose, after a pause, \u201ctake some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty\u2014at all events until we meet again?\u201d \u201cNot a penny,\u201d replied the girl, waving her hand.",
        "\u201cDo not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,\u201d said Rose, stepping gently forward.",
        "\u201cI wish to serve you indeed.\u201d \u201cYou would serve me best, lady,\u201d replied the girl, wringing her hands, \u201cif you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, tonight, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.",
        "God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!\u201d Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.",
        "CHAPTER XLI.",
        "CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty.",
        "While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which Oliver\u2019s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.",
        "Her words and manner had touched Rose Maylie\u2019s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.",
        "They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.",
        "It was now midnight of the first day.",
        "What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight and forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion? Mr.",
        "Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\u2019s impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver\u2019s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl\u2019s behalf could be seconded by no experienced person.",
        "These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs.",
        "Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject.",
        "As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.",
        "Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when\u2014the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection\u2014he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.",
        "Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night.",
        "After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.",
        "\u201cIf it be painful to him,\u201d she thought, \u201cto come back here, how painful it will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me\u2014he did when he went away.",
        "I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.\u201d And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.",
        "She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr.",
        "Giles for a body guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.",
        "\u201cWhat makes you look so flurried?\u201d asked Rose, advancing to meet him.",
        "\u201cI hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\u201d replied the boy.",
        "\u201cOh dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!\u201d \u201cI never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\u201d said Rose, soothing him.",
        "\u201cBut what is this?\u2014of whom do you speak?\u201d \u201cI have seen the gentleman,\u201d replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate, \u201cthe gentleman who was so good to me\u2014Mr.",
        "Brownlow, that we have so often talked about.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d asked Rose.",
        "\u201cGetting out of a coach,\u201d replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, \u201cand going into a house.",
        "I didn\u2019t speak to him\u2014I couldn\u2019t speak to him, for he didn\u2019t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him.",
        "But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did.",
        "Look here,\u201d said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \u201chere it is; here\u2019s where he lives\u2014I\u2019m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!\u201d With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven Street, in the Strand.",
        "She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account.",
        "\u201cQuick!\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cTell them to fetch a hackney coach, and be ready to go with me.",
        "I will take you there directly, without a minute\u2019s loss of time.",
        "I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.\u201d Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.",
        "When they arrived there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see Mr.",
        "Brownlow on very pressing business.",
        "The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle green coat.",
        "At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.",
        "\u201cDear me,\u201d said the gentleman, in the bottle green coat, hastily rising with great politeness, \u201cI beg your pardon, young lady\u2014I imagined it was some importunate person who\u2014I beg you will excuse me.",
        "Be seated, pray.\u201d \u201cMr.",
        "Brownlow, I believe, sir?\u201d said Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken.",
        "\u201cThat is my name,\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cThis is my friend, Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d interposed Miss Maylie, \u201cthat at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.",
        "If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.\u201d Mr.",
        "Brownlow inclined his head.",
        "Grimwig, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again.",
        "\u201cI shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\u201d said Rose, naturally embarrassed; \u201cbut you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cOliver Twist you knew him as,\u201d replied Rose.",
        "The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr.",
        "Grimwig, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.",
        "Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner.",
        "He drew his chair nearer to Miss Maylie\u2019s, and said, \u201cDo me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\u2019s name put me in possession of it.\u201d \u201cA bad one! I\u2019ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\u201d growled Mr.",
        "Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face.",
        "\u201cHe is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\u201d said Rose, colouring; \u201cand that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m only sixty one,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, with the same rigid face.",
        "\u201cAnd, as the devil\u2019s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don\u2019t see the application of that remark.\u201d \u201cDo not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201che does not mean what he says.\u201d \u201cYes, he does,\u201d growled Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cNo, he does not,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019ll eat his head, if he doesn\u2019t,\u201d growled Mr.",
        "Grimwig.",
        "\u201cHe would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cAnd he\u2019d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\u201d responded Mr.",
        "Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.",
        "Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.",
        "\u201cNow, Miss Maylie,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cto return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested.",
        "Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.\u201d Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s house; reserving Nancy\u2019s information for that gentleman\u2019s private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend.",
        "\u201cThank God!\u201d said the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cThis is great happiness to me, great happiness.",
        "But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie.",
        "You must pardon my finding fault with you,\u2014but why not have brought him?\u201d \u201cHe is waiting in a coach at the door,\u201d replied Rose.",
        "\u201cAt this door!\u201d cried the old gentleman.",
        "With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word.",
        "When the room door closed behind him, Mr.",
        "Grimwig lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time.",
        "After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.",
        "I\u2019m old enough to be your grandfather.",
        "You\u2019re a sweet girl.",
        "I like you.",
        "Here they are!\u201d In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, Mr.",
        "Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr.",
        "Grimwig received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\u2019s behalf, Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.",
        "\u201cThere is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, ringing the bell.",
        "\u201cSend Mrs.",
        "Bedwin here, if you please.\u201d The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.",
        "\u201cWhy, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, rather testily.",
        "\u201cWell, that I do, sir,\u201d replied the old lady.",
        "\u201cPeople\u2019s eyes, at my time of life, don\u2019t improve with age, sir.\u201d \u201cI could have told you that,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cbut put on your glasses, and see if you can\u2019t find out what you were wanted for, will you?\u201d The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles.",
        "But Oliver\u2019s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.",
        "\u201cGod be good to me!\u201d cried the old lady, embracing him; \u201cit is my innocent boy!\u201d \u201cMy dear old nurse!\u201d cried Oliver.",
        "\u201cHe would come back\u2014I knew he would,\u201d said the old lady, holding him in her arms.",
        "\u201cHow well he looks, and how like a gentleman\u2019s son he is dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.",
        "I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.\u201d Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.",
        "Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr.",
        "Brownlow led the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity.",
        "Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend Mr.",
        "Losberne in the first instance.",
        "The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.",
        "To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o\u2019clock that evening, and that in the meantime Mrs.",
        "Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred.",
        "These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.",
        "Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\u2019s wrath.",
        "Nancy\u2019s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs.",
        "Blathers and Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies.",
        "And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\u2019s consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr.",
        "Brownlow, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and partly by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.",
        "\u201cThen what the devil is to be done?\u201d said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies.",
        "\u201cAre we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\u201d \u201cNot exactly that,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Brownlow, laughing; \u201cbut we must proceed gently and with great care.\u201d \u201cGentleness and care,\u201d exclaimed the doctor.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d send them one and all to\u2014\u201d \u201cNever mind where,\u201d interposed Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cBut reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\u201d \u201cWhat object?\u201d asked the doctor.",
        "\u201cSimply, the discovery of Oliver\u2019s parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket handkerchief; \u201cI almost forgot that.\u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cplacing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?\u201d \u201cHanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\u201d suggested the doctor, \u201cand transporting the rest.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, smiling; \u201cbut no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest\u2014or at least to Oliver\u2019s, which is the same thing.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d inquired the doctor.",
        "\u201cThus.",
        "It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon his knees.",
        "That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.",
        "For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him.",
        "He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies.",
        "If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the doctor impetuously, \u201cI put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really\u2014\u201d \u201cDo not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak.",
        "\u201cThe promise shall be kept.",
        "I don\u2019t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings.",
        "But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him.",
        "She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday.",
        "I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\u201d Although Mr.",
        "Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs.",
        "Maylie sided very strongly with Mr.",
        "Brownlow, that gentleman\u2019s proposition was carried unanimously.",
        "\u201cI should like,\u201d he said, \u201cto call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.",
        "He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.\u201d \u201cI have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,\u201d said the doctor.",
        "\u201cWe must put it to the vote,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cwho may he be?\u201d \u201cThat lady\u2019s son, and this young lady\u2019s\u2014very old friend,\u201d said the doctor, motioning towards Mrs.",
        "Maylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece.",
        "Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and Mr.",
        "Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.",
        "\u201cWe stay in town, of course,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, \u201cwhile there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success.",
        "I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cAnd as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate Oliver\u2019s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.",
        "Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough.",
        "Come! Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.\u201d With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs.",
        "Maylie, and escorted her into the supper room.",
        "Losberne followed, leading Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.",
        "CHAPTER XLII.",
        "AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER\u2019S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr.",
        "Sikes to sleep, hurried on her self imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention.",
        "They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female: for the former was one of those long limbed, knock kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,\u2014looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.",
        "The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back.",
        "Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.",
        "This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion.",
        "Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion, \u201cCome on, can\u2019t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy load, I can tell you,\u201d said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue.",
        "\u201cHeavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?\u201d rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder.",
        "\u201cOh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain\u2019t enough to tire anybody\u2019s patience out, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d \u201cIs it much farther?\u201d asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.",
        "\u201cMuch farther! Yer as good as there,\u201d said the long legged tramper, pointing out before him.",
        "\u201cLook there! Those are the lights of London.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re a good two mile off, at least,\u201d said the woman despondingly.",
        "\u201cNever mind whether they\u2019re two mile off, or twenty,\u201d said Noah Claypole; for he it was; \u201cbut get up and come on, or I\u2019ll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.\u201d As Noah\u2019s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.",
        "\u201cWhere do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?\u201d she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards.",
        "\u201cHow should I know?\u201d replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking.",
        "\u201cNear, I hope,\u201d said Charlotte.",
        "\u201cNo, not near,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cThere! Not near; so don\u2019t think it.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cWhen I tell yer that I don\u2019t mean to do a thing, that\u2019s enough, without any why or because either,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Claypole with dignity.",
        "\u201cWell, you needn\u2019t be so cross,\u201d said his companion.",
        "\u201cA pretty thing it would be, wouldn\u2019t it to go and stop at the very first public house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Claypole in a jeering tone.",
        "\u201cNo! I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out of the wayest house I can set eyes on.",
        "Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I\u2019ve got a head; for if we hadn\u2019t gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer\u2019d have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.",
        "And serve yer right for being a fool.\u201d \u201cI know I ain\u2019t as cunning as you are,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut don\u2019t put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.",
        "You would have been if I had been, any way.\u201d \u201cYer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cI took it for you, Noah, dear,\u201d rejoined Charlotte.",
        "\u201cDid I keep it?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cNo; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,\u201d said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his.",
        "This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr.",
        "Claypole\u2019s habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her: which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape.",
        "Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.",
        "In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr.",
        "Claypole went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in earnest.",
        "Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John\u2019s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray\u2019s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of London.",
        "Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose.",
        "At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.",
        "\u201cSo give us the bundle,\u201d said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman\u2019s shoulders, and slinging it over his own; \u201cand don\u2019t yer speak, except when yer spoke to.",
        "What\u2019s the name of the house\u2014t h r\u2014three what?\u201d \u201cCripples,\u201d said Charlotte.",
        "\u201cThree Cripples,\u201d repeated Noah, \u201cand a very good sign too.",
        "Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.\u201d With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion.",
        "There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper.",
        "He stared very hard at Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.",
        "If Noah had been attired in his charity boy\u2019s dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public house.",
        "\u201cIs this the Three Cripples?\u201d asked Noah.",
        "\u201cThat is the dabe of this \u2019ouse,\u201d replied the Jew.",
        "\u201cA gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,\u201d said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.",
        "\u201cWe want to sleep here tonight.\u201d \u201cI\u2019b dot certaid you cad,\u201d said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; \u201cbut I\u2019ll idquire.\u201d \u201cShow us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?\u201d said Noah.",
        "Barney complied by ushering them into a small back room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment.",
        "Now, this back room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation.",
        "The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening\u2019s business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d said Barney: \u201cstradegers id the next roob.\u201d \u201cStrangers!\u201d repeated the old man in a whisper.",
        "\u201cAh! Ad rub uds too,\u201d added Barney.",
        "\u201cFrob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I\u2019b bistaked.\u201d Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.",
        "Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see Mr.",
        "Claypole taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.",
        "\u201cAha!\u201d he whispered, looking round to Barney, \u201cI like that fellow\u2019s looks.",
        "He\u2019d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already.",
        "Don\u2019t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear \u2019em talk\u2014let me hear \u2019em.\u201d He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.",
        "\u201cSo I mean to be a gentleman,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Claypole, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived too late to hear.",
        "\u201cNo more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman\u2019s life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.\u201d \u201cI should like that well enough, dear,\u201d replied Charlotte; \u201cbut tills ain\u2019t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.\u201d \u201cTills be blowed!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Claypole; \u201cthere\u2019s more things besides tills to be emptied.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked his companion.",
        "\u201cPockets, women\u2019s ridicules, houses, mail coaches, banks!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Claypole, rising with the porter.",
        "\u201cBut you can\u2019t do all that, dear,\u201d said Charlotte.",
        "\u201cI shall look out to get into company with them as can,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cThey\u2019ll be able to make us useful some way or another.",
        "Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.\u201d \u201cLor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!\u201d exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.",
        "\u201cThere, that\u2019ll do: don\u2019t yer be too affectionate, in case I\u2019m cross with yer,\u201d said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.",
        "\u201cI should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of \u2019em, and follering \u2019em about, unbeknown to themselves.",
        "That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty pound note you\u2019ve got,\u2014especially as we don\u2019t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.\u201d After expressing this opinion, Mr.",
        "Claypole looked into the porter pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed.",
        "He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.",
        "The stranger was Mr.",
        "Fagin.",
        "And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.",
        "\u201cA pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,\u201d said Fagin, rubbing his hands.",
        "\u201cFrom the country, I see, sir?\u201d \u201cHow do yer see that?\u201d asked Noah Claypole.",
        "\u201cWe have not so much dust as that in London,\u201d replied Fagin, pointing from Noah\u2019s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles.",
        "\u201cYer a sharp feller,\u201d said Noah.",
        "\u201cHa! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!\u201d \u201cWhy, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; \u201cand that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger,\u2014a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose.",
        "However, Mr.",
        "Fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.",
        "\u201cGood stuff that,\u201d observed Mr.",
        "Claypole, smacking his lips.",
        "\u201cDear!\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cA man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman\u2019s reticule, or a house, or a mail coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.\u201d Mr.",
        "Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t mind me, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair closer.",
        "\u201cHa! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance.",
        "It was very lucky it was only me.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t take it,\u201d stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair; \u201cit was all her doing; yer\u2019ve got it now, Charlotte, yer know yer have.\u201d \u201cNo matter who\u2019s got it, or who did it, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk\u2019s eye at the girl and the two bundles.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m in that way myself, and I like you for it.\u201d \u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Claypole, a little recovering.",
        "\u201cIn that way of business,\u201d rejoined Fagin; \u201cand so are the people of the house.",
        "You\u2019ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be.",
        "There is not a safer place in all this town than is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so.",
        "And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I\u2019ve said the word, and you may make your minds easy.\u201d Noah Claypole\u2019s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you more,\u201d said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements.",
        "\u201cI have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.\u201d \u201cYer speak as if yer were in earnest,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cWhat advantage would it be to me to be anything else?\u201d inquired Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.",
        "\u201cHere! Let me have a word with you outside.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,\u201d said Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019ll take the luggage upstairs the while.",
        "Charlotte, see to them bundles.\u201d This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s kept tolerably well under, ain\u2019t she?\u201d he asked as he resumed his seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.",
        "\u201cQuite perfect,\u201d rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a genius, my dear.\u201d \u201cWhy, I suppose if I wasn\u2019t, I shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cBut, I say, she\u2019ll be back if yer lose time.\u201d \u201cNow, what do you think?\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cIf you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?\u201d \u201cIs he in a good way of business; that\u2019s where it is!\u201d responded Noah, winking one of his little eyes.",
        "\u201cThe top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.\u201d \u201cRegular town maders?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cNot a countryman among \u2019em; and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take you, even on my recommendation, if he didn\u2019t run rather short of assistants just now,\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cShould I have to hand over?\u201d said Noah, slapping his breeches pocket.",
        "\u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be done without,\u201d replied Fagin, in a most decided manner.",
        "\u201cTwenty pound, though\u2014it\u2019s a lot of money!\u201d \u201cNot when it\u2019s in a note you can\u2019t get rid of,\u201d retorted Fagin.",
        "\u201cNumber and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It\u2019s not worth much to him.",
        "It\u2019ll have to go abroad, and he couldn\u2019t sell it for a great deal in the market.\u201d \u201cWhen could I see him?\u201d asked Noah doubtfully.",
        "\u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d \u201cUm!\u201d said Noah.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the wages?\u201d \u201cLive like a gentleman\u2014board and lodging, pipes and spirits free\u2014half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Fagin.",
        "Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him.",
        "\u201cBut, yer see,\u201d observed Noah, \u201cas she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.\u201d \u201cA little fancy work?\u201d suggested Fagin.",
        "\u201cAh! something of that sort,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cWhat do you think would suit me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know.",
        "That\u2019s the sort of thing!\u201d \u201cI heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cMy friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.\u201d \u201cWhy, I did mention that, and I shouldn\u2019t mind turning my hand to it sometimes,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Claypole slowly; \u201cbut it wouldn\u2019t pay by itself, you know.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.",
        "\u201cNo, it might not.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think, then?\u201d asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.",
        "\u201cSomething in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of the old ladies?\u201d asked Fagin.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?\u201d asked Noah, shaking his head.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think that would answer my purpose.",
        "Ain\u2019t there any other line open?\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s knee.",
        "\u201cThe kinchin lay.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d demanded Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cThe kinchins, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cis the young children that\u2019s sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away\u2014they\u2019ve always got it ready in their hands,\u2014then knock \u2019em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d roared Mr.",
        "Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.",
        "\u201cLord, that\u2019s the very thing!\u201d \u201cTo be sure it is,\u201d replied Fagin; \u201cand you can have a few good beats chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they\u2019re always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day.",
        "Ha! ha! ha!\u201d With this, Fagin poked Mr.",
        "Claypole in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud.",
        "\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right!\u201d said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and Charlotte had returned.",
        "\u201cWhat time tomorrow shall we say?\u201d \u201cWill ten do?\u201d asked Fagin, adding, as Mr.",
        "Claypole nodded assent, \u201cWhat name shall I tell my good friend.\u201d \u201cMr.",
        "Bolter,\u201d replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency.",
        "Morris Bolter.",

        "Bolter.\u201d \u201cMrs.",
        "Bolter\u2019s humble servant,\u201d said Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness.",
        "\u201cI hope I shall know her better very shortly.\u201d \u201cDo you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?\u201d thundered Mr.",
        "Claypole.",
        "\u201cYes, Noah, dear!\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Bolter, extending her hand.",
        "\u201cShe calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Morris Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.",
        "\u201cYou understand?\u201d \u201cOh yes, I understand\u2014perfectly,\u201d replied Fagin, telling the truth for once.",
        "\u201cGood night! Good night!\u201d With many adieus and good wishes, Mr.",
        "Fagin went his way.",
        "Noah Claypole, bespeaking his good lady\u2019s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.",
        "CHAPTER XLIII.",
        "WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE \u201cAnd so it was you that was your own friend, was it?\u201d asked Mr.",

        "\u201cCod, I thought as much last night!\u201d \u201cEvery man\u2019s his own friend, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, with his most insinuating grin.",
        "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t as good a one as himself anywhere.\u201d \u201cExcept sometimes,\u201d replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of the world.",
        "\u201cSome people are nobody\u2019s enemies but their own, yer know.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t believe that,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cWhen a man\u2019s his own enemy, it\u2019s only because he\u2019s too much his own friend; not because he\u2019s careful for everybody but himself.",

        "\u201cThat stands to reason.",
        "Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven.",
        "It\u2019s neither, my friend, neither.",
        "It\u2019s number one.\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Bolter.",
        "\u201cNumber one for ever.\u201d \u201cIn a little community like ours, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position, \u201cwe have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.\u201d \u201cOh, the devil!\u201d exclaimed Mr.",
        "Bolter.",
        "\u201cYou see,\u201d pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, \u201cwe are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so.",
        "For instance, it\u2019s your object to take care of number one\u2014meaning yourself.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bolter.",
        "\u201cYer about right there.\u201d \u201cWell! You can\u2019t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.\u201d \u201cNumber two, you mean,\u201d said Mr.",

        "You\u2019ve done what\u2019s a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that\u2019s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose\u2014in plain English, the halter!\u201d Mr.",
        "Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance.",
        "\u201cThe gallows,\u201d continued Fagin, \u201cthe gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow\u2019s career on the broad highway.",
        "To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.\u201d \u201cOf course it is,\u201d replied Mr.",

        "Bolter, thoughtfully.",
        "\u201cOh! yer a cunning old codger!\u201d Mr.",
        "Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.",
        "To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr.",
        "Bolter\u2019s respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,\u201d said Fagin.",

        "They remanded him till today, for they thought they knew the owner.",
        "Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I\u2019d give the price of as many to have him back.",
        "You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.\u201d \u201cWell, but I shall know him, I hope; don\u2019t yer think so?\u201d said Mr.",

        "\u201cIf they don\u2019t get any fresh evidence, it\u2019ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it\u2019s a case of lagging.",
        "They know what a clever lad he is; he\u2019ll be a lifer.",

        "Bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words, \u201ctransportation for life,\u201d when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi comical woe.",

        "Oh, why didn\u2019t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!\u201d With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency.",
        "\u201cWhat do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!\u201d exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil.",
        "\u201cWasn\u2019t he always the top sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent! Eh?\u201d \u201cNot one,\u201d replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; \u201cnot one.\u201d \u201cThen what do you talk of?\u201d replied Fagin angrily; \u201cwhat are you blubbering for?\u201d \u201c\u2019Cause it isn\u2019t on the rec ord, is it?\u201d said Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets; \u201c\u2019cause it can\u2019t come out in the \u2019dictment; \u2019cause nobody will never know half of what he was.",

        "Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; \u201csee what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.",
        "Ain\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Mr.",
        "Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.",
        "\u201cNever mind, Charley,\u201d said Fagin soothingly; \u201cit\u2019ll come out, it\u2019ll be sure to come out.",
        "They\u2019ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he\u2019ll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers.",
        "Think how young he is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!\u201d \u201cWell, it is a honour that is!\u201d said Charley, a little consoled.",
        "\u201cHe shall have all he wants,\u201d continued the Jew.",
        "\u201cHe shall be kept in the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman.",
        "Like a gentleman! With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can\u2019t spend it.\u201d \u201cNo, shall he though?\u201d cried Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cAy, that he shall,\u201d replied Fagin, \u201cand we\u2019ll have a big wig, Charley: one that\u2019s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we\u2019ll read it all in the papers\u2014\u2018Artful Dodger\u2014shrieks of laughter\u2014here the court was convulsed\u2019\u2014eh, Charley, eh?\u201d \u201cHa! ha!\u201d laughed Master Bates, \u201cwhat a lark that would be, wouldn\u2019t it, Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother \u2019em wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cWould!\u201d cried Fagin.",
        "\u201cHe shall\u2014he will!\u201d \u201cAh, to be sure, so he will,\u201d repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.",
        "\u201cI think I see him now,\u201d cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.",
        "\u201cSo do I,\u201d cried Charley Bates.",
        "\u201cHa! ha! ha! so do I.",
        "I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.",
        "What a game! What a regular game! All the big wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of \u2019em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge\u2019s own son making a speech arter dinner\u2014ha! ha! ha!\u201d In fact, Mr.",
        "Fagin had so well humoured his young friend\u2019s eccentric disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.",
        "\u201cWe must know how he gets on today, by some handy means or other,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cLet me think.\u201d \u201cShall I go?\u201d asked Charley.",
        "\u201cNot for the world,\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cAre you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you\u2019d walk into the very place where\u2014No, Charley, no.",
        "One is enough to lose at a time.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to go yourself, I suppose?\u201d said Charley with a humorous leer.",
        "\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t quite fit,\u201d replied Fagin shaking his head.",
        "\u201cThen why don\u2019t you send this new cove?\u201d asked Master Bates, laying his hand on Noah\u2019s arm.",
        "\u201cNobody knows him.\u201d \u201cWhy, if he didn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d observed Fagin.",
        "\u201cMind!\u201d interposed Charley.",
        "\u201cWhat should he have to mind?\u201d \u201cReally nothing, my dear,\u201d said Fagin, turning to Mr.",
        "Bolter, \u201creally nothing.\u201d \u201cOh, I dare say about that, yer know,\u201d observed Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.",
        "\u201cNo, no\u2014none of that.",
        "It\u2019s not in my department, that ain\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWot department has he got, Fagin?\u201d inquired Master Bates, surveying Noah\u2019s lank form with much disgust.",
        "\u201cThe cutting away when there\u2019s anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there\u2019s everything right; is that his branch?\u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d retorted Mr.",
        "Bolter; \u201cand don\u2019t yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer\u2019ll find yerself in the wrong shop.\u201d Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr.",
        "Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.",
        "Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr.",
        "Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition.",
        "By Fagin\u2019s directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner\u2019s frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand.",
        "He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter\u2019s whip.",
        "Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw boned a fellow as need be, Mr.",
        "Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection.",
        "These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow Street.",
        "Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.",
        "Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which\u2014Master Bates being pretty well acquainted with the locality\u2014were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.",
        "He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice.",
        "There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table.",
        "A jailer stood reclining against the dock rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman \u201cTake that baby out,\u201d when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half smothered in the mother\u2019s shawl, from some meagre infant.",
        "The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt discoloured; and the ceiling blackened.",
        "There was an old smoky bust over the mantel shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock\u2014the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.",
        "Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character\u2019s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of Mr.",
        "Dawkins was to be seen.",
        "He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit.",
        "It was indeed Mr.",
        "Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that \u2019ere disgraceful sitivation for.",
        "\u201cHold your tongue, will you?\u201d said the jailer.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m an Englishman, ain\u2019t I?\u201d rejoined the Dodger.",
        "\u201cWhere are my priwileges?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll get your privileges soon enough,\u201d retorted the jailer, \u201cand pepper with \u2019em.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say to the beaks, if I don\u2019t,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Dawkins.",
        "\u201cNow then! Wot is this here business? I shall thank the madg\u2019strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I\u2019ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he\u2019ll go away if I ain\u2019t there to my time, and then pr\u2019aps ther won\u2019t be an action for damage against them as kep me away.",
        "Oh no, certainly not!\u201d At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate \u201cthe names of them two files as was on the bench.\u201d Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.",
        "\u201cSilence there!\u201d cried the jailer.",
        "\u201cWhat is this?\u201d inquired one of the magistrates.",
        "\u201cA pick pocketing case, your worship.\u201d \u201cHas the boy ever been here before?\u201d \u201cHe ought to have been, a many times,\u201d replied the jailer.",
        "\u201cHe has been pretty well everywhere else.",
        "_I_ know him well, your worship.\u201d \u201cOh! you know me, do you?\u201d cried the Artful, making a note of the statement.",
        "\u201cWery good.",
        "That\u2019s a case of deformation of character, any way.\u201d Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.",
        "\u201cNow then, where are the witnesses?\u201d said the clerk.",
        "\u201cAh! that\u2019s right,\u201d added the Dodger.",
        "\u201cWhere are they? I should like to see \u2019em.\u201d This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance.",
        "For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff box, with the owner\u2019s name engraved upon the lid.",
        "This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.",
        "He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.",
        "\u201cHave you anything to ask this witness, boy?\u201d said the magistrate.",
        "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,\u201d replied the Dodger.",
        "\u201cHave you anything to say at all?\u201d \u201cDo you hear his worship ask if you\u2019ve anything to say?\u201d inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.",
        "\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said the Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction.",
        "\u201cDid you redress yourself to me, my man?\u201d \u201cI never see such an out and out young wagabond, your worship,\u201d observed the officer with a grin.",
        "\u201cDo you mean to say anything, you young shaver?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the Dodger, \u201cnot here, for this ain\u2019t the shop for justice: besides which, my attorney is a breakfasting this morning with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and \u2019spectable circle of acquaintance as\u2019ll make them beaks wish they\u2019d never been born, or that they\u2019d got their footmen to hang \u2019em up to their own hat pegs, afore they let \u2019em come out this morning to try it on upon me.",
        "I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d \u201cThere! He\u2019s fully committed!\u201d interposed the clerk.",
        "\u201cTake him away.\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d said the jailer.",
        "\u201cOh ah! I\u2019ll come on,\u201d replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand.",
        "\u201cAh! (to the Bench) it\u2019s no use your looking frightened; I won\u2019t show you no mercy, not a ha\u2019porth of it.",
        "_You\u2019ll_ pay for this, my fine fellers.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t be you for something! I wouldn\u2019t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me.",
        "Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!\u201d With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer\u2019s face, with great glee and self approval.",
        "Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates.",
        "After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person.",
        "The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr.",
        "Fagin the animating news that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation.",
        "CHAPTER XLIV.",
        "THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE.",
        "SHE FAILS.",
        "Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind.",
        "She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.",
        "Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last\u2014richly as he merited such a fate\u2014by her hand.",
        "But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration.",
        "Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her\u2014and what more could she do! She was resolved.",
        "Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too.",
        "She grew pale and thin, even within a few days.",
        "At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest.",
        "At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards\u2014she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.",
        "It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour.",
        "Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.",
        "The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too.",
        "Eleven.",
        "\u201cAn hour this side of midnight,\u201d said Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat.",
        "\u201cDark and heavy it is too.",
        "A good night for business this.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cWhat a pity, Bill, my dear, that there\u2019s none quite ready to be done.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re right for once,\u201d replied Sikes gruffly.",
        "\u201cIt is a pity, for I\u2019m in the humour too.\u201d Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.",
        "\u201cWe must make up for lost time when we\u2019ve got things into a good train.",
        "That\u2019s all I know,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the way to talk, my dear,\u201d replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder.",
        "\u201cIt does me good to hear you.\u201d \u201cDoes you good, does it!\u201d cried Sikes.",
        "\u201cWell, so be it.\u201d \u201cHa! ha! ha!\u201d laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re like yourself tonight, Bill.",
        "Quite like yourself.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,\u201d said Sikes, casting off the Jew\u2019s hand.",
        "\u201cIt make you nervous, Bill,\u2014reminds you of being nabbed, does it?\u201d said Fagin, determined not to be offended.",
        "\u201cReminds me of being nabbed by the devil,\u201d returned Sikes.",
        "\u201cThere never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old \u2019un without any father at all betwixt you; which I shouldn\u2019t wonder at, a bit.\u201d Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room.",
        "\u201cHallo!\u201d cried Sikes.",
        "\u201cNance.",
        "Where\u2019s the gal going to at this time of night?\u201d \u201cNot far.\u201d \u201cWhat answer\u2019s that?\u201d retorted Sikes.",
        "\u201cDo you hear me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know where,\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cThen I do,\u201d said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.",
        "\u201cNowhere.",
        "Sit down.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not well.",
        "I told you that before,\u201d rejoined the girl.",
        "\u201cI want a breath of air.\u201d \u201cPut your head out of the winder,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough there,\u201d said the girl.",
        "\u201cI want it in the street.\u201d \u201cThen you won\u2019t have it,\u201d replied Sikes.",
        "With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press.",
        "\u201cThere,\u201d said the robber.",
        "\u201cNow stop quietly where you are, will you?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,\u201d said the girl turning very pale.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d \u201cKnow what I\u2019m\u2014Oh!\u201d cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, \u201cshe\u2019s out of her senses, you know, or she daren\u2019t talk to me in that way.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll drive me on the something desperate,\u201d muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak.",
        "\u201cLet me go, will you,\u2014this minute\u2014this instant.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cTell him to let me go, Fagin.",
        "He had better.",
        "It\u2019ll be better for him.",
        "Do you hear me?\u201d cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.",
        "\u201cHear you!\u201d repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.",
        "\u201cAye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as\u2019ll tear some of that screaming voice out.",
        "Wot has come over you, you jade! Wot is it?\u201d \u201cLet me go,\u201d said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said, \u201cBill, let me go; you don\u2019t know what you are doing.",
        "You don\u2019t, indeed.",
        "For only one hour\u2014do\u2014do!\u201d \u201cCut my limbs off one by one!\u201d cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm, \u201cIf I don\u2019t think the gal\u2019s stark raving mad.",
        "Get up.\u201d \u201cNot till you let me go\u2014not till you let me go\u2014Never\u2014never!\u201d screamed the girl.",
        "Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force.",
        "She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o\u2019clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.",
        "With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined Fagin.",
        "\u201cWhew!\u201d said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.",
        "\u201cWot a precious strange gal that is!\u201d \u201cYou may say that, Bill,\u201d replied Fagin thoughtfully.",
        "\u201cYou may say that.\u201d \u201cWot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for, do you think?\u201d asked Sikes.",
        "\u201cCome; you should know her better than me.",
        "Wot does it mean?\u201d \u201cObstinacy; woman\u2019s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.\u201d \u201cWell, I suppose it is,\u201d growled Sikes.",
        "\u201cI thought I had tamed her, but she\u2019s as bad as ever.\u201d \u201cWorse,\u201d said Fagin thoughtfully.",
        "\u201cI never knew her like this, for such a little cause.\u201d \u201cNor I,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cI think she\u2019s got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it won\u2019t come out\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cLike enough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she\u2019s took that way again,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.",
        "\u201cShe was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cWe was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it\u2019s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless\u2014eh?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it, my dear,\u201d replied the Jew in a whisper.",
        "\u201cHush!\u201d As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat.",
        "Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.",
        "\u201cWhy, now she\u2019s on the other tack!\u201d exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion.",
        "Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour.",
        "Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade him good night.",
        "He paused when he reached the room door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.",
        "\u201cLight him down,\u201d said Sikes, who was filling his pipe.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight seers.",
        "Show him a light.\u201d Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.",
        "When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.",
        "\u201cWhat is it, Nancy, dear?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d replied the girl, in the same tone.",
        "\u201cThe reason of all this,\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cIf _he_\u201d\u2014he pointed with his skinny fore finger up the stairs\u2014\u201cis so hard with you (he\u2019s a brute, Nance, a brute beast), why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.",
        "\u201cNo matter just now.",
        "We\u2019ll talk of this again.",
        "You have a friend in me, Nance; a staunch friend.",
        "I have the means at hand, quiet and close.",
        "If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog\u2014like a dog! worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes\u2014come to me.",
        "I say, come to me.",
        "He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.\u201d \u201cI know you well,\u201d replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion.",
        "\u201cGood night.\u201d She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.",
        "Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain.",
        "He had conceived the idea\u2014not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees\u2014that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker\u2019s brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend.",
        "Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty.",
        "The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons.",
        "He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured without delay.",
        "There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.",
        "Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden.",
        "The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked\u2014to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life\u2014on the object of her more recent fancy.",
        "\u201cWith a little persuasion,\u201d thought Fagin, \u201cwhat more likely than that she would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now.",
        "There would be the dangerous villain: the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.\u201d These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker\u2019s room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.",
        "There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning.",
        "The girl clearly comprehended it.",
        "Her glance at parting showed _that_.",
        "But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained.",
        "\u201cHow,\u201d thought Fagin, as he crept homeward, \u201ccan I increase my influence with her? What new power can I acquire?\u201d Such brains are fertile in expedients.",
        "If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance? \u201cI can,\u201d said Fagin, almost aloud.",
        "\u201cShe durst not refuse me then.",
        "Not for her life, not for her life! I have it all.",
        "The means are ready, and shall be set to work.",
        "I shall have you yet!\u201d He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers.",
        "CHAPTER XLV.",
        "NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast.",
        "\u201cBolter,\u201d said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite Morris Bolter.",
        "\u201cWell, here I am,\u201d returned Noah.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating.",
        "That\u2019s a great fault in this place.",
        "Yer never get time enough over yer meals.\u201d \u201cYou can talk as you eat, can\u2019t you?\u201d said Fagin, cursing his dear young friend\u2019s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.",
        "\u201cOh yes, I can talk.",
        "I get on better when I talk,\u201d said Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread.",
        "\u201cWhere\u2019s Charlotte?\u201d \u201cOut,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cI sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Noah.",
        "\u201cI wish yer\u2019d ordered her to make some buttered toast first.",
        "Well.",
        "Talk away.",
        "Yer won\u2019t interrupt me.\u201d There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business.",
        "\u201cYou did well yesterday, my dear,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cBeautiful! Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you forget to add three pint pots and a milk can,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bolter.",
        "\u201cNo, no, my dear.",
        "The pint pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece.\u201d \u201cPretty well, I think, for a beginner,\u201d remarked Mr.",
        "Bolter complacently.",
        "\u201cThe pots I took off airy railings, and the milk can was standing by itself outside a public house.",
        "I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know.",
        "Eh? Ha! ha! ha!\u201d Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr.",
        "Bolter having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.",
        "\u201cI want you, Bolter,\u201d said Fagin, leaning over the table, \u201cto do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.\u201d \u201cI say,\u201d rejoined Bolter, \u201cdon\u2019t yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o\u2019 yer police offices.",
        "That don\u2019t suit me, that don\u2019t; and so I tell yer.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the smallest danger in it\u2014not the very smallest,\u201d said the Jew; \u201cit\u2019s only to dodge a woman.\u201d \u201cAn old woman?\u201d demanded Mr.",
        "Bolter.",
        "\u201cA young one,\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cI can do that pretty well, I know,\u201d said Bolter.",
        "\u201cI was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school.",
        "What am I to dodge her for? Not to\u2014\u201d \u201cNot to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019ll yer give me?\u201d asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face.",
        "\u201cIf you do it well, a pound, my dear.",
        "One pound,\u201d said Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible.",
        "\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn\u2019t valuable consideration to be gained.\u201d \u201cWho is she?\u201d inquired Noah.",
        "\u201cOne of us.\u201d \u201cOh Lor!\u201d cried Noah, curling up his nose.",
        "\u201cYer doubtful of her, are yer?\u201d \u201cShe has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cI see,\u201d said Noah.",
        "\u201cJust to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they\u2019re respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I\u2019m your man.\u201d \u201cI knew you would be,\u201d cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal.",
        "\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cWhere is she? Where am I to wait for her? Where am I to go?\u201d \u201cAll that, my dear, you shall hear from me.",
        "I\u2019ll point her out at the proper time,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cYou keep ready, and leave the rest to me.\u201d That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter\u2019s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin.",
        "Six nights passed\u2014six long weary nights\u2014and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time.",
        "On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal.",
        "It was Sunday.",
        "\u201cShe goes abroad tonight,\u201d said Fagin, \u201cand on the right errand, I\u2019m sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak.",
        "Come with me.",
        "Quick!\u201d Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him.",
        "They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.",
        "It was past eleven o\u2019clock, and the door was closed.",
        "It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle.",
        "They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them.",
        "Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.",
        "\u201cIs that the woman?\u201d he asked, scarcely above his breath.",
        "Fagin nodded yes.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t see her face well,\u201d whispered Noah.",
        "\u201cShe is looking down, and the candle is behind her.\u201d \u201cStay there,\u201d whispered Fagin.",
        "He signed to Barney, who withdrew.",
        "In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face.",
        "\u201cI see her now,\u201d cried the spy.",
        "\u201cPlainly?\u201d \u201cI should know her among a thousand.\u201d He hastily descended, as the room door opened, and the girl came out.",
        "Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.",
        "\u201cHist!\u201d cried the lad who held the door.",
        "\u201cDow.\u201d Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.",
        "\u201cTo the left,\u201d whispered the lad; \u201ctake the left had, and keep od the other side.\u201d He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl\u2019s retreating figure, already at some distance before him.",
        "He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions.",
        "She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on.",
        "She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step.",
        "The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.",
        "CHAPTER XLVI.",
        "THE APPOINTMENT KEPT The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on London Bridge.",
        "One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.",
        "Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot passengers, turned back.",
        "The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement.",
        "When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again.",
        "At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped.",
        "The man stopped too.",
        "It was a very dark night.",
        "The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring.",
        "Such as there were, hurried quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view.",
        "Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of London\u2019s destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.",
        "A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.",
        "The old smoke stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes.",
        "The tower of old Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.",
        "The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro\u2014closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer\u2014when the heavy bell of St.",
        "Paul\u2019s tolled for the death of another day.",
        "Midnight had come upon the crowded city.",
        "The palace, the night cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.",
        "The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it.",
        "They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.",
        "They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.",
        "They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up\u2014brushed against them, indeed\u2014at that precise moment.",
        "\u201cNot here,\u201d said Nancy hurriedly, \u201cI am afraid to speak to you here.",
        "Come away\u2014out of the public road\u2014down the steps yonder!\u201d As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.",
        "The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour\u2019s Church, form a landing stairs from the river.",
        "To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment\u2019s survey of the place, he began to descend.",
        "These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.",
        "Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.",
        "At this point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step.",
        "The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.",
        "So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation.",
        "He was on the point of emerging from his hiding place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.",
        "He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively.",
        "\u201cThis is far enough,\u201d said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman.",
        "\u201cI will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.",
        "Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.\u201d \u201cTo humour me!\u201d cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re considerate, indeed, sir.",
        "To humour me! Well, well, it\u2019s no matter.\u201d \u201cWhy, for what,\u201d said the gentleman in a kinder tone, \u201cfor what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?\u201d \u201cI told you before,\u201d replied Nancy, \u201cthat I was afraid to speak to you there.",
        "I don\u2019t know why it is,\u201d said the girl, shuddering, \u201cbut I have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that I can hardly stand.\u201d \u201cA fear of what?\u201d asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.",
        "\u201cI scarcely know of what,\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cI wish I did.",
        "Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.",
        "I was reading a book tonight, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.\u201d \u201cImagination,\u201d said the gentleman, soothing her.",
        "\u201cNo imagination,\u201d replied the girl in a hoarse voice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll swear I saw \u2018coffin\u2019 written in every page of the book in large black letters,\u2014aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets tonight.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing unusual in that,\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cThey have passed me often.\u201d \u201c_Real ones_,\u201d rejoined the girl.",
        "\u201cThis was not.\u201d There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him.",
        "He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.",
        "\u201cSpeak to her kindly,\u201d said the young lady to her companion.",
        "\u201cPoor creature! She seems to need it.\u201d \u201cYour haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am tonight, and preached of flames and vengeance,\u201d cried the girl.",
        "\u201cOh, dear lady, why ar\u2019n\u2019t those who claim to be God\u2019s own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cA Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.",
        "Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!\u201d These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself.",
        "The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.",
        "\u201cYou were not here last Sunday night,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cI couldn\u2019t come,\u201d replied Nancy; \u201cI was kept by force.\u201d \u201cBy whom?\u201d \u201cHim that I told the young lady of before.\u201d \u201cYou were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight, I hope?\u201d asked the old gentleman.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied the girl, shaking her head.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn\u2019t give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.\u201d \u201cDid he awake before you returned?\u201d inquired the gentleman.",
        "\u201cNo; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cNow listen to me.\u201d \u201cI am ready,\u201d replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.",
        "\u201cThis young lady,\u201d the gentleman began, \u201chas communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since.",
        "I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d said the girl earnestly.",
        "\u201cI repeat that I firmly believe it.",
        "To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.",
        "But if\u2014if\u2014\u201d said the gentleman, \u201che cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.\u201d \u201cFagin,\u201d cried the girl, recoiling.",
        "\u201cThat man must be delivered up by you,\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cI will not do it! I will never do it!\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cDevil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.\u201d \u201cYou will not?\u201d said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer.",
        "\u201cNever!\u201d returned the girl.",
        "\u201cTell me why?\u201d \u201cFor one reason,\u201d rejoined the girl firmly, \u201cfor one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise: and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I\u2019ll not turn upon them, who might\u2014any of them\u2014have turned upon me, but didn\u2019t, bad as they are.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain; \u201cput Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.\u201d \u201cWhat if he turns against the others?\u201d \u201cI promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver\u2019s little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.\u201d \u201cAnd if it is not?\u201d suggested the girl.",
        "\u201cThen,\u201d pursued the gentleman, \u201cthis Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent.",
        "In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.\u201d \u201cHave I the lady\u2019s promise for that?\u201d asked the girl.",
        "\u201cYou have,\u201d replied Rose.",
        "\u201cMy true and faithful pledge.\u201d \u201cMonks would never learn how you knew what you do?\u201d said the girl, after a short pause.",
        "\u201cNever,\u201d replied the gentleman.",
        "\u201cThe intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.\u201d \u201cI have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,\u201d said the girl after another interval of silence, \u201cbut I will take your words.\u201d After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public house whence she had been followed that night.",
        "From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated.",
        "When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection.",
        "\u201cHe is tall,\u201d said the girl, \u201cand a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other.",
        "Don\u2019t forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man\u2019s, that you might almost tell him by that alone.",
        "His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he can\u2019t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard.",
        "His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds\u2014why did you start?\u201d said the girl, stopping suddenly.",
        "The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed.",
        "\u201cPart of this,\u201d said the girl, \u201cI have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak.",
        "I think that\u2019s all I can give you to know him by.",
        "Stay though,\u201d she added.",
        "\u201cUpon his throat: so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is\u2014\u201d \u201cA broad red mark, like a burn or scald?\u201d cried the gentleman.",
        "\u201cHow\u2019s this?\u201d said the girl.",
        "\u201cYou know him!\u201d The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.",
        "\u201cI think I do,\u201d said the gentleman, breaking silence.",
        "\u201cI should by your description.",
        "We shall see.",
        "Many people are singularly like each other.",
        "It may not be the same.\u201d As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, \u201cIt must be he!\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he had stood before, \u201cyou have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it.",
        "What can I do to serve you?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Nancy.",
        "\u201cYou will not persist in saying that,\u201d rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart.",
        "\u201cThink now.",
        "Tell me.\u201d \u201cNothing, sir,\u201d rejoined the girl, weeping.",
        "\u201cYou can do nothing to help me.",
        "I am past all hope, indeed.\u201d \u201cYou put yourself beyond its pale,\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cThe past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope.",
        "I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you.",
        "Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.",
        "Come! I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you.",
        "Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!\u201d \u201cShe will be persuaded now,\u201d cried the young lady.",
        "\u201cShe hesitates, I am sure.\u201d \u201cI fear not, my dear,\u201d said the gentleman.",
        "\u201cNo sir, I do not,\u201d replied the girl, after a short struggle.",
        "\u201cI am chained to my old life.",
        "I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it.",
        "I must have gone too far to turn back,\u2014and yet I don\u2019t know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.",
        "But,\u201d she said, looking hastily round, \u201cthis fear comes over me again.",
        "I must go home.\u201d \u201cHome!\u201d repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.",
        "\u201cHome, lady,\u201d rejoined the girl.",
        "\u201cTo such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life.",
        "Let us part.",
        "I shall be watched or seen.",
        "Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.\u201d \u201cIt is useless,\u201d said the gentleman, with a sigh.",
        "\u201cWe compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here.",
        "We may have detained her longer than she expected already.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d urged the girl.",
        "\u201cYou have.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d cried the young lady, \u201ccan be the end of this poor creature\u2019s life!\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d repeated the girl.",
        "\u201cLook before you, lady.",
        "Look at that dark water.",
        "How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.",
        "It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.\u201d \u201cDo not speak thus, pray,\u201d returned the young lady, sobbing.",
        "\u201cIt will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors should!\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cGood night, good night!\u201d The gentleman turned away.",
        "\u201cThis purse,\u201d cried the young lady.",
        "\u201cTake it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d replied the girl.",
        "\u201cI have not done this for money.",
        "Let me have that to think of.",
        "And yet\u2014give me something that you have worn: I should like to have something\u2014no, no, not a ring\u2014your gloves or handkerchief\u2014anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady.",
        "There.",
        "Bless you! God bless you.",
        "Good night, good night!\u201d The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.",
        "The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.",
        "The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge.",
        "They stopped at the summit of the stairs.",
        "\u201cHark!\u201d cried the young lady, listening.",
        "\u201cDid she call! I thought I heard her voice.\u201d \u201cNo, my love,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, looking sadly back.",
        "\u201cShe has not moved, and will not till we are gone.\u201d Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away.",
        "As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.",
        "After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street.",
        "The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.",
        "Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the Jew\u2019s house as fast as his legs would carry him.",
        "CHAPTER XLVII.",
        "FATAL CONSEQUENCES It was nearly two hours before day break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.",
        "He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side.",
        "His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he bit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog\u2019s or rat\u2019s.",
        "Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.",
        "Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.",
        "Indeed they were.",
        "Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.",
        "He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street.",
        "\u201cAt last,\u201d he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth.",
        "\u201cAt last!\u201d The bell rang gently as he spoke.",
        "He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm.",
        "Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.",
        "\u201cThere!\u201d he said, laying the bundle on the table.",
        "\u201cTake care of that, and do the most you can with it.",
        "It\u2019s been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.\u201d Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking.",
        "But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.",
        "\u201cWot now?\u201d cried Sikes.",
        "\u201cWot do you look at a man so for?\u201d Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.",
        "\u201cDamme!\u201d said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s gone mad.",
        "I must look to myself here.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014you\u2019re not the person, Bill.",
        "I\u2019ve no\u2014no fault to find with you.\u201d \u201cOh, you haven\u2019t, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s lucky\u2014for one of us.",
        "Which one that is, don\u2019t matter.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got that to tell you, Bill,\u201d said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer, \u201cwill make you worse than me.\u201d \u201cAye?\u201d returned the robber with an incredulous air.",
        "\u201cTell away! Look sharp, or Nance will think I\u2019m lost.\u201d \u201cLost!\u201d cried Fagin.",
        "\u201cShe has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.\u201d Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew\u2019s face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.",
        "\u201cSpeak, will you!\u201d he said; \u201cor if you don\u2019t, it shall be for want of breath.",
        "Open your mouth and say wot you\u2019ve got to say in plain words.",
        "Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!\u201d \u201cSuppose that lad that\u2019s laying there\u2014\u201d Fagin began.",
        "Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d he said, resuming his former position.",
        "\u201cSuppose that lad,\u201d pursued Fagin, \u201cwas to peach\u2014to blow upon us all\u2014first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with \u2019em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken.",
        "Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plan we\u2019ve all been in, more or less\u2014of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,\u2014but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them.",
        "Do you hear me?\u201d cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage.",
        "\u201cSuppose he did all this, what then?\u201d \u201cWhat then!\u201d replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.",
        "\u201cIf he was left alive till I came, I\u2019d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.\u201d \u201cWhat if I did it!\u201d cried Fagin almost in a yell.",
        "\u201cI, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d do something in the jail that \u2019ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I\u2019d fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people.",
        "I should have such strength,\u201d muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, \u201cthat I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.\u201d \u201cYou would?\u201d \u201cWould I!\u201d said the housebreaker.",
        "\u201cTry me.\u201d \u201cIf it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care who,\u201d replied Sikes impatiently.",
        "\u201cWhoever it was, I\u2019d serve them the same.\u201d Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him.",
        "Sikes leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in.",
        "\u201cBolter, Bolter! Poor lad!\u201d said Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s tired\u2014tired with watching for her so long,\u2014watching for _her_, Bill.\u201d \u201cWot d\u2019ye mean?\u201d asked Sikes, drawing back.",
        "Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture.",
        "When his assumed name had been repeated several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him.",
        "\u201cTell me that again\u2014once again, just for him to hear,\u201d said the Jew, pointing to Sikes as he spoke.",
        "\u201cTell yer what?\u201d asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.",
        "\u201cThat about\u2014 _Nancy_,\u201d said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.",
        "\u201cYou followed her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cTo London Bridge?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere she met two people.\u201d \u201cSo she did.\u201d \u201cA gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did\u2014and to describe him, which she did\u2014and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did\u2014and where it could be best watched from, which she did\u2014and what time the people went there, which she did.",
        "She did all this.",
        "She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur\u2014she did\u2014did she not?\u201d cried Fagin, half mad with fury.",
        "\u201cAll right,\u201d replied Noah, scratching his head.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s just what it was!\u201d \u201cWhat did they say, about last Sunday?\u201d \u201cAbout last Sunday!\u201d replied Noah, considering.",
        "\u201cWhy I told yer that before.\u201d \u201cAgain.",
        "Tell it again!\u201d cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.",
        "\u201cThey asked her,\u201d said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was, \u201cthey asked her why she didn\u2019t come, last Sunday, as she promised.",
        "She said she couldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014why? Tell him that.\u201d \u201cBecause she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them of before,\u201d replied Noah.",
        "\u201cWhat more of him?\u201d cried Fagin.",
        "\u201cWhat more of the man she had told them of before? Tell him that, tell him that.\u201d \u201cWhy, that she couldn\u2019t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,\u201d said Noah; \u201cand so the first time she went to see the lady, she\u2014ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did\u2014she gave him a drink of laudanum.\u201d \u201cHell\u2019s fire!\u201d cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.",
        "\u201cLet me go!\u201d Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs.",
        "\u201cBill, Bill!\u201d cried Fagin, following him hastily.",
        "\u201cA word.",
        "Only a word.\u201d The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the Jew came panting up.",
        "\u201cLet me out,\u201d said Sikes.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me; it\u2019s not safe.",
        "Let me out, I say!\u201d \u201cHear me speak a word,\u201d rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.",
        "\u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d replied the other.",
        "\u201cYou won\u2019t be\u2014too\u2014violent, Bill?\u201d The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other\u2019s faces.",
        "They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.",
        "\u201cI mean,\u201d said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless, \u201cnot too violent for safety.",
        "Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.\u201d Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.",
        "Without one pause, or moment\u2019s consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door.",
        "He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.",
        "The girl was lying, half dressed, upon it.",
        "He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.",
        "\u201cGet up!\u201d said the man.",
        "\u201cIt is you, Bill!\u201d said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return.",
        "\u201cIt is,\u201d was the reply.",
        "\u201cGet up.\u201d There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.",
        "Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.",
        "\u201cLet it be,\u201d said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s enough light for wot I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d \u201cBill,\u201d said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, \u201cwhy do you look like that at me!\u201d The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.",
        "\u201cBill, Bill!\u201d gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,\u2014\u201cI\u2014I won\u2019t scream or cry\u2014not once\u2014hear me\u2014speak to me\u2014tell me what I have done!\u201d \u201cYou know, you she devil!\u201d returned the robber, suppressing his breath.",
        "\u201cYou were watched tonight; every word you said was heard.\u201d \u201cThen spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,\u201d rejoined the girl, clinging to him.",
        "\u201cBill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to kill me.",
        "Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you.",
        "You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off.",
        "Bill, Bill, for dear God\u2019s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!\u201d The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away.",
        "\u201cBill,\u201d cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, \u201cthe gentleman and that dear lady, told me tonight of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.",
        "Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more.",
        "It is never too late to repent.",
        "They told me so\u2014I feel it now\u2014but we must have time\u2014a little, little time!\u201d The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol.",
        "The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.",
        "She staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief\u2014Rose Maylie\u2019s own\u2014and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker.",
        "It was a ghastly figure to look upon.",
        "The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down.",
        "CHAPTER XLVIII.",
        "THE FLIGHT OF SIKES Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide London\u2019s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst.",
        "Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.",
        "The sun\u2014the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man\u2014burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory.",
        "Through costly coloured glass and paper mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray.",
        "It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.",
        "It did.",
        "He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in.",
        "If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light! He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir.",
        "There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again.",
        "Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.",
        "He had plucked it off again.",
        "And there was the body\u2014mere flesh and blood, no more\u2014but such flesh, and so much blood! He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it.",
        "There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.",
        "Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.",
        "He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them.",
        "How those stains were dispersed about the room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.",
        "All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment.",
        "Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets.",
        "He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.",
        "He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside.",
        "There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again.",
        "It lay nearly under there.",
        "_He_ knew that.",
        "God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot! The glance was instantaneous.",
        "It was a relief to have got free of the room.",
        "He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.",
        "He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath.",
        "Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.",
        "Soon he was up again, and away,\u2014not far into the country, but back towards London by the high road\u2014then back again\u2014then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed\u2014then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches\u2019 brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.",
        "Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink? Hendon.",
        "That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people\u2019s way.",
        "Thither he directed his steps,\u2014running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\u2019s pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.",
        "But when he got there, all the people he met\u2014the very children at the doors\u2014seemed to view him with suspicion.",
        "Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go.",
        "He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place.",
        "Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot.",
        "At last he got away, and shaped his course for Hatfield.",
        "It was nine o\u2019clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot.",
        "There was a fire in the tap room, and some country labourers were drinking before it.",
        "They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time.",
        "The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young\u2014not older, one white haired grandfather said, than he was\u2014with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least\u2014if he had taken care; if he had taken care.",
        "There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this.",
        "The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer.",
        "This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back.",
        "His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement.",
        "\u201cAnd what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?\u201d asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition cakes in one corner.",
        "\u201cThis,\u201d said the fellow, producing one, \u201cthis is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff.",
        "Wine stains, fruit stains, beer stains, water stains, paint stains, pitch stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition.",
        "If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she\u2019s cured at once\u2014for it\u2019s poison.",
        "If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question\u2014for it\u2019s quite as satisfactory as a pistol bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it.",
        "One penny a square.",
        "With all these virtues, one penny a square!\u201d There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated.",
        "The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\u201d said the fellow.",
        "\u201cThere are fourteen water mills, six steam engines, and a galvanic battery, always a working upon it, and they can\u2019t make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins.",
        "One penny a square! Two half pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy.",
        "One penny a square! Wine stains, fruit stains, beer stains, water stains, paint stains, pitch stains, mud stains, blood stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I\u2019ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.\u201d \u201cHah!\u201d cried Sikes starting up.",
        "\u201cGive that back.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take it clean out, sir,\u201d replied the man, winking to the company, \u201cbefore you can come across the room to get it.",
        "Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman\u2019s hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half crown.",
        "Whether it is a wine stain, fruit stain, beer stain, water stain, paint stain, pitch stain, mud stain, or blood stain\u2014\u201d The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.",
        "With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the little post office.",
        "He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened.",
        "The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter bag.",
        "A man, dressed like a game keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s for your people,\u201d said the guard.",
        "\u201cNow, look alive in there, will you.",
        "Damn that \u2019ere bag, it warn\u2019t ready night afore last; this won\u2019t do, you know!\u201d \u201cAnything new up in town, Ben?\u201d asked the game keeper, drawing back to the window shutters, the better to admire the horses.",
        "\u201cNo, nothing that I knows on,\u201d replied the man, pulling on his gloves.",
        "\u201cCorn\u2019s up a little.",
        "I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way, but I don\u2019t reckon much upon it.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s quite true,\u201d said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window.",
        "\u201cAnd a dreadful murder it was.\u201d \u201cWas it, sir?\u201d rejoined the guard, touching his hat.",
        "\u201cMan or woman, pray, sir?\u201d \u201cA woman,\u201d replied the gentleman.",
        "\u201cIt is supposed\u2014\u201d \u201cNow, Ben,\u201d replied the coachman impatiently.",
        "\u201cDamn that \u2019ere bag,\u201d said the guard; \u201care you gone to sleep in there?\u201d \u201cComing!\u201d cried the office keeper, running out.",
        "\u201cComing,\u201d growled the guard.",
        "\u201cAh, and so\u2019s the young \u2019ooman of property that\u2019s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\u2019t know when.",
        "Here, give hold.",
        "All ri\u2014ight!\u201d The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.",
        "Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.",
        "At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield to St.",
        "Albans.",
        "He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core.",
        "Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning\u2019s ghastly figure following at his heels.",
        "He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.",
        "He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry.",
        "If he stopped it did the same.",
        "If he ran, it followed\u2014not running too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.",
        "At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then.",
        "He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now\u2014always.",
        "He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night sky.",
        "He threw himself upon the road\u2014on his back upon the road.",
        "At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still\u2014a living grave stone, with its epitaph in blood.",
        "Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence must sleep.",
        "There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear.",
        "There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night.",
        "Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.",
        "He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall\u2014to undergo new torture.",
        "For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped.",
        "Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing.",
        "There were but two, but they were everywhere.",
        "If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well known object\u2014some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory\u2014each in its accustomed place.",
        "The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.",
        "He got up, and rushed into the field without.",
        "The figure was behind him.",
        "He re entered the shed, and shrunk down once more.",
        "The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.",
        "And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.",
        "Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him.",
        "He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air.",
        "The broad sky seemed on fire.",
        "Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood.",
        "The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food.",
        "The noise increased as he looked.",
        "There were people there\u2014men and women\u2014light, bustle.",
        "It was like new life to him.",
        "He darted onward\u2014straight, headlong\u2014dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him.",
        "He came upon the spot.",
        "There were half dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red hot beams.",
        "The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground.",
        "Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.",
        "The clanking of the engine pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.",
        "He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng.",
        "Hither and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest.",
        "Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained.",
        "This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime.",
        "He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk.",
        "The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together.",
        "He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment.",
        "He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the murder.",
        "\u201cHe has gone to Birmingham, they say,\u201d said one: \u201cbut they\u2019ll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by tomorrow night there\u2019ll be a cry all through the country.\u201d He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.",
        "He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.",
        "Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\u201d he thought.",
        "\u201cA good hiding place, too.",
        "They\u2019ll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent.",
        "Why can\u2019t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I\u2019ll risk it.\u201d He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.",
        "The dog, though.",
        "If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him.",
        "This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets.",
        "He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.",
        "The animal looked up into his master\u2019s face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber\u2019s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along.",
        "When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.",
        "\u201cDo you hear me call? Come here!\u201d cried Sikes.",
        "The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back.",
        "\u201cCome back!\u201d said the robber.",
        "The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.",
        "Sikes made a running noose and called him again.",
        "The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed.",
        "The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return.",
        "But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey.",
        "CHAPTER XLIX.",
        "MONKS AND MR.",
        "BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET.",
        "THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr.",
        "Brownlow alighted from a hackney coach at his own door, and knocked softly.",
        "The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.",
        "At a sign from Mr.",
        "Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house.",
        "This man was Monks.",
        "They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.",
        "Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back room.",
        "At the door of this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped.",
        "The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions.",
        "\u201cHe knows the alternative,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Browlow.",
        "\u201cIf he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.\u201d \u201cHow dare you say this of me?\u201d asked Monks.",
        "\u201cHow dare you urge me to it, young man?\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, confronting him with a steady look.",
        "\u201cAre you mad enough to leave this house? Unhand him.",
        "There, sir.",
        "You are free to go, and we to follow.",
        "But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.",
        "I am resolute and immoveable.",
        "If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!\u201d \u201cBy what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?\u201d asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him.",
        "\u201cBy mine,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cThose persons are indemnified by me.",
        "If you complain of being deprived of your liberty\u2014you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet\u2014I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law.",
        "I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.\u201d Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.",
        "He hesitated.",
        "\u201cYou will decide quickly,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, with perfect firmness and composure.",
        "\u201cIf you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way.",
        "If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.",
        "It has waited for you two whole days.\u201d Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.",
        "\u201cYou will be prompt,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cA word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.\u201d Still the man hesitated.",
        "\u201cI have not the inclination to parley,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cand, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.\u201d \u201cIs there\u2014\u201d demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,\u2014\u201cis there\u2014no middle course?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.",
        "\u201cLock the door on the outside,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow to the attendants, \u201cand come when I ring.\u201d The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.",
        "\u201cThis is pretty treatment, sir,\u201d said Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak, \u201cfrom my father\u2019s oldest friend.\u201d \u201cIt is because I was your father\u2019s oldest friend, young man,\u201d returned Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cit is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters\u2019s death bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would\u2014but Heaven willed otherwise\u2014have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now\u2014yes, Edward Leeford, even now\u2014and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.\u201d \u201cWhat has the name to do with it?\u201d asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion.",
        "\u201cWhat is the name to me?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cnothing to you.",
        "But it was _hers_, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger.",
        "I am very glad you have changed it\u2014very\u2014very.\u201d \u201cThis is all mighty fine,\u201d said Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr.",
        "Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his hand.",
        "\u201cBut what do you want with me?\u201d \u201cYou have a brother,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, rousing himself: \u201ca brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.\u201d \u201cI have no brother,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cYou know I was an only child.",
        "Why do you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.\u201d \u201cAttend to what I do know, and you may not,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cI shall interest you by and by.",
        "I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care for hard names,\u201d interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.",
        "\u201cYou know the fact, and that\u2019s enough for me.\u201d \u201cBut I also know,\u201d pursued the old gentleman, \u201cthe misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill assorted union.",
        "I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.",
        "I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume.",
        "Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon.",
        "But it rusted and cankered at your father\u2019s heart for years.\u201d \u201cWell, they were separated,\u201d said Monks, \u201cand what of that?\u201d \u201cWhen they had been separated for some time,\u201d returned Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cand your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends.",
        "This circumstance, at least, you know already.\u201d \u201cNot I,\u201d said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything.",
        "\u201cNot I.\u201d \u201cYour manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,\u201d returned Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cI speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one and thirty\u2014for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry.",
        "Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?\u201d \u201cI have nothing to disclose,\u201d rejoined Monks.",
        "\u201cYou must talk on if you will.\u201d \u201cThese new friends, then,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cwere a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half a year before, and left him with two children\u2014there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived.",
        "They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s this to me?\u201d asked Monks.",
        "\u201cThey resided,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, without seeming to hear the interruption, \u201cin a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.",
        "Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other.",
        "Your father was gifted as few men are.",
        "He had his sister\u2019s soul and person.",
        "As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.",
        "I would that it had ended there.",
        "His daughter did the same.\u201d The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed: \u201cThe end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.\u201d \u201cYour tale is of the longest,\u201d observed Monks, moving restlessly in his chair.",
        "\u201cIt is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,\u201d returned Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cand such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief.",
        "At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often\u2014it is no uncommon case\u2014died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs\u2014Money.",
        "It was necessary that he should immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion.",
        "He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will\u2014_no will_\u2014so that the whole property fell to her and you.\u201d At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker.",
        "As Mr.",
        "Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands.",
        "\u201cBefore he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other\u2019s face, \u201che came to me.\u201d \u201cI never heard of that,\u201d interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.",
        "\u201cHe came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture\u2014a portrait painted by himself\u2014a likeness of this poor girl\u2014which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey.",
        "He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country\u2014I guessed too well he would not fly alone\u2014and never see it more.",
        "Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both\u2014even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth.",
        "Alas! _That_ was the last time.",
        "I had no letter, and I never saw him more.\u201d \u201cI went,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, after a short pause, \u201cI went, when all was over, to the scene of his\u2014I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him\u2014of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.",
        "The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night.",
        "Why, or whither, none can tell.\u201d Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph.",
        "\u201cWhen your brother,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other\u2019s chair, \u201cWhen your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d cried Monks.",
        "\u201cBy me,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cI told you I should interest you before long.",
        "I say by me\u2014I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for aught he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears.",
        "When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.",
        "Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream.",
        "I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Monks hastily.",
        "\u201cBecause you know it well.\u201d \u201cI!\u201d \u201cDenial to me is vain,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cI shall show you that I know more than that.\u201d \u201cYou\u2014you\u2014can\u2019t prove anything against me,\u201d stammered Monks.",
        "\u201cI defy you to do it!\u201d \u201cWe shall see,\u201d returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.",
        "\u201cI lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him.",
        "Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West Indies\u2014whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother\u2019s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here\u2014I made the voyage.",
        "You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London, but no one could tell where.",
        "I returned.",
        "Your agents had no clue to your residence.",
        "You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.",
        "I wearied them with new applications.",
        "I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.\u201d \u201cAnd now you do see me,\u201d said Monks, rising boldly, \u201cwhat then? Fraud and robbery are high sounding words\u2014justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man\u2019s Brother! You don\u2019t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don\u2019t even know that.\u201d \u201cI _did not_,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, rising too; \u201cbut within the last fortnight I have learnt it all.",
        "You have a brother; you know it, and him.",
        "There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death.",
        "It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father.",
        "You repaired to the place of his birth.",
        "There existed proofs\u2014proofs long suppressed\u2014of his birth and parentage.",
        "Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \u2018_the only proofs of the boy\u2019s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\u2019 Unworthy son, coward, liar,\u2014you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,\u2014you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,\u2014you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father\u2019s heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind\u2014you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!\u201d \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges.",
        "\u201cEvery word!\u201d cried the gentleman, \u201cevery word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me.",
        "Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue.",
        "Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d interposed Monks.",
        "\u201cI\u2014I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.",
        "I didn\u2019t know the cause.",
        "I thought it was a common quarrel.\u201d \u201cIt was the partial disclosure of your secrets,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cWill you disclose the whole?\u201d \u201cYes, I will.\u201d \u201cSet your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?\u201d \u201cThat I promise too.\u201d \u201cRemain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?\u201d \u201cIf you insist upon that, I\u2019ll do that also,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cYou must do more than that,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cMake restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.",
        "You have not forgotten the provisions of the will.",
        "Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please.",
        "In this world you need meet no more.\u201d While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr.",
        "Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation.",
        "\u201cThe man will be taken,\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cHe will be taken tonight!\u201d \u201cThe murderer?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d replied the other.",
        "\u201cHis dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.",
        "Spies are hovering about in every direction.",
        "I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape.",
        "A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government tonight.\u201d \u201cI will give fifty more,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cand proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.",
        "Where is Mr.",
        "Maylie?\u201d \u201cHarry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cand mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.\u201d \u201cFagin,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cwhat of him?\u201d \u201cWhen I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time.",
        "They\u2019re sure of him.\u201d \u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Brownlow, in a low voice, of Monks.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d he replied.",
        "\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014will be secret with me?\u201d \u201cI will.",
        "Remain here till I return.",
        "It is your only hope of safety.\u201d They left the room, and the door was again locked.",
        "\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked the doctor in a whisper.",
        "\u201cAll that I could hope to do, and even more.",
        "Coupling the poor girl\u2019s intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend\u2019s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.",
        "Write and appoint the evening after tomorrow, at seven, for the meeting.",
        "We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest: especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now.",
        "But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.",
        "Which way have they taken?\u201d \u201cDrive straight to the office and you will be in time,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Losberne.",
        "\u201cI will remain here.\u201d The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable.",
        "CHAPTER L.",
        "THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close built low roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.",
        "To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion.",
        "The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman\u2019s door, and stream from the house parapet and windows.",
        "Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast heavers, coal whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner.",
        "Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.",
        "In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark, stands Jacob\u2019s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch.",
        "It is a creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name.",
        "At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him.",
        "Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it\u2014as some have done; dirt besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of Folly Ditch.",
        "In Jacob\u2019s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.",
        "Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.",
        "The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.",
        "They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob\u2019s Island.",
        "In an upper room of one of these houses\u2014a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described\u2014there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.",
        "One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr.",
        "Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion.",
        "This man was a returned transport, and his name was Kags.",
        "\u201cI wish,\u201d said Toby turning to Mr.",
        "Chitling, \u201cthat you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you, blunder head!\u201d said Kags.",
        "\u201cWell, I thought you\u2019d have been a little more glad to see me than this,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Chitling, with a melancholy air.",
        "\u201cWhy, look\u2019e, young gentleman,\u201d said Toby, \u201cwhen a man keeps himself so very ex clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it\u2019s rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.\u201d \u201cEspecially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that\u2019s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,\u201d added Mr.",
        "Kags.",
        "There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil may care swagger, turned to Chitling and said, \u201cWhen was Fagin took then?\u201d \u201cJust at dinner time\u2014two o\u2019clock this afternoon.",
        "Charley and I made our lucky up the wash us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty water butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.\u201d \u201cAnd Bet?\u201d \u201cPoor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,\u201d replied Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, \u201cand went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait weskut on her and took her to the hospital\u2014and there she is.\u201d \u201cWot\u2019s come of young Bates?\u201d demanded Kags.",
        "\u201cHe hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d replied Chitling.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken\u2014I went up there and see it with my own eyes\u2014is filled with traps.\u201d \u201cThis is a smash,\u201d observed Toby, biting his lips.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s more than one will go with this.\u201d \u201cThe sessions are on,\u201d said Kags: \u201cif they get the inquest over, and Bolter turns King\u2019s evidence: as of course he will, from what he\u2019s said already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he\u2019ll swing in six days from this, by G\u2014!\u201d \u201cYou should have heard the people groan,\u201d said Chitling; \u201cthe officers fought like devils, or they\u2019d have torn him away.",
        "He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along.",
        "You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends.",
        "I can see \u2019em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst \u2019em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they\u2019d tear his heart out!\u201d The horror stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted.",
        "While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and Sikes\u2019s dog bounded into the room.",
        "They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.",
        "The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d said Toby when they had returned.",
        "\u201cHe can\u2019t be coming here.",
        "I\u2014I\u2014hope not.\u201d \u201cIf he was coming here, he\u2019d have come with the dog,\u201d said Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.",
        "\u201cHere! Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s drunk it all up, every drop,\u201d said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence.",
        "\u201cCovered with mud\u2014lame\u2014half blind\u2014he must have come a long way.\u201d \u201cWhere can he have come from!\u201d exclaimed Toby.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he\u2019s been many a time and often.",
        "But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!\u201d \u201cHe\u201d\u2014(none of them called the murderer by his old name)\u2014\u201cHe can\u2019t have made away with himself.",
        "What do you think?\u201d said Chitling.",
        "Toby shook his head.",
        "\u201cIf he had,\u201d said Kags, \u201cthe dog \u2019ud want to lead us away to where he did it.",
        "I think he\u2019s got out of the country, and left the dog behind.",
        "He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn\u2019t be so easy.\u201d This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody.",
        "It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table.",
        "The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position.",
        "They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound.",
        "They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.",
        "They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.",
        "\u201cYoung Bates,\u201d said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself.",
        "The knocking came again.",
        "No, it wasn\u2019t he.",
        "He never knocked like that.",
        "Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.",
        "There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.",
        "The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.",
        "\u201cWe must let him in,\u201d he said, taking up the candle.",
        "\u201cIsn\u2019t there any help for it?\u201d asked the other man in a hoarse voice.",
        "\u201cNone.",
        "He _must_ come in.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t leave us in the dark,\u201d said Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.",
        "Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat.",
        "He drew them slowly off.",
        "Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days\u2019 growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.",
        "He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall\u2014as close as it would go\u2014and ground it against it\u2014and sat down.",
        "Not a word had been exchanged.",
        "He looked from one to another in silence.",
        "If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted.",
        "When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.",
        "They seemed never to have heard its tones before.",
        "\u201cHow came that dog here?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cAlone.",
        "Three hours ago.\u201d \u201cTonight\u2019s paper says that Fagin\u2019s took.",
        "Is it true, or a lie?\u201d \u201cTrue.\u201d They were silent again.",
        "\u201cDamn you all!\u201d said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.",
        "\u201cHave you nothing to say to me?\u201d There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.",
        "\u201cYou that keep this house,\u201d said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, \u201cdo you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?\u201d \u201cYou may stop here, if you think it safe,\u201d returned the person addressed, after some hesitation.",
        "Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it: and said, \u201cIs\u2014it\u2014the body\u2014is it buried?\u201d They shook their heads.",
        "\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it!\u201d he retorted with the same glance behind him.",
        "\u201cWot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for?\u2014Who\u2019s that knocking?\u201d Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him.",
        "Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure.",
        "\u201cToby,\u201d said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you tell me this, downstairs?\u201d There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.",
        "Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.",
        "\u201cLet me go into some other room,\u201d said the boy, retreating still farther.",
        "\u201cCharley!\u201d said Sikes, stepping forward.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t you\u2014don\u2019t you know me?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t come nearer me,\u201d answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cYou monster!\u201d The man stopped half way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes\u2019s eyes sunk gradually to the ground.",
        "\u201cWitness you three,\u201d cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke.",
        "\u201cWitness you three\u2014I\u2019m not afraid of him\u2014if they come here after him, I\u2019ll give him up; I will.",
        "I tell you out at once.",
        "He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I\u2019ll give him up.",
        "I\u2019d give him up if he was to be boiled alive.",
        "Murder! Help! If there\u2019s the pluck of a man among you three, you\u2019ll help me.",
        "Murder! Help! Down with him!\u201d Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.",
        "The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.",
        "They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer\u2019s breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.",
        "The contest, however, was too unequal to last long.",
        "Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.",
        "There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps\u2014endless they seemed in number\u2014crossing the nearest wooden bridge.",
        "One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.",
        "The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.",
        "Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.",
        "\u201cHelp!\u201d shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s here! Break down the door!\u201d \u201cIn the King\u2019s name,\u201d cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder.",
        "\u201cBreak down the door!\u201d screamed the boy.",
        "\u201cI tell you they\u2019ll never open it.",
        "Run straight to the room where the light is.",
        "Break down the door!\u201d Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.",
        "\u201cOpen the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell babe,\u201d cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.",
        "\u201cThat door.",
        "Quick!\u201d He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key.",
        "\u201cIs the downstairs door fast?\u201d \u201cDouble locked and chained,\u201d replied Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.",
        "\u201cThe panels\u2014are they strong?\u201d \u201cLined with sheet iron.\u201d \u201cAnd the windows too?\u201d \u201cYes, and the windows.\u201d \u201cDamn you!\u201d cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd.",
        "\u201cDo your worst! I\u2019ll cheat you yet!\u201d Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.",
        "Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead.",
        "Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others, \u201cTwenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!\u201d The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.",
        "Some called for ladders, some for sledge hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.",
        "\u201cThe tide,\u201d cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out, \u201cthe tide was in as I came up.",
        "Give me a rope, a long rope.",
        "They\u2019re all in front.",
        "I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off that way.",
        "Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.\u201d The panic stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house top.",
        "All the windows in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body.",
        "But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.",
        "He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.",
        "The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.",
        "The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers.",
        "Again and again it rose.",
        "Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him.",
        "On pressed the people from the front\u2014on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion.",
        "The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house top.",
        "Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.",
        "Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch.",
        "\u201cThey have him now,\u201d cried a man on the nearest bridge.",
        "\u201cHurrah!\u201d The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.",
        "\u201cI will give fifty pounds,\u201d cried an old gentleman from the same quarter, \u201cto the man who takes him alive.",
        "I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.\u201d There was another roar.",
        "At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room.",
        "The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell mell to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out.",
        "The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased.",
        "The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion.",
        "Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second.",
        "He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.",
        "At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm pits, and when the old gentleman before mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down\u2014at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.",
        "\u201cThe eyes again!\u201d he cried in an unearthly screech.",
        "Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet.",
        "The noose was on his neck.",
        "It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.",
        "He fell for five and thirty feet.",
        "There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand.",
        "The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely.",
        "The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for God\u2019s sake.",
        "A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man\u2019s shoulders.",
        "Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains.",
        "CHAPTER LI.",
        "AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN MONEY The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when Oliver found himself, at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, in a travelling carriage rolling fast towards his native town.",
        "Maylie, and Rose, and Mrs.",
        "Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr.",
        "Brownlow followed in a post chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned.",
        "They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.",
        "He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.",
        "Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense.",
        "The same kind friend had, with Mr.",
        "Losberne\u2019s assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that had so recently taken place.",
        "\u201cIt was quite true,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.\u201d So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.",
        "But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.",
        "\u201cSee there, there!\u201d cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window; \u201cthat\u2019s the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!\u201d \u201cYou will see him soon,\u201d replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own.",
        "\u201cYou shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cand we\u2019ll\u2014we\u2019ll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well,\u2014shall we?\u201d Rose nodded \u201cyes,\u201d for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak.",
        "\u201cYou will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,\u201d said Oliver.",
        "\u201cIt will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again\u2014I know that too\u2014to think how changed he is; you did the same with me.",
        "He said \u2018God bless you\u2019 to me when I ran away,\u201d cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion; \u201cand I will say \u2018God bless you\u2019 now, and show him how I love him for it!\u201d As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds.",
        "There was Sowerberry\u2019s the undertaker\u2019s just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it\u2014there were all the well known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected\u2014there was Gamfield\u2019s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public house door\u2014there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street\u2014there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again\u2014there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well\u2014there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream.",
        "But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.",
        "They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was Mr.",
        "Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head\u2014no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep.",
        "There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.",
        "Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down.",
        "Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room.",
        "The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart.",
        "Once, Mrs.",
        "Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.",
        "All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable.",
        "They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices.",
        "At length, when nine o\u2019clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, Mr.",
        "Losberne and Mr.",
        "Grimwig entered the room, followed by Mr.",
        "Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the window of his little room.",
        "Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door.",
        "Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.",
        "\u201cThis is a painful task,\u201d said he, \u201cbut these declarations, which have been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here.",
        "I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said the person addressed, turning away his face.",
        "\u201cQuick.",
        "I have almost done enough, I think.",
        "Don\u2019t keep me here.\u201d \u201cThis child,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head, \u201cis your half brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose heart he might have heard.",
        "\u201cThat is the bastard child.\u201d \u201cThe term you use,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, sternly, \u201cis a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world.",
        "It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it.",
        "Let that pass.",
        "He was born in this town.\u201d \u201cIn the workhouse of this town,\u201d was the sullen reply.",
        "\u201cYou have the story there.\u201d He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.",
        "\u201cI must have it here, too,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, looking round upon the listeners.",
        "\u201cListen then! You!\u201d returned Monks.",
        "\u201cHis father being taken ill at Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from Paris and took me with her\u2014to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her.",
        "He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died.",
        "Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself\u201d; he addressed himself to Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cand enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead.",
        "One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.\u201d \u201cWhat of the letter?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cThe letter?\u2014A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her.",
        "He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery\u2014to be explained one day\u2014prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back.",
        "She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement.",
        "He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his.",
        "He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her\u2014prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before\u2014and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted.",
        "I believe he had.\u201d \u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, as Oliver\u2019s tears fell fast.",
        "Monks was silent.",
        "\u201cThe will,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, speaking for him, \u201cwas in the same spirit as the letter.",
        "He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds.",
        "The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions\u2014one for Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age.",
        "If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.",
        "He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the mother, and his conviction\u2014only strengthened by approaching death\u2014that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature.",
        "If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.\u201d \u201cMy mother,\u201d said Monks, in a louder tone, \u201cdid what a woman should have done.",
        "She burnt this will.",
        "The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot.",
        "The girl\u2019s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate\u2014I love her for it now\u2014could add.",
        "Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed.",
        "The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.\u201d There was a short silence here, until Mr.",
        "Brownlow took up the thread of the narrative.",
        "\u201cYears after this,\u201d he said, \u201cthis man\u2019s\u2014Edward Leeford\u2019s\u2014mother came to me.",
        "He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts.",
        "She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died.",
        "Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made.",
        "They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to France.\u201d \u201cThere she died,\u201d said Monks, \u201cafter a lingering illness; and, on her death bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved\u2014though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.",
        "She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive.",
        "I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by dragging it, if I could, to the very gallows foot.",
        "She was right.",
        "He came in my way at last.",
        "I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!\u201d As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr.",
        "Brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.",
        "\u201cThe locket and ring?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, turning to Monks.",
        "\u201cI bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,\u201d answered Monks without raising his eyes.",
        "\u201cYou know what became of them.\u201d Mr.",
        "Brownlow merely nodded to Mr.",
        "Grimwig, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs.",
        "Bumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him.",
        "\u201cDo my hi\u2019s deceive me!\u201d cried Mr.",
        "Bumble, with ill feigned enthusiasm, \u201cor is that little Oliver? Oh O li ver, if you know\u2019d how I\u2019ve been a grieving for you\u2014\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, fool,\u201d murmured Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cIsn\u2019t natur, natur, Mrs.",
        "Bumble?\u201d remonstrated the workhouse master.",
        "\u201cCan\u2019t I be supposed to feel\u2014_I_ as brought him up porochially\u2014when I see him a setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description! I always loved that boy as if he\u2019d been my\u2014my\u2014my own grandfather,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.",
        "\u201cMaster Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, Oliver.\u201d \u201cCome, sir,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, tartly; \u201csuppress your feelings.\u201d \u201cI will do my endeavours, sir,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cHow do you do, sir? I hope you are very well.\u201d This salutation was addressed to Mr.",
        "Brownlow, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple.",
        "He inquired, as he pointed to Monks, \u201cDo you know that person?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Bumble flatly.",
        "\u201cPerhaps _you_ don\u2019t?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, addressing her spouse.",
        "\u201cI never saw him in all my life,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cNor sold him anything, perhaps?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "\u201cYou never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied the matron.",
        "\u201cWhy are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?\u201d Again Mr.",
        "Brownlow nodded to Mr.",
        "Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness.",
        "But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked.",
        "\u201cYou shut the door the night old Sally died,\u201d said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws.",
        "\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d \u201cWe heard her try to tell you what she\u2019d done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker\u2019s shop,\u201d said the first.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d added the second, \u201cand it was a \u2018locket and gold ring.\u2019 We found out that, and saw it given you.",
        "We were by.",
        "Oh! we were by.\u201d \u201cAnd we know more than that,\u201d resumed the first, \u201cfor she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.\u201d \u201cWould you like to see the pawnbroker himself?\u201d asked Mr.",
        "Grimwig with a motion towards the door.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d replied the woman; \u201cif he\u201d\u2014she pointed to Monks\u2014\u201chas been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.",
        "I _did_ sell them, and they\u2019re where you\u2019ll never get them.",
        "What then?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow, \u201cexcept that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again.",
        "You may leave the room.\u201d \u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr.",
        "Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: \u201cI hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?\u201d \u201cIndeed it will,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cYou may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.\u201d \u201cIt was all Mrs.",
        "Bumble.",
        "She _would_ do it,\u201d urged Mr.",
        "Bumble; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.",
        "\u201cThat is no excuse,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cYou were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.\u201d \u201cIf the law supposes that,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, \u201cthe law is a ass\u2014a idiot.",
        "If that\u2019s the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience\u2014by experience.\u201d Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr.",
        "Bumble fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs.",
        "\u201cYoung lady,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, turning to Rose, \u201cgive me your hand.",
        "Do not tremble.",
        "You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.\u201d \u201cIf they have\u2014I do not know how they can, but if they have\u2014any reference to me,\u201d said Rose, \u201cpray let me hear them at some other time.",
        "I have not strength or spirits now.\u201d \u201cNay,\u201d returned the old gentleman, drawing her arm through his; \u201cyou have more fortitude than this, I am sure.",
        "Do you know this young lady, sir?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Monks.",
        "\u201cI never saw you before,\u201d said Rose faintly.",
        "\u201cI have seen you often,\u201d returned Monks.",
        "\u201cThe father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cWhat was the fate of the other\u2014the child?\u201d \u201cThe child,\u201d replied Monks, \u201cwhen her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced\u2014the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow, signing to Mrs.",
        "Maylie to approach.",
        "\u201cGo on!\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t find the spot to which these people had repaired,\u201d said Monks, \u201cbut where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way.",
        "My mother found it, after a year of cunning search\u2014ay, and found the child.\u201d \u201cShe took it, did she?\u201d \u201cNo.",
        "The people were poor and began to sicken\u2014at least the man did\u2014of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send.",
        "She didn\u2019t quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child\u2019s unhappiness, but told the history of the sister\u2019s shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.",
        "The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home.",
        "There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy.",
        "I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.\u201d \u201cDo you see her now?\u201d \u201cYes.",
        "Leaning on your arm.\u201d \u201cBut not the less my niece,\u201d cried Mrs.",
        "Maylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms; \u201cnot the less my dearest child.",
        "I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world.",
        "My sweet companion, my own dear girl!\u201d \u201cThe only friend I ever had,\u201d cried Rose, clinging to her.",
        "\u201cThe kindest, best of friends.",
        "My heart will burst.",
        "I cannot bear all this.\u201d \u201cYou have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, embracing her tenderly.",
        "\u201cCome, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here\u2014look, look, my dear!\u201d \u201cNot aunt,\u201d cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; \u201cI\u2019ll never call her aunt\u2014sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!\u201d Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.",
        "A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment.",
        "Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.",
        "They were a long, long time alone.",
        "A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without.",
        "Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to Harry Maylie.",
        "\u201cI know it all,\u201d he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl.",
        "\u201cDear Rose, I know it all.\u201d \u201cI am not here by accident,\u201d he added after a lengthened silence; \u201cnor have I heard all this tonight, for I knew it yesterday\u2014only yesterday.",
        "Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?\u201d \u201cStay,\u201d said Rose.",
        "\u201cYou _do_ know all.\u201d \u201cAll.",
        "You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d \u201cNot to press you to alter your determination,\u201d pursued the young man, \u201cbut to hear you repeat it, if you would.",
        "I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.\u201d \u201cThe same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,\u201d said Rose firmly.",
        "\u201cIf I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should tonight? It is a struggle,\u201d said Rose, \u201cbut one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.\u201d \u201cThe disclosure of tonight,\u201d\u2014Harry began.",
        "\u201cThe disclosure of tonight,\u201d replied Rose softly, \u201cleaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.\u201d \u201cYou harden your heart against me, Rose,\u201d urged her lover.",
        "\u201cOh Harry, Harry,\u201d said the young lady, bursting into tears; \u201cI wish I could, and spare myself this pain.\u201d \u201cThen why inflict it on yourself?\u201d said Harry, taking her hand.",
        "\u201cThink, dear Rose, think what you have heard tonight.\u201d \u201cAnd what have I heard! What have I heard!\u201d cried Rose.",
        "\u201cThat a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all\u2014there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.\u201d \u201cNot yet, not yet,\u201d said the young man, detaining her as she rose.",
        "\u201cMy hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love for you: have undergone a change.",
        "I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home\u2014a heart and home\u2014yes, dearest Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean!\u201d she faltered.",
        "\u201cI mean but this\u2014that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it.",
        "This I have done.",
        "Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right.",
        "Such power and patronage: such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England\u2019s richest county; and by one village church\u2014mine, Rose, my own!\u2014there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold.",
        "This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, waking up, and pulling his pocket handkerchief from over his head.",
        "Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.",
        "Neither Mrs.",
        "Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation.",
        "\u201cI had serious thoughts of eating my head tonight,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Grimwig, \u201cfor I began to think I should get nothing else.",
        "I\u2019ll take the liberty, if you\u2019ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.\u201d Mr.",
        "Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and Mr.",
        "Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a clergyman.",
        "\u201cOliver, my child,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Maylie, \u201cwhere have you been, and why do you look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this moment.",
        "What is the matter?\u201d It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.",
        "Poor Dick was dead! CHAPTER LII.",
        "FAGIN\u2019S LAST NIGHT ALIVE The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces.",
        "Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space.",
        "From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man\u2014Fagin.",
        "Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.",
        "He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury.",
        "At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf.",
        "Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot.",
        "He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.",
        "A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.",
        "Looking round, he saw that the jurymen had turned together, to consider their verdict.",
        "As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence.",
        "A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay.",
        "But in no one face\u2014not even among the women, of whom there were many there\u2014could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all absorbing interest that he should be condemned.",
        "As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge.",
        "Hush! They only sought permission to retire.",
        "He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless.",
        "The jailer touched him on the shoulder.",
        "He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.",
        "The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.",
        "He looked up into the gallery again.",
        "Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot.",
        "There was one young man sketching his face in a little note book.",
        "He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done.",
        "In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on.",
        "There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.",
        "He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another.",
        "Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it.",
        "Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.",
        "Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold\u2014and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it\u2014and then went on to think again.",
        "At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door.",
        "The jury returned, and passed him close.",
        "He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.",
        "Perfect stillness ensued\u2014not a rustle\u2014not a breath\u2014Guilty.",
        "The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder.",
        "It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.",
        "The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him.",
        "He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man\u2014an old man\u2014and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again.",
        "The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture.",
        "A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively.",
        "The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear.",
        "But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.",
        "His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away.",
        "He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed.",
        "They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.",
        "There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed.",
        "He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.",
        "Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there\u2014alone.",
        "He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts.",
        "After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word.",
        "These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered.",
        "To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead\u2014that was the end.",
        "To be hanged by the neck till he was dead.",
        "As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means.",
        "They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them.",
        "He had seen some of them die,\u2014and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips.",
        "With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes! Some of them might have inhabited that very cell\u2014sat upon that very spot.",
        "It was very dark; why didn\u2019t they bring a light? The cell had been built for many years.",
        "Scores of men must have passed their last hours there.",
        "It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies\u2014the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.\u2014Light, light! At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.",
        "Then came the night\u2014dark, dismal, silent night.",
        "Other watchers are glad to hear this church clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day.",
        "To him they brought despair.",
        "The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound\u2014Death.",
        "What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.",
        "The day passed off.",
        "Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as come\u2014and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.",
        "At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair.",
        "Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses.",
        "They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off.",
        "Saturday night.",
        "He had only one night more to live.",
        "And as he thought of this, the day broke\u2014Sunday.",
        "It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon.",
        "He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention.",
        "He had sat there, awake, but dreaming.",
        "Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they\u2014used to such sights\u2014recoiled from him with horror.",
        "He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.",
        "He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past.",
        "He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth.",
        "His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up.",
        "Eight\u2014nine\u2014then.",
        "If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other\u2019s heels, where would he be, when they came round again! Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate.",
        "At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven\u2014 Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that.",
        "The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged tomorrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him.",
        "From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.",
        "These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene.",
        "By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.",
        "The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr.",
        "Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs.",
        "They were immediately admitted into the lodge.",
        "\u201cIs the young gentleman to come too, sir?\u201d said the man whose duty it was to conduct them.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not a sight for children, sir.\u201d \u201cIt is not indeed, my friend,\u201d rejoined Mr.",
        "Brownlow; \u201cbut my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well\u2014even at the cost of some pain and fear\u2014that he should see him now.\u201d These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.",
        "The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.",
        "\u201cThis,\u201d said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence\u2014\u201cthis is the place he passes through.",
        "If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.\u201d He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door.",
        "There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men\u2019s voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.",
        "They were putting up the scaffold.",
        "From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand.",
        "Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys.",
        "The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.",
        "They did so.",
        "The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man.",
        "His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision.",
        "\u201cGood boy, Charley\u2014well done\u2014\u201d he mumbled.",
        "\u201cOliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too\u2014quite the gentleman now\u2014quite the\u2014take that boy away to bed!\u201d The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.",
        "\u201cTake him away to bed!\u201d cried Fagin.",
        "\u201cDo you hear me, some of you? He has been the\u2014the\u2014somehow the cause of all this.",
        "It\u2019s worth the money to bring him up to it\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat, Bill; never mind the girl\u2014Bolter\u2019s throat as deep as you can cut.",
        "Saw his head off!\u201d \u201cFagin,\u201d said the jailer.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial.",
        "\u201cAn old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down.",
        "\u201cHere\u2019s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose.",
        "Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t be one long,\u201d he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror.",
        "\u201cStrike them all dead! What right have they to butcher me?\u201d As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there.",
        "\u201cSteady,\u201d said the turnkey, still holding him down.",
        "\u201cNow, sir, tell him what you want.",
        "Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.\u201d \u201cYou have some papers,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow advancing, \u201cwhich were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all a lie together,\u201d replied Fagin.",
        "\u201cI haven\u2019t one\u2014not one.\u201d \u201cFor the love of God,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Brownlow solemnly, \u201cdo not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.",
        "You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain.",
        "Where are those papers?\u201d \u201cOliver,\u201d cried Fagin, beckoning to him.",
        "\u201cHere, here! Let me whisper to you.\u201d \u201cI am not afraid,\u201d said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr.",
        "Brownlow\u2019s hand.",
        "\u201cThe papers,\u201d said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, \u201care in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front room.",
        "I want to talk to you, my dear.",
        "I want to talk to you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d returned Oliver.",
        "\u201cLet me say a prayer.",
        "Do! Let me say one prayer.",
        "Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.\u201d \u201cOutside, outside,\u201d replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head.",
        "\u201cSay I\u2019ve gone to sleep\u2014they\u2019ll believe you.",
        "You can get me out, if you take me so.",
        "Now then, now then!\u201d \u201cOh! God forgive this wretched man!\u201d cried the boy with a burst of tears.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Fagin.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019ll help us on.",
        "This door first.",
        "If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don\u2019t you mind, but hurry on.",
        "Now, now, now!\u201d \u201cHave you nothing else to ask him, sir?\u201d inquired the turnkey.",
        "\u201cNo other question,\u201d replied Mr.",
        "Brownlow.",
        "\u201cIf I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position\u2014\u201d \u201cNothing will do that, sir,\u201d replied the man, shaking his head.",
        "\u201cYou had better leave him.\u201d The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.",
        "\u201cPress on, press on,\u201d cried Fagin.",
        "\u201cSoftly, but not so slow.",
        "Faster, faster!\u201d The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back.",
        "He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.",
        "It was some time before they left the prison.",
        "Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk.",
        "Day was dawning when they again emerged.",
        "A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.",
        "Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all\u2014the black stage, the cross beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death.",
        "CHAPTER LIII.",
        "AND LAST The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.",
        "The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words.",
        "Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman\u2019s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.",
        "Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter in law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know\u2014the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.",
        "It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds.",
        "By the provisions of his father\u2019s will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr.",
        "Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded.",
        "Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison.",
        "As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin\u2019s gang.",
        "Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son.",
        "Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver\u2019s warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.",
        "Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.",
        "For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor\u2019s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.",
        "Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.",
        "In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.",
        "Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr.",
        "Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.",
        "He is accordingly visited by Mr.",
        "Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year.",
        "On all such occasions, Mr.",
        "Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one.",
        "On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman\u2019s face: always informing Mr.",
        "Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so.",
        "It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr.",
        "Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr.",
        "Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.",
        "Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.",
        "After some consideration, he went into business as an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence.",
        "His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire.",
        "The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty.",
        "Sometimes Mr.",
        "Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.",
        "Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.",
        "As to Mr.",
        "Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last named boy quite grey.",
        "They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr.",
        "Brownlow, and Mr.",
        "Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.",
        "Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes\u2019s crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.",
        "Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action.",
        "He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer\u2019s drudge, and a carrier\u2019s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.",
        "And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures.",
        "I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.",
        "I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts.",
        "I would paint her the life and joy of the fire side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister\u2019s child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.",
        "These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech\u2014I would fain recall them every one.",
        "How Mr.",
        "Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become\u2014how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing\u2014how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them\u2014these are all matters which need not to be told.",
        "I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.",
        "Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: \u201cAGNES.\u201d There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love\u2014the love beyond the grave\u2014of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook.",
        "I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring."
