Down the Rabbit Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \u201cI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to night, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters. It was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018_poison_\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. However, this bottle was _not_ marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart, custard, pine apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201d And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d said Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!\u201d Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which way?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears \u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good bye, feet!\u201d (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201d And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must go by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look! _Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with Alice\u2019s love_). Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go. Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is to day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, _that\u2019s_ the great puzzle!\u201d And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, _she\u2019s_ she, and _I\u2019m_ I, and\u2014oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\u2014no, _that\u2019s_ all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018_How doth the little_\u2014\u2019\u201d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2014 \u201cHow doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! \u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here!\u201d As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201cHow _can_ I have done that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be growing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. \u201cThat _was_ a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand now for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than ever,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to day.\u201d Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. \u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out of the way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she began: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2014of a mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201d) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. \u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cO\u00f9 est ma chatte?\u201d which was the first sentence in her French lesson book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d \u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould _you_ like cats if you were me?\u201d \u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d \u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u201cAre you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2014oh dear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. So she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. CHAPTER III. A Caucus Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than you, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said. At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I\u2019ll_ soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. \u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2014\u2019\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver. \u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily. \u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2014\u2019\u201d \u201cFound _what_?\u201d said the Duck. \u201cFound _it_,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d \u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u2018\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke. \u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2014\u201d \u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly. \u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus race.\u201d \u201cWhat _is_ a Caucus race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. \u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a race course, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u201c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d \u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked. \u201cWhy, _she_, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a piece, all round. \u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice. \u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly. \u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo. Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\u201d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered. Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could. The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. \u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. \u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. \u201cIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2014 \u201cFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \u2018Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.\u2014Come, I\u2019ll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I\u2019ve nothing to do.\u2019 Said the mouse to the cur, \u2018Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll be judge, I\u2019ll be jury,\u2019 Said cunning old Fury: \u2018I\u2019ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d \u201cI had _not!_\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily. \u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d \u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d The Mouse only growled in reply. \u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker. \u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _your_ temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d \u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d \u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory. Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u201cThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. \u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. \u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201d By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass. There was no label this time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201cNow I can do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?\u201d Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. \u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit hole\u2014and yet\u2014and yet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more _here_.\u201d \u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I _never_ get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but then\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like _that!_\u201d \u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all for any lesson books!\u201d And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. \u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201d \u201c_That_ you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And then a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201d \u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and help me out of _this!_\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d \u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d) \u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201d \u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number of cucumber frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could!_ I\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2014No, tie \u2019em together first\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2014It was Bill, I fancy\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, _I_ shan\u2019t! _You_ do it!\u2014_That_ I won\u2019t, then!\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d \u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to herself. \u201cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I _think_ I can kick a little!\u201d She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then silence, and then another confusion of voices\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2014Brandy now\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201d Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought Alice,) \u201cWell, I hardly know\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack in the box, and up I goes like a sky rocket!\u201d \u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others. \u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d \u201cA barrowful of _what?_\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that again!\u201d which produced another dead silence. Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make _some_ change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201d It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance. \u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2014how _is_ it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201d The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else. CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, \u201cI\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain yourself!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t explain _myself_, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely, \u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.\u201d \u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are _you?_\u201d Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such _very_ short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar. Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. \u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again. \u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. \u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar. Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t remember _what_ things?\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u201cHow doth the little busy bee,\u201d but it all came different!\u201d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. \u201cRepeat, \u2018_You are old, Father William_,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar. Alice folded her hands, and began:\u2014 \u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said, \u201cAnd your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014 Do you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d \u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son, \u201cI feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.\u201d \u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door\u2014 Pray, what is the reason of that?\u201d \u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, \u201cI kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014 Allow me to sell you a couple?\u201d \u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014 Pray, how did you manage to do it?\u201d \u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.\u201d \u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014 What made you so awfully clever?\u201d \u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d Said his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d \u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cNot _quite_ right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the words have got altered.\u201d \u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. The Caterpillar was the first to speak. \u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201d \u201cI _don\u2019t_ know,\u201d said the Caterpillar. Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. \u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar. \u201cWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d \u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). \u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u201d \u201cOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\u201d thought Alice to herself. \u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. \u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. \u201cWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. \u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon. \u201cI\u2019m _not_ a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d \u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. \u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut I must be on the look out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. \u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2014I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d \u201cWell! _What_ are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201d \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. \u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201d \u201cI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d \u201cIt matters a good deal to _me_,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want _yours_: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d \u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen. The Fish Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. \u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for two reasons. First, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u201d And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. \u201cPlease, then,\u201d said Alice, \u201chow am I to get in?\u201d \u201cThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201d the Footman went on without attending to her, \u201cif we had the door between us. For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\u201d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \u201cBut perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u201d she said to herself; \u201chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\u201d she repeated, aloud. \u201cI shall sit here,\u201d the Footman remarked, \u201ctill tomorrow\u2014\u201d At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman\u2019s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. \u201c\u2014or next day, maybe,\u201d the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. \u201cHow am I to get in?\u201d asked Alice again, in a louder tone. \u201c_Are_ you to get in at all?\u201d said the Footman. \u201cThat\u2019s the first question, you know.\u201d It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \u201cIt\u2019s really dreadful,\u201d she muttered to herself, \u201cthe way all the creatures argue. It\u2019s enough to drive one crazy!\u201d The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. \u201cI shall sit here,\u201d he said, \u201con and off, for days and days.\u201d \u201cBut what am _I_ to do?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnything you like,\u201d said the Footman, and began whistling. \u201cOh, there\u2019s no use in talking to him,\u201d said Alice desperately: \u201che\u2019s perfectly idiotic!\u201d And she opened the door and went in. The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201d Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. \u201cPlease would you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u201cwhy your cat grins like that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cand that\u2019s why. Pig!\u201d She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\u2019t know that cats _could_ grin.\u201d \u201cThey all can,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand most of \u2019em do.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know of any that do,\u201d Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. \u201cYou don\u2019t know much,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand that\u2019s a fact.\u201d Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. \u201cOh, _please_ mind what you\u2019re doing!\u201d cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. \u201cOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\u201d as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. \u201cIf everybody minded their own business,\u201d the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \u201cthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.\u201d \u201cWhich would _not_ be an advantage,\u201d said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \u201cJust think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\u201d \u201cTalking of axes,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cchop off her head!\u201d Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: \u201cTwenty four hours, I _think_; or is it twelve? I\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t bother _me_,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cI never could abide figures!\u201d And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: \u201cSpeak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.\u201d CHORUS. (In which the cook and the baby joined): \u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014 \u201cI speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!\u201d CHORUS. \u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d \u201cHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u201d the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. \u201cI must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\u201d and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her. Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \u201cjust like a star fish,\u201d thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be murder to leave it behind?\u201d She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). \u201cDon\u2019t grunt,\u201d said Alice; \u201cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\u201d The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. \u201cBut perhaps it was only sobbing,\u201d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. No, there were no tears. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201d said Alice, seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind now!\u201d The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence. Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201cNow, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\u201d when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. \u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good natured, she thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. \u201cCheshire Puss,\u201d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u201cCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201d thought Alice, and she went on. \u201cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201d \u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201d said Alice. \u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201d said the Cat. \u201c\u2014so long as I get _somewhere_,\u201d Alice added as an explanation. \u201cOh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cif you only walk long enough.\u201d Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \u201cWhat sort of people live about here?\u201d \u201cIn _that_ direction,\u201d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u201clives a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\u201d waving the other paw, \u201clives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201d Alice remarked. \u201cOh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201d said the Cat: \u201cwe\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u201d \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m mad?\u201d said Alice. \u201cYou must be,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cor you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u201cAnd how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u201d \u201cTo begin with,\u201d said the Cat, \u201ca dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u201d \u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWell, then,\u201d the Cat went on, \u201cyou see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u201d \u201c_I_ call it purring, not growling,\u201d said Alice. \u201cCall it what you like,\u201d said the Cat. \u201cDo you play croquet with the Queen to day?\u201d \u201cI should like it very much,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. \u201cBy the bye, what became of the baby?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u201d \u201cIt turned into a pig,\u201d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way. \u201cI thought it would,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \u201cI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it was in March.\u201d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. \u201cDid you say pig, or fig?\u201d said the Cat. \u201cI said pig,\u201d replied Alice; \u201cand I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. \u201cWell! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cbut a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201d CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u201cVery uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u201cNo room! No room!\u201d they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u201cThere\u2019s _plenty_ of room!\u201d said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table. \u201cHave some wine,\u201d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u201cI don\u2019t see any wine,\u201d she remarked. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cThen it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u201d said Alice angrily. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was _your_ table,\u201d said Alice; \u201cit\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u201d \u201cYour hair wants cutting,\u201d said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. \u201cYou should learn not to make personal remarks,\u201d Alice said with some severity; \u201cit\u2019s very rude.\u201d The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_ was, \u201cWhy is a raven like a writing desk?\u201d \u201cCome, we shall have some fun now!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019ve begun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\u201d she added aloud. \u201cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cExactly so,\u201d said Alice. \u201cThen you should say what you mean,\u201d the March Hare went on. \u201cI do,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201cat least\u2014at least I mean what I say\u2014that\u2019s the same thing, you know.\u201d \u201cNot the same thing a bit!\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cYou might just as well say that \u2018I see what I eat\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I eat what I see\u2019!\u201d \u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the March Hare, \u201cthat \u2018I like what I get\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I get what I like\u2019!\u201d \u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \u201cthat \u2018I breathe when I sleep\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I sleep when I breathe\u2019!\u201d \u201cIt _is_ the same thing with you,\u201d said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks, which wasn\u2019t much. The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \u201cWhat day of the month is it?\u201d he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. Alice considered a little, and then said \u201cThe fourth.\u201d \u201cTwo days wrong!\u201d sighed the Hatter. \u201cI told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u201d he added looking angrily at the March Hare. \u201cIt was the _best_ butter,\u201d the March Hare meekly replied. \u201cYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u201d the Hatter grumbled: \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread knife.\u201d The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u201cIt was the _best_ butter, you know.\u201d Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u201cWhat a funny watch!\u201d she remarked. \u201cIt tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u201d \u201cWhy should it?\u201d muttered the Hatter. \u201cDoes _your_ watch tell you what year it is?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d Alice replied very readily: \u201cbut that\u2019s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\u201d \u201cWhich is just the case with _mine_,\u201d said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand you,\u201d she said, as politely as she could. \u201cThe Dormouse is asleep again,\u201d said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u201cOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u201d \u201cHave you guessed the riddle yet?\u201d the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \u201cNo, I give it up,\u201d Alice replied: \u201cwhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cNor I,\u201d said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. \u201cI think you might do something better with the time,\u201d she said, \u201cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u201d \u201cIf you knew Time as well as I do,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting _it_. It\u2019s _him_.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Alice. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \u201cI dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u201d \u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Alice cautiously replied: \u201cbut I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\u201d \u201cAh! that accounts for it,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cHe won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half past one, time for dinner!\u201d (\u201cI only wish it was,\u201d the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) \u201cThat would be grand, certainly,\u201d said Alice thoughtfully: \u201cbut then\u2014I shouldn\u2019t be hungry for it, you know.\u201d \u201cNot at first, perhaps,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cbut you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked.\u201d \u201cIs that the way _you_ manage?\u201d Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u201cNot I!\u201d he replied. \u201cWe quarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\u201d (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u201c\u2014it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing \u2018Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you\u2019re at!\u2019 You know the song, perhaps?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard something like it,\u201d said Alice. \u201cIt goes on, you know,\u201d the Hatter continued, \u201cin this way:\u2014 \u2018Up above the world you fly, Like a tea tray in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle\u2014\u2019\u201d Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \u201c_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\u201d and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop. \u201cWell, I\u2019d hardly finished the first verse,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cwhen the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \u2018He\u2019s murdering the time! Off with his head!\u2019\u201d \u201cHow dreadfully savage!\u201d exclaimed Alice. \u201cAnd ever since that,\u201d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \u201che won\u2019t do a thing I ask! It\u2019s always six o\u2019clock now.\u201d A bright idea came into Alice\u2019s head. \u201cIs that the reason so many tea things are put out here?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said the Hatter with a sigh: \u201cit\u2019s always tea time, and we\u2019ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\u201d \u201cThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\u201d said Alice. \u201cExactly so,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cas the things get used up.\u201d \u201cBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?\u201d Alice ventured to ask. \u201cSuppose we change the subject,\u201d the March Hare interrupted, yawning. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know one,\u201d said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal. \u201cThen the Dormouse shall!\u201d they both cried. \u201cWake up, Dormouse!\u201d And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201d he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \u201cI heard every word you fellows were saying.\u201d \u201cTell us a story!\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cYes, please do!\u201d pleaded Alice. \u201cAnd be quick about it,\u201d added the Hatter, \u201cor you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u201d \u201cOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,\u201d the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u201cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat did they live on?\u201d said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. \u201cThey lived on treacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u201d Alice gently remarked; \u201cthey\u2019d have been ill.\u201d \u201cSo they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c_very_ ill.\u201d Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u201cBut why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d \u201cTake some more tea,\u201d the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u201cI\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u201d Alice replied in an offended tone, \u201cso I can\u2019t take more.\u201d \u201cYou mean you can\u2019t take _less_,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cit\u2019s very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\u201d \u201cNobody asked _your_ opinion,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWho\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u201d the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \u201cWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u201cIt was a treacle well.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201d Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u201cSh! sh!\u201d and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u201cIf you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u201d \u201cNo, please go on!\u201d Alice said very humbly; \u201cI won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there may be _one_.\u201d \u201cOne, indeed!\u201d said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u201cAnd so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw, you know\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat did they draw?\u201d said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. \u201cTreacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. \u201cI want a clean cup,\u201d interrupted the Hatter: \u201clet\u2019s all move one place on.\u201d He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\u201d \u201cYou can draw water out of a water well,\u201d said the Hatter; \u201cso I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well\u2014eh, stupid?\u201d \u201cBut they were _in_ the well,\u201d Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark. \u201cOf course they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c\u2014well in.\u201d This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it. \u201cThey were learning to draw,\u201d the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \u201cand they drew all manner of things\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy with an M?\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said the March Hare. Alice was silent. The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \u201c\u2014that begins with an M, such as mouse traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say things are \u201cmuch of a muchness\u201d\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\u201d \u201cReally, now you ask me,\u201d said Alice, very much confused, \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d said the Hatter. This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. \u201cAt any rate I\u2019ll never go _there_ again!\u201d said Alice as she picked her way through the wood. \u201cIt\u2019s the stupidest tea party I ever was at in all my life!\u201d Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. \u201cThat\u2019s very curious!\u201d she thought. \u201cBut everything\u2019s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.\u201d And in she went. Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll manage better this time,\u201d she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_\u2014she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains. CHAPTER VIII. The Queen\u2019s Croquet Ground A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me like that!\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d said Five, in a sulky tone; \u201cSeven jogged my elbow.\u201d On which Seven looked up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!\u201d \u201c_You\u2019d_ better not talk!\u201d said Five. \u201cI heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d said the one who had spoken first. \u201cThat\u2019s none of _your_ business, Two!\u201d said Seven. \u201cYes, it _is_ his business!\u201d said Five, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell him\u2014it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions.\u201d Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun \u201cWell, of all the unjust things\u2014\u201d when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. \u201cWould you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, \u201cwhy you are painting those roses?\u201d Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u201cWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\u201d At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u201cThe Queen! The Queen!\u201d and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d \u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u201d \u201cAnd who are _these?_\u201d said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. \u201cHow should _I_ know?\u201d said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u201cIt\u2019s no business of _mine_.\u201d The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \u201cOff with her head! Off\u2014\u201d \u201cNonsense!\u201d said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u201cConsider, my dear: she is only a child!\u201d The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u201cTurn them over!\u201d The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. \u201cGet up!\u201d said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. \u201cLeave off that!\u201d screamed the Queen. \u201cYou make me giddy.\u201d And then, turning to the rose tree, she went on, \u201cWhat _have_ you been doing here?\u201d \u201cMay it please your Majesty,\u201d said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u201cwe were trying\u2014\u201d \u201c_I_ see!\u201d said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u201cOff with their heads!\u201d and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. \u201cYou shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u201d said Alice, and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. \u201cAre their heads off?\u201d shouted the Queen. \u201cTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u201d the soldiers shouted in reply. \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d shouted the Queen. \u201cCan you play croquet?\u201d The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. \u201cYes!\u201d shouted Alice. \u201cCome on, then!\u201d roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a very fine day!\u201d said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \u201cVery,\u201d said Alice: \u201c\u2014where\u2019s the Duchess?\u201d \u201cHush! Hush!\u201d said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \u201cShe\u2019s under sentence of execution.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d said Alice. \u201cDid you say \u2018What a pity!\u2019?\u201d the Rabbit asked. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Alice: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a pity. I said \u2018What for?\u2019\u201d \u201cShe boxed the Queen\u2019s ears\u2014\u201d the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. \u201cOh, hush!\u201d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. \u201cThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said\u2014\u201d \u201cGet to your places!\u201d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d about once in a minute. Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \u201cand then,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any one left alive!\u201d She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \u201cIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\u201d \u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with. Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s no use speaking to it,\u201d she thought, \u201ctill its ears have come, or at least one of them.\u201d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. \u201cI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201d Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u201cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u201d \u201cHow do you like the Queen?\u201d said the Cat in a low voice. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Alice: \u201cshe\u2019s so extremely\u2014\u201d Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u201c\u2014likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u201d The Queen smiled and passed on. \u201cWho _are_ you talking to?\u201d said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\u201d said Alice: \u201callow me to introduce it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u201d said the King: \u201chowever, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d the Cat remarked. \u201cDon\u2019t be impertinent,\u201d said the King, \u201cand don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u201cA cat may look at a king,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u201d \u201cWell, it must be removed,\u201d said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u201cMy dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u201d The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. \u201cOff with his head!\u201d she said, without even looking round. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u201d said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cas all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u201d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable. The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said. The executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at _his_ time of life. The King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense. The Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in less than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) Alice could think of nothing else to say but \u201cIt belongs to the Duchess: you\u2019d better ask _her_ about it.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s in prison,\u201d the Queen said to the executioner: \u201cfetch her here.\u201d And the executioner went off like an arrow. The Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle\u2019s Story \u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201d said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s, and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. \u201cWhen _I\u2019m_ a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup does very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people hot tempered,\u201d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, \u201cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes them bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn\u2019t be so stingy about it, you know\u2014\u201d She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\u2019t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u201d Alice ventured to remark. \u201cTut, tut, child!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cEverything\u2019s got a moral, if only you can find it.\u201d And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as she spoke. Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice\u2019s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. \u201cThe game\u2019s going on rather better now,\u201d she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. \u201c\u2019Tis so,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Oh, \u2019tis love, \u2019tis love, that makes the world go round!\u2019\u201d \u201cSomebody said,\u201d Alice whispered, \u201cthat it\u2019s done by everybody minding their own business!\u201d \u201cAh, well! It means much the same thing,\u201d said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice\u2019s shoulder as she added, \u201cand the moral of _that_ is\u2014\u2018Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\u2019\u201d \u201cHow fond she is of finding morals in things!\u201d Alice thought to herself. \u201cI dare say you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t put my arm round your waist,\u201d the Duchess said after a pause: \u201cthe reason is, that I\u2019m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\u201d \u201cHe might bite,\u201d Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. \u201cVery true,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cflamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.\u2019\u201d \u201cOnly mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u201d Alice remarked. \u201cRight, as usual,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cwhat a clear way you have of putting things!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a mineral, I _think_,\u201d said Alice. \u201cOf course it is,\u201d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; \u201cthere\u2019s a large mustard mine near here. And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, I know!\u201d exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \u201cit\u2019s a vegetable. It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u201d \u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Be what you would seem to be\u2019\u2014or if you\u2019d like it put more simply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\u2019\u201d \u201cI think I should understand that better,\u201d Alice said very politely, \u201cif I had it written down: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\u201d the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. \u201cPray don\u2019t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\u201d said Alice. \u201cOh, don\u2019t talk about trouble!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI make you a present of everything I\u2019ve said as yet.\u201d \u201cA cheap sort of present!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019m glad they don\u2019t give birthday presents like that!\u201d But she did not venture to say it out loud. \u201cThinking again?\u201d the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin. \u201cI\u2019ve a right to think,\u201d said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried. \u201cJust about as much right,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cas pigs have to fly; and the m\u2014\u201d But here, to Alice\u2019s great surprise, the Duchess\u2019s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word \u2018moral,\u2019 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. \u201cA fine day, your Majesty!\u201d the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. \u201cNow, I give you fair warning,\u201d shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u201ceither you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u201d The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s go on with the game,\u201d the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u201cHave you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Alice. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u201d said the Queen. \u201cI never saw one, or heard of one,\u201d said Alice. \u201cCome on, then,\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand he shall tell you his history.\u201d As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u201cYou are all pardoned.\u201d \u201cCome, _that\u2019s_ a good thing!\u201d she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u201cUp, lazy thing!\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;\u201d and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \u201cWhat fun!\u201d said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. \u201cWhat _is_ the fun?\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, _she_,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cIt\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!\u201d \u201cEverybody says \u2018come on!\u2019 here,\u201d thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u201cI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u201d They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. \u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201cIt\u2019s all his fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u201d So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. \u201cThis here young lady,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cshe wants for to know your history, she do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell it her,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \u201csit down, both of you, and don\u2019t speak a word till I\u2019ve finished.\u201d So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, \u201cI don\u2019t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn\u2019t begin.\u201d But she waited patiently. \u201cOnce,\u201d said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \u201cI was a real Turtle.\u201d These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of \u201cHjckrrh!\u201d from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \u201cThank you, sir, for your interesting story,\u201d but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. \u201cWhen we were little,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, \u201cwe went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle\u2014we used to call him Tortoise\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\u2019t one?\u201d Alice asked. \u201cWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,\u201d said the Mock Turtle angrily: \u201creally you are very dull!\u201d \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\u201d added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \u201cDrive on, old fellow! Don\u2019t be all day about it!\u201d and he went on in these words: \u201cYes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\u2019t believe it\u2014\u201d \u201cI never said I didn\u2019t!\u201d interrupted Alice. \u201cYou did,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. \u201cWe had the best of educations\u2014in fact, we went to school every day\u2014\u201d \u201c_I\u2019ve_ been to a day school, too,\u201d said Alice; \u201cyou needn\u2019t be so proud as all that.\u201d \u201cWith extras?\u201d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. \u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwe learned French and music.\u201d \u201cAnd washing?\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cCertainly not!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cAh! then yours wasn\u2019t a really good school,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. \u201cNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, \u2018French, music, _and washing_\u2014extra.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have wanted it much,\u201d said Alice; \u201cliving at the bottom of the sea.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to learn it.\u201d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. \u201cI only took the regular course.\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Alice. \u201cReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied; \u201cand then the different branches of Arithmetic\u2014Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\u201d \u201cI never heard of \u2018Uglification,\u2019\u201d Alice ventured to say. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. \u201cWhat! Never heard of uglifying!\u201d it exclaimed. \u201cYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Alice doubtfully: \u201cit means\u2014to\u2014make\u2014anything\u2014prettier.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d the Gryphon went on, \u201cif you don\u2019t know what to uglify is, you _are_ a simpleton.\u201d Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \u201cWhat else had you to learn?\u201d \u201cWell, there was Mystery,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, \u201c\u2014Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling\u2014the Drawling master was an old conger eel, that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\u201d \u201cWhat was _that_ like?\u201d said Alice. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t show it you myself,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cI\u2019m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.\u201d \u201cHadn\u2019t time,\u201d said the Gryphon: \u201cI went to the Classics master, though. He was an old crab, _he_ was.\u201d \u201cI never went to him,\u201d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \u201che taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\u201d \u201cSo he did, so he did,\u201d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. \u201cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\u201d said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. \u201cTen hours the first day,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cnine the next, and so on.\u201d \u201cWhat a curious plan!\u201d exclaimed Alice. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u201d the Gryphon remarked: \u201cbecause they lessen from day to day.\u201d This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. \u201cThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\u201d \u201cOf course it was,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\u201d Alice went on eagerly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough about lessons,\u201d the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: \u201ctell her something about the games now.\u201d CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. \u201cSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\u201d said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2014 \u201cYou may not have lived much under the sea\u2014\u201d (\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d said Alice)\u2014\u201cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2014\u201d (Alice began to say \u201cI once tasted\u2014\u201d but checked herself hastily, and said \u201cNo, never\u201d) \u201c\u2014so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhat sort of a dance is it?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cyou first form into a line along the sea shore\u2014\u201d \u201cTwo lines!\u201d cried the Mock Turtle. \u201cSeals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you\u2019ve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way\u2014\u201d \u201c_That_ generally takes some time,\u201d interrupted the Gryphon. \u201c\u2014you advance twice\u2014\u201d \u201cEach with a lobster as a partner!\u201d cried the Gryphon. \u201cOf course,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cadvance twice, set to partners\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2014change lobsters, and retire in same order,\u201d continued the Gryphon. \u201cThen, you know,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on, \u201cyou throw the\u2014\u201d \u201cThe lobsters!\u201d shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. \u201c\u2014as far out to sea as you can\u2014\u201d \u201cSwim after them!\u201d screamed the Gryphon. \u201cTurn a somersault in the sea!\u201d cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. \u201cChange lobsters again!\u201d yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice. \u201cBack to land again, and that\u2019s all the first figure,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice. \u201cIt must be a very pretty dance,\u201d said Alice timidly. \u201cWould you like to see a little of it?\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cVery much indeed,\u201d said Alice. \u201cCome, let\u2019s try the first figure!\u201d said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. \u201cWe can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\u201d \u201cOh, _you_ sing,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten the words.\u201d So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:\u2014 \u201cWill you walk a little faster?\u201d said a whiting to a snail. \u201cThere\u2019s a porpoise close behind us, and he\u2019s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle\u2014will you come and join the dance? Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance? Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance? \u201cYou can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\u201d But the snail replied \u201cToo far, too far!\u201d and gave a look askance\u2014 Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. \u201cWhat matters it how far we go?\u201d his scaly friend replied. \u201cThere is another shore, you know, upon the other side. The further off from England the nearer is to France\u2014 Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, will you join the dance? Will you, won\u2019t you, will you, won\u2019t you, won\u2019t you join the dance?\u201d \u201cThank you, it\u2019s a very interesting dance to watch,\u201d said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: \u201cand I do so like that curious song about the whiting!\u201d \u201cOh, as to the whiting,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, \u201cthey\u2014you\u2019ve seen them, of course?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI\u2019ve often seen them at dinn\u2014\u201d she checked herself hastily. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u201d said the Mock Turtle, \u201cbut if you\u2019ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u201d \u201cI believe so,\u201d Alice replied thoughtfully. \u201cThey have their tails in their mouths\u2014and they\u2019re all over crumbs.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201ccrumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths; and the reason is\u2014\u201d here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.\u2014\u201cTell her about the reason and all that,\u201d he said to the Gryphon. \u201cThe reason is,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cthat they _would_ go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Alice, \u201cit\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.\u201d \u201cI can tell you more than that, if you like,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cDo you know why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u201d \u201cI never thought about it,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201c_It does the boots and shoes_,\u201d the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \u201cDoes the boots and shoes!\u201d she repeated in a wondering tone. \u201cWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI mean, what makes them so shiny?\u201d Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. \u201cThey\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u201d \u201cBoots and shoes under the sea,\u201d the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \u201care done with a whiting. Now you know.\u201d \u201cAnd what are they made of?\u201d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. \u201cSoles and eels, of course,\u201d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u201cany shrimp could have told you that.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019d been the whiting,\u201d said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u201cI\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u2018Keep back, please: we don\u2019t want _you_ with us!\u2019\u201d \u201cThey were obliged to have him with them,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cno wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t it really?\u201d said Alice in a tone of great surprise. \u201cOf course not,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cwhy, if a fish came to _me_, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u2018With what porpoise?\u2019\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you mean \u2018purpose\u2019?\u201d said Alice. \u201cI mean what I say,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u201cCome, let\u2019s hear some of _your_ adventures.\u201d \u201cI could tell you my adventures\u2014beginning from this morning,\u201d said Alice a little timidly: \u201cbut it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u201d \u201cExplain all that,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cNo, no! The adventures first,\u201d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u201cexplanations take such a dreadful time.\u201d So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \u201c_You are old, Father William_,\u201d to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \u201cThat\u2019s very curious.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cIt all came different!\u201d the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u201cI should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\u201d He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice. \u201cStand up and repeat \u2018\u2019_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,\u2019\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cHow the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI might as well be at school at once.\u201d However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:\u2014 \u201c\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, \u201cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u201d As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u201d [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] \u201cThat\u2019s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cWell, I never heard it before,\u201d said the Mock Turtle; \u201cbut it sounds uncommon nonsense.\u201d Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again. \u201cI should like to have it explained,\u201d said the Mock Turtle. \u201cShe can\u2019t explain it,\u201d said the Gryphon hastily. \u201cGo on with the next verse.\u201d \u201cBut about his toes?\u201d the Mock Turtle persisted. \u201cHow _could_ he turn them out with his nose, you know?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the first position in dancing.\u201d Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. \u201cGo on with the next verse,\u201d the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \u201cit begins \u2018_I passed by his garden_.\u2019\u201d Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2014 \u201cI passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\u201d [later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat. When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet\u2014] \u201cWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\u201d the Mock Turtle interrupted, \u201cif you don\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\u201d \u201cYes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u201d said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so. \u201cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u201d the Gryphon went on. \u201cOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u201d \u201cOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u201d Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \u201cHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \u2018_Turtle Soup_,\u2019 will you, old fellow?\u201d The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:\u2014 \u201cBeautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Soo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! \u201cBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Soo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening, Beautiful, beauti\u2014FUL SOUP!\u201d \u201cChorus again!\u201d cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of \u201cThe trial\u2019s beginning!\u201d was heard in the distance. \u201cCome on!\u201d cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. \u201cWhat trial is it?\u201d Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered \u201cCome on!\u201d and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:\u2014 \u201cSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\u201d CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts? The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them\u2014all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\u2014\u201cI wish they\u2019d get the trial done,\u201d she thought, \u201cand hand round the refreshments!\u201d But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time. Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. \u201cThat\u2019s the judge,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cbecause of his great wig.\u201d The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the jury box,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cand those twelve creatures,\u201d (she was obliged to say \u201ccreatures,\u201d you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) \u201cI suppose they are the jurors.\u201d She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \u201cjury men\u201d would have done just as well. The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \u201cThey can\u2019t have anything to put down yet, before the trial\u2019s begun.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re putting down their names,\u201d the Gryphon whispered in reply, \u201cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\u201d \u201cStupid things!\u201d Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \u201cSilence in the court!\u201d and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \u201cstupid things!\u201d on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\u2019t know how to spell \u201cstupid,\u201d and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \u201cA nice muddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u201d thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. \u201cHerald, read the accusation!\u201d said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\u2014 \u201cThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!\u201d \u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d the King said to the jury. \u201cNot yet, not yet!\u201d the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal to come before that!\u201d \u201cCall the first witness,\u201d said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u201cFirst witness!\u201d The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other. \u201cI beg pardon, your Majesty,\u201d he began, \u201cfor bringing these in: but I hadn\u2019t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\u201d \u201cYou ought to have finished,\u201d said the King. \u201cWhen did you begin?\u201d The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the Dormouse. \u201cFourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\u201d he said. \u201cFifteenth,\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cSixteenth,\u201d added the Dormouse. \u201cWrite that down,\u201d the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. \u201cTake off your hat,\u201d the King said to the Hatter. \u201cIt isn\u2019t mine,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201c_Stolen!_\u201d the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. \u201cI keep them to sell,\u201d the Hatter added as an explanation; \u201cI\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a hatter.\u201d Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. \u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King; \u201cand don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u201d This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so,\u201d said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \u201cI can hardly breathe.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Alice very meekly: \u201cI\u2019m growing.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve no right to grow _here_,\u201d said the Dormouse. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d said Alice more boldly: \u201cyou know you\u2019re growing too.\u201d \u201cYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\u201d said the Dormouse: \u201cnot in that ridiculous fashion.\u201d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u201cBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u201d on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. \u201cGive your evidence,\u201d the King repeated angrily, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \u201c\u2014and I hadn\u2019t begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the bread and butter getting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\u201d \u201cThe twinkling of the _what?_\u201d said the King. \u201cIt _began_ with the tea,\u201d the Hatter replied. \u201cOf course twinkling begins with a T!\u201d said the King sharply. \u201cDo you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a poor man,\u201d the Hatter went on, \u201cand most things twinkled after that\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u201cYou did!\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cI deny it!\u201d said the March Hare. \u201cHe denies it,\u201d said the King: \u201cleave out that part.\u201d \u201cWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\u201d the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. \u201cAfter that,\u201d continued the Hatter, \u201cI cut some more bread and butter\u2014\u201d \u201cBut what did the Dormouse say?\u201d one of the jury asked. \u201cThat I can\u2019t remember,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cYou _must_ remember,\u201d remarked the King, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed.\u201d The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter, and went down on one knee. \u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d he began. \u201cYou\u2019re a _very_ poor _speaker_,\u201d said the King. Here one of the guinea pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea pig, head first, and then sat upon it.) \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \u201cThere was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,\u201d and I never understood what it meant till now.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u201d continued the King. \u201cI can\u2019t go no lower,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cI\u2019m on the floor, as it is.\u201d \u201cThen you may _sit_ down,\u201d the King replied. Here the other guinea pig cheered, and was suppressed. \u201cCome, that finished the guinea pigs!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cNow we shall get on better.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u201d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. \u201cYou may go,\u201d said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. \u201c\u2014and just take his head off outside,\u201d the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. \u201cCall the next witness!\u201d said the King. The next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook. She carried the pepper box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. \u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King. \u201cShan\u2019t,\u201d said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \u201cYour Majesty must cross examine _this_ witness.\u201d \u201cWell, if I must, I must,\u201d the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \u201cWhat are tarts made of?\u201d \u201cPepper, mostly,\u201d said the cook. \u201cTreacle,\u201d said a sleepy voice behind her. \u201cCollar that Dormouse,\u201d the Queen shrieked out. \u201cBehead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u201d For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \u201cNever mind!\u201d said the King, with an air of great relief. \u201cCall the next witness.\u201d And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u201cReally, my dear, _you_ must cross examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\u201d Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u201c\u2014for they haven\u2019t got much evidence _yet_,\u201d she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \u201cAlice!\u201d CHAPTER XII. Alice\u2019s Evidence \u201cHere!\u201d cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before. \u201cOh, I _beg_ your pardon!\u201d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box, or they would die. \u201cThe trial cannot proceed,\u201d said the King in a very grave voice, \u201cuntil all the jurymen are back in their proper places\u2014_all_,\u201d he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so. Alice looked at the jury box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; \u201cnot that it signifies much,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial one way up as the other.\u201d As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. \u201cWhat do you know about this business?\u201d the King said to Alice. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Alice. \u201cNothing _whatever?_\u201d persisted the King. \u201cNothing whatever,\u201d said Alice. \u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \u201c_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\u201d he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. \u201c_Un_important, of course, I meant,\u201d the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, \u201cimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014important\u2014\u201d as if he were trying which word sounded best. Some of the jury wrote it down \u201cimportant,\u201d and some \u201cunimportant.\u201d Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter a bit,\u201d she thought to herself. At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note book, cackled out \u201cSilence!\u201d and read out from his book, \u201cRule Forty two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\u201d Everybody looked at Alice. \u201c_I\u2019m_ not a mile high,\u201d said Alice. \u201cYou are,\u201d said the King. \u201cNearly two miles high,\u201d added the Queen. \u201cWell, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u201d said Alice: \u201cbesides, that\u2019s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u201d said the King. \u201cThen it ought to be Number One,\u201d said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note book hastily. \u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. \u201cThere\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\u201d said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \u201cthis paper has just been picked up.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d said the Queen. \u201cI haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u201d said the White Rabbit, \u201cbut it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to\u2014to somebody.\u201d \u201cIt must have been that,\u201d said the King, \u201cunless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t usual, you know.\u201d \u201cWho is it directed to?\u201d said one of the jurymen. \u201cIt isn\u2019t directed at all,\u201d said the White Rabbit; \u201cin fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the _outside_.\u201d He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u201cIt isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a set of verses.\u201d \u201cAre they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u201d asked another of the jurymen. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d said the White Rabbit, \u201cand that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u201d (The jury all looked puzzled.) \u201cHe must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u201d said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) \u201cPlease your Majesty,\u201d said the Knave, \u201cI didn\u2019t write it, and they can\u2019t prove I did: there\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u201d \u201cIf you didn\u2019t sign it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat only makes the matter worse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u201d There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. \u201cThat _proves_ his guilt,\u201d said the Queen. \u201cIt proves nothing of the sort!\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re about!\u201d \u201cRead them,\u201d said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u201cWhere shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u201d he asked. \u201cBegin at the beginning,\u201d the King said gravely, \u201cand go on till you come to the end: then stop.\u201d These were the verses the White Rabbit read:\u2014 \u201cThey told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it. Don\u2019t let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the most important piece of evidence we\u2019ve heard yet,\u201d said the King, rubbing his hands; \u201cso now let the jury\u2014\u201d \u201cIf any one of them can explain it,\u201d said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn\u2019t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \u201cI\u2019ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it.\u201d The jury all wrote down on their slates, \u201c_She_ doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it,\u201d but none of them attempted to explain the paper. \u201cIf there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\u2019t try to find any. And yet I don\u2019t know,\u201d he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u201cI seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \u201c\u2014_said I could not swim_\u2014\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u201d he added, turning to the Knave. The Knave shook his head sadly. \u201cDo I look like it?\u201d he said. (Which he certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.) \u201cAll right, so far,\u201d said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \u201c\u2018_We know it to be true_\u2014\u2019 that\u2019s the jury, of course\u2014\u2018_I gave her one, they gave him two_\u2014\u2019 why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know\u2014\u201d \u201cBut, it goes on \u2018_they all returned from him to you_,\u2019\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy, there they are!\u201d said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. \u201cNothing can be clearer than _that_. Then again\u2014\u2018_before she had this fit_\u2014\u2019 you never had fits, my dear, I think?\u201d he said to the Queen. \u201cNever!\u201d said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) \u201cThen the words don\u2019t _fit_ you,\u201d said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence. \u201cIt\u2019s a pun!\u201d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u201cLet the jury consider their verdict,\u201d the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. \u201cNo, no!\u201d said the Queen. \u201cSentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Alice loudly. \u201cThe idea of having the sentence first!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said the Queen, turning purple. \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d said Alice. \u201cOff with her head!\u201d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \u201cWho cares for you?\u201d said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u201d At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \u201cWake up, Alice dear!\u201d said her sister; \u201cWhy, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u201d said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u201cIt _was_ a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u201d So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:\u2014 First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers\u2014she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that _would_ always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream. The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more the pig baby was sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\u2019s slate pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard\u2014while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\u2019s heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child life, and the happy summer days.

        "Down the Rabbit Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.",
        "There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge.",
        "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.",
        "The rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.",
        "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.",
        "First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.",
        "She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cORANGE MARMALADE\u201d, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.",
        "\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down.",
        "Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \u201cI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud.",
        "\u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.",
        "Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again.",
        "\u201cI wonder if I shall fall right _through_ the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.",
        "Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d Down, down, down.",
        "There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.",
        "\u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to night, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at tea time.",
        "Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know.",
        "But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it.",
        "She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",
        "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.",
        "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.",
        "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.",
        "Suddenly she came upon a little three legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.",
        "However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.",
        "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders.",
        "Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out of the way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.",
        "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.",
        "It was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was not going to do _that_ in a hurry.",
        "\u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018_poison_\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they _would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.",
        "However, this bottle was _not_ marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart, custard, pine apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.",
        "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201d And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.",
        "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d said Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle.",
        "I wonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.",
        "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.",
        "\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.",
        "\u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable person!\u201d Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEAT ME\u201d were beautifully marked in currants.",
        "\u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which way?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.",
        "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
        "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II.",
        "The Pool of Tears \u201cCuriouser and curiouser!\u201d cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u201cnow I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good bye, feet!\u201d (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).",
        "\u201cOh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201d And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.",
        "\u201cThey must go by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look! _Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with Alice\u2019s love_).",
        "Oh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.",
        "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.",
        "\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.",
        "After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.",
        "It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.",
        "Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is to day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.",
        "I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.",
        "But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, _that\u2019s_ the great puzzle!\u201d And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, _she\u2019s_ she, and _I\u2019m_ I, and\u2014oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know.",
        "Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography.",
        "London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\u2014no, _that\u2019s_ all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018_How doth the little_\u2014\u2019\u201d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2014 \u201cHow doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale! \u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so _very_ tired of being all alone here!\u201d As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking.",
        "\u201cHow _can_ I have done that?\u201d she thought.",
        "\u201cI must be growing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.",
        "\u201cThat _was_ a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand now for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than ever,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.",
        "Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201d she said to herself.",
        "(Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.",
        "\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.",
        "\u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to day.\u201d Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.",
        "\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out of the way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she began: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2014of a mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\u201d) The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.",
        "\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cO\u00f9 est ma chatte?\u201d which was the first sentence in her French lesson book.",
        "The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.",
        "\u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings.",
        "\u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d \u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.",
        "\u201cWould _you_ like cats if you were me?\u201d \u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it.",
        "And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.",
        "She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.",
        "\u201cWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d \u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail.",
        "\u201cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always _hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation.",
        "\u201cAre you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2014oh dear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",
        "So she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.",
        "Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "A Caucus Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.",
        "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.",
        "Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than you, and must know better;\u201d and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.",
        "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I\u2019ll_ soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.",
        "Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.",
        "\u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know.",
        "Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.",
        "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2014\u2019\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver.",
        "\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.",
        "\u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse.",
        "\u201c\u2014I proceed.",
        "\u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2014\u2019\u201d \u201cFound _what_?\u201d said the Duck.",
        "\u201cFound _it_,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d \u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm.",
        "The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u2018\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown.",
        "William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate.",
        "But the insolence of his Normans\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.",
        "\u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2014\u201d \u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.",
        "\u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus race.\u201d \u201cWhat _is_ a Caucus race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.",
        "\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) First it marked out a race course, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.",
        "There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.",
        "However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.",
        "At last the Dodo said, \u201c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d \u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.",
        "\u201cWhy, _she_, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.",
        "There was exactly one a piece, all round.",
        "\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.",
        "\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely.",
        "\u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.",
        "\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.",
        "\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.",
        "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;\u201d and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.",
        "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.",
        "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.",
        "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.",
        "\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.",
        "\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.",
        "\u201cIt _is_ a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2014 \u201cFury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, \u2018Let us both go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.\u2014Come, I\u2019ll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I\u2019ve nothing to do.\u2019 Said the mouse to the cur, \u2018Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll be judge, I\u2019ll be jury,\u2019 Said cunning old Fury: \u2018I\u2019ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely.",
        "\u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d \u201cI had _not!_\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.",
        "\u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.",
        "\u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d \u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away.",
        "\u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice.",
        "\u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d The Mouse only growled in reply.",
        "\u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.",
        "\u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _your_ temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little snappishly.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d \u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d \u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory.",
        "Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat.",
        "And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.",
        "Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.",
        "\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone.",
        "\u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low spirited.",
        "In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.",
        "CHAPTER IV.",
        "The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u201cThe Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.",
        "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.",
        "\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran.",
        "\u201cHow surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW.",
        "RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it.",
        "She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.",
        "\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201d By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass.",
        "There was no label this time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.",
        "\u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does.",
        "I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.",
        "She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.",
        "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201cNow I can do no more, whatever happens.",
        "What _will_ become of me?\u201d Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.",
        "\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.",
        "I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit hole\u2014and yet\u2014and yet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what _can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more _here_.\u201d \u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I _never_ get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2014never to be an old woman\u2014but then\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like _that!_\u201d \u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself.",
        "\u201cHow can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all for any lesson books!\u201d And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.",
        "\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice.",
        "\u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs.",
        "Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.",
        "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.",
        "Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201d \u201c_That_ you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.",
        "She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame, or something of the sort.",
        "Next came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And then a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201d \u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily.",
        "\u201cHere! Come and help me out of _this!_\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d \u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d) \u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201d \u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air.",
        "This time there were _two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass.",
        "\u201cWhat a number of cucumber frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice.",
        "\u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could!_ I\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2014No, tie \u2019em together first\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2014It was Bill, I fancy\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2014Nay, _I_ shan\u2019t! _You_ do it!\u2014_That_ I won\u2019t, then!\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d \u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to herself.",
        "\u201cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I _think_ I can kick a little!\u201d She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.",
        "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then silence, and then another confusion of voices\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2014Brandy now\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201d Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought Alice,) \u201cWell, I hardly know\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack in the box, and up I goes like a sky rocket!\u201d \u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others.",
        "\u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI wonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d \u201cA barrowful of _what?_\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that again!\u201d which produced another dead silence.",
        "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.",
        "\u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make _some_ change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly.",
        "As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.",
        "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.",
        "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.",
        "\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.",
        "I think that will be the best plan.\u201d It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.",
        "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.",
        "\u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.",
        "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.",
        "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.",
        "\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2014how _is_ it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201d The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.",
        "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.",
        "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",
        "CHAPTER V.",
        "Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.",
        "\u201cWho are _you?_\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.",
        "Alice replied, rather shyly, \u201cI\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly.",
        "\u201cExplain yourself!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t explain _myself_, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely, \u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel very queer to _me_.\u201d \u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously.",
        "\u201cWho are _you?_\u201d Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.",
        "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such _very_ short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.",
        "\u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.",
        "\u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing.",
        "For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t remember _what_ things?\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u201cHow doth the little busy bee,\u201d but it all came different!\u201d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.",
        "\u201cRepeat, \u2018_You are old, Father William_,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice folded her hands, and began:\u2014 \u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said, \u201cAnd your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014 Do you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d \u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son, \u201cI feared it might injure the brain; But, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.\u201d \u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door\u2014 Pray, what is the reason of that?\u201d \u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, \u201cI kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014 Allow me to sell you a couple?\u201d \u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014 Pray, how did you manage to do it?\u201d \u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law, And argued each case with my wife; And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.\u201d \u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014 What made you so awfully clever?\u201d \u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d Said his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d \u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cNot _quite_ right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the words have got altered.\u201d \u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.",
        "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.",
        "\u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked.",
        "\u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201d \u201cI _don\u2019t_ know,\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.",
        "\u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar.",
        "\u201cWell, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d \u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",
        "\u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.",
        "And she thought of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",
        "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.",
        "In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.",
        "Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u201d \u201cOne side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\u201d thought Alice to herself.",
        "\u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",
        "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.",
        "However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",
        "\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.",
        "Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.",
        "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",
        "\u201cWhat _can_ all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cAnd where _have_ my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",
        "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.",
        "She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.",
        "\u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m _not_ a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly.",
        "\u201cLet me alone!\u201d \u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",
        "\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut I must be on the look out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.",
        "\u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m a\u2014I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d \u201cWell! _What_ are you?\u201d said the Pigeon.",
        "\u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201d \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",
        "\u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never _one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it.",
        "I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201d \u201cI _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d \u201cIt matters a good deal to _me_,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want _yours_: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d \u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.",
        "Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.",
        "After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",
        "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.",
        "\u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how _is_ that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.",
        "\u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them _this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",
        "CHAPTER VI.",
        "Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.",
        "It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.",
        "She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.",
        "The Fish Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor the Duchess.",
        "An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen.",
        "An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.",
        "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.",
        "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s no sort of use in knocking,\u201d said the Footman, \u201cand that for two reasons.",
        "First, because I\u2019m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they\u2019re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.\u201d And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary noise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.",
        "\u201cPlease, then,\u201d said Alice, \u201chow am I to get in?\u201d \u201cThere might be some sense in your knocking,\u201d the Footman went on without attending to her, \u201cif we had the door between us.",
        "For instance, if you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.\u201d He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.",
        "\u201cBut perhaps he can\u2019t help it,\u201d she said to herself; \u201chis eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his head.",
        "But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\u201d she repeated, aloud.",
        "\u201cI shall sit here,\u201d the Footman remarked, \u201ctill tomorrow\u2014\u201d At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman\u2019s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.",
        "\u201c\u2014or next day, maybe,\u201d the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.",
        "\u201cHow am I to get in?\u201d asked Alice again, in a louder tone.",
        "\u201c_Are_ you to get in at all?\u201d said the Footman.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the first question, you know.\u201d It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s really dreadful,\u201d she muttered to herself, \u201cthe way all the creatures argue.",
        "It\u2019s enough to drive one crazy!\u201d The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations.",
        "\u201cI shall sit here,\u201d he said, \u201con and off, for days and days.\u201d \u201cBut what am _I_ to do?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cAnything you like,\u201d said the Footman, and began whistling.",
        "\u201cOh, there\u2019s no use in talking to him,\u201d said Alice desperately: \u201che\u2019s perfectly idiotic!\u201d And she opened the door and went in.",
        "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u201d Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.",
        "There was certainly too much of it in the air.",
        "Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s pause.",
        "The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.",
        "\u201cPlease would you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u201cwhy your cat grins like that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cand that\u2019s why.",
        "Pig!\u201d She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\u2019t know that cats _could_ grin.\u201d \u201cThey all can,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand most of \u2019em do.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know of any that do,\u201d Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.",
        "\u201cYou don\u2019t know much,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand that\u2019s a fact.\u201d Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.",
        "While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.",
        "The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.",
        "\u201cOh, _please_ mind what you\u2019re doing!\u201d cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror.",
        "\u201cOh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\u201d as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.",
        "\u201cIf everybody minded their own business,\u201d the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, \u201cthe world would go round a deal faster than it does.\u201d \u201cWhich would _not_ be an advantage,\u201d said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.",
        "\u201cJust think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\u201d \u201cTalking of axes,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cchop off her head!\u201d Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: \u201cTwenty four hours, I _think_; or is it twelve? I\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t bother _me_,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cI never could abide figures!\u201d And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: \u201cSpeak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.\u201d CHORUS.",
        "(In which the cook and the baby joined): \u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014 \u201cI speak severely to my boy, I beat him when he sneezes; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases!\u201d CHORUS.",
        "\u201cWow! wow! wow!\u201d \u201cHere! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\u201d the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.",
        "\u201cI must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,\u201d and she hurried out of the room.",
        "The cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.",
        "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, \u201cjust like a star fish,\u201d thought Alice.",
        "The poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.",
        "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.",
        "\u201cIf I don\u2019t take this child away with me,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cthey\u2019re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn\u2019t it be murder to leave it behind?\u201d She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t grunt,\u201d said Alice; \u201cthat\u2019s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.\u201d The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it.",
        "There could be no doubt that it had a _very_ turn up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.",
        "\u201cBut perhaps it was only sobbing,\u201d she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.",
        "No, there were no tears.",
        "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u201d said Alice, seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you.",
        "Mind now!\u201d The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.",
        "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201cNow, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?\u201d when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.",
        "This time there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.",
        "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood.",
        "\u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.",
        "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.",
        "It looked good natured, she thought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
        "\u201cCheshire Puss,\u201d she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.",
        "\u201cCome, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u201d thought Alice, and she went on.",
        "\u201cWould you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u201d \u201cThat depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u201d said the Cat.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t much care where\u2014\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u201d said the Cat.",
        "\u201c\u2014so long as I get _somewhere_,\u201d Alice added as an explanation.",
        "\u201cOh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cif you only walk long enough.\u201d Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.",
        "\u201cWhat sort of people live about here?\u201d \u201cIn _that_ direction,\u201d the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u201clives a Hatter: and in _that_ direction,\u201d waving the other paw, \u201clives a March Hare.",
        "Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u201d Alice remarked.",
        "\u201cOh, you can\u2019t help that,\u201d said the Cat: \u201cwe\u2019re all mad here.",
        "I\u2019m mad.",
        "You\u2019re mad.\u201d \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m mad?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cYou must be,\u201d said the Cat, \u201cor you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u201cAnd how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u201d \u201cTo begin with,\u201d said the Cat, \u201ca dog\u2019s not mad.",
        "You grant that?\u201d \u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cWell, then,\u201d the Cat went on, \u201cyou see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased.",
        "Now _I_ growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry.",
        "Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u201d \u201c_I_ call it purring, not growling,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cCall it what you like,\u201d said the Cat.",
        "\u201cDo you play croquet with the Queen to day?\u201d \u201cI should like it very much,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see me there,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished.",
        "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening.",
        "While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.",
        "\u201cBy the bye, what became of the baby?\u201d said the Cat.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u201d \u201cIt turned into a pig,\u201d Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.",
        "\u201cI thought it would,\u201d said the Cat, and vanished again.",
        "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cthe March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it was in March.\u201d As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.",
        "\u201cDid you say pig, or fig?\u201d said the Cat.",
        "\u201cI said pig,\u201d replied Alice; \u201cand I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.",
        "\u201cWell! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cbut a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u201d She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.",
        "It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201d CHAPTER VII.",
        "A Mad Tea Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.",
        "\u201cVery uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u201cNo room! No room!\u201d they cried out when they saw Alice coming.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s _plenty_ of room!\u201d said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table.",
        "\u201cHave some wine,\u201d the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.",
        "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t see any wine,\u201d she remarked.",
        "\u201cThere isn\u2019t any,\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "\u201cThen it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u201d said Alice angrily.",
        "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was _your_ table,\u201d said Alice; \u201cit\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u201d \u201cYour hair wants cutting,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.",
        "\u201cYou should learn not to make personal remarks,\u201d Alice said with some severity; \u201cit\u2019s very rude.\u201d The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_ was, \u201cWhy is a raven like a writing desk?\u201d \u201cCome, we shall have some fun now!\u201d thought Alice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019ve begun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\u201d she added aloud.",
        "\u201cDo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "\u201cExactly so,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cThen you should say what you mean,\u201d the March Hare went on.",
        "\u201cI do,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201cat least\u2014at least I mean what I say\u2014that\u2019s the same thing, you know.\u201d \u201cNot the same thing a bit!\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "\u201cYou might just as well say that \u2018I see what I eat\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I eat what I see\u2019!\u201d \u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the March Hare, \u201cthat \u2018I like what I get\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I get what I like\u2019!\u201d \u201cYou might just as well say,\u201d added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \u201cthat \u2018I breathe when I sleep\u2019 is the same thing as \u2018I sleep when I breathe\u2019!\u201d \u201cIt _is_ the same thing with you,\u201d said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks, which wasn\u2019t much.",
        "The Hatter was the first to break the silence.",
        "\u201cWhat day of the month is it?\u201d he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.",
        "Alice considered a little, and then said \u201cThe fourth.\u201d \u201cTwo days wrong!\u201d sighed the Hatter.",
        "\u201cI told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u201d he added looking angrily at the March Hare.",
        "\u201cIt was the _best_ butter,\u201d the March Hare meekly replied.",
        "\u201cYes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u201d the Hatter grumbled: \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread knife.\u201d The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u201cIt was the _best_ butter, you know.\u201d Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.",
        "\u201cWhat a funny watch!\u201d she remarked.",
        "\u201cIt tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u201d \u201cWhy should it?\u201d muttered the Hatter.",
        "\u201cDoes _your_ watch tell you what year it is?\u201d \u201cOf course not,\u201d Alice replied very readily: \u201cbut that\u2019s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\u201d \u201cWhich is just the case with _mine_,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand you,\u201d she said, as politely as she could.",
        "\u201cThe Dormouse is asleep again,\u201d said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.",
        "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u201cOf course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u201d \u201cHave you guessed the riddle yet?\u201d the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.",
        "\u201cNo, I give it up,\u201d Alice replied: \u201cwhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "\u201cNor I,\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "Alice sighed wearily.",
        "\u201cI think you might do something better with the time,\u201d she said, \u201cthan waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u201d \u201cIf you knew Time as well as I do,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting _it_.",
        "It\u2019s _him_.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.",
        "\u201cI dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u201d \u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Alice cautiously replied: \u201cbut I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\u201d \u201cAh! that accounts for it,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "\u201cHe won\u2019t stand beating.",
        "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock.",
        "For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half past one, time for dinner!\u201d (\u201cI only wish it was,\u201d the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) \u201cThat would be grand, certainly,\u201d said Alice thoughtfully: \u201cbut then\u2014I shouldn\u2019t be hungry for it, you know.\u201d \u201cNot at first, perhaps,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cbut you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked.\u201d \u201cIs that the way _you_ manage?\u201d Alice asked.",
        "The Hatter shook his head mournfully.",
        "\u201cNot I!\u201d he replied.",
        "\u201cWe quarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\u201d (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u201c\u2014it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing \u2018Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! How I wonder what you\u2019re at!\u2019 You know the song, perhaps?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard something like it,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cIt goes on, you know,\u201d the Hatter continued, \u201cin this way:\u2014 \u2018Up above the world you fly, Like a tea tray in the sky.",
        "Twinkle, twinkle\u2014\u2019\u201d Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep \u201c_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\u201d and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.",
        "\u201cWell, I\u2019d hardly finished the first verse,\u201d said the Hatter, \u201cwhen the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \u2018He\u2019s murdering the time! Off with his head!\u2019\u201d \u201cHow dreadfully savage!\u201d exclaimed Alice.",
        "\u201cAnd ever since that,\u201d the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \u201che won\u2019t do a thing I ask! It\u2019s always six o\u2019clock now.\u201d A bright idea came into Alice\u2019s head.",
        "\u201cIs that the reason so many tea things are put out here?\u201d she asked.",
        "\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said the Hatter with a sigh: \u201cit\u2019s always tea time, and we\u2019ve no time to wash the things between whiles.\u201d \u201cThen you keep moving round, I suppose?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cExactly so,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cas the things get used up.\u201d \u201cBut what happens when you come to the beginning again?\u201d Alice ventured to ask.",
        "\u201cSuppose we change the subject,\u201d the March Hare interrupted, yawning.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this.",
        "I vote the young lady tells us a story.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know one,\u201d said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.",
        "\u201cThen the Dormouse shall!\u201d they both cried.",
        "\u201cWake up, Dormouse!\u201d And they pinched it on both sides at once.",
        "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.",
        "\u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201d he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \u201cI heard every word you fellows were saying.\u201d \u201cTell us a story!\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "\u201cYes, please do!\u201d pleaded Alice.",
        "\u201cAnd be quick about it,\u201d added the Hatter, \u201cor you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u201d \u201cOnce upon a time there were three little sisters,\u201d the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u201cand their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat did they live on?\u201d said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.",
        "\u201cThey lived on treacle,\u201d said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.",
        "\u201cThey couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u201d Alice gently remarked; \u201cthey\u2019d have been ill.\u201d \u201cSo they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c_very_ ill.\u201d Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u201cBut why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d \u201cTake some more tea,\u201d the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u201d Alice replied in an offended tone, \u201cso I can\u2019t take more.\u201d \u201cYou mean you can\u2019t take _less_,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cit\u2019s very easy to take _more_ than nothing.\u201d \u201cNobody asked _your_ opinion,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u201d the Hatter asked triumphantly.",
        "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.",
        "\u201cWhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\u201d The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u201cIt was a treacle well.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing!\u201d Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u201cSh! sh!\u201d and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u201cIf you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u201d \u201cNo, please go on!\u201d Alice said very humbly; \u201cI won\u2019t interrupt again.",
        "I dare say there may be _one_.\u201d \u201cOne, indeed!\u201d said the Dormouse indignantly.",

        "\u201cOf course they were,\u201d said the Dormouse; \u201c\u2014well in.\u201d This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.",

        "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: \u201c\u2014that begins with an M, such as mouse traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say things are \u201cmuch of a muchness\u201d\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?\u201d \u201cReally, now you ask me,\u201d said Alice, very much confused, \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t talk,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.",
        "\u201cAt any rate I\u2019ll never go _there_ again!\u201d said Alice as she picked her way through the wood.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the stupidest tea party I ever was at in all my life!\u201d Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s very curious!\u201d she thought.",
        "\u201cBut everything\u2019s curious today.",
        "I think I may as well go in at once.\u201d And in she went.",
        "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table.",
        "\u201cNow, I\u2019ll manage better this time,\u201d she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.",
        "Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_\u2014she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains.",
        "CHAPTER VIII.",
        "The Queen\u2019s Croquet Ground A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.",
        "Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me like that!\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it,\u201d said Five, in a sulky tone; \u201cSeven jogged my elbow.\u201d On which Seven looked up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!\u201d \u201c_You\u2019d_ better not talk!\u201d said Five.",
        "\u201cI heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d said the one who had spoken first.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s none of _your_ business, Two!\u201d said Seven.",
        "\u201cYes, it _is_ his business!\u201d said Five, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell him\u2014it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions.\u201d Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun \u201cWell, of all the unjust things\u2014\u201d when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.",
        "\u201cWould you tell me,\u201d said Alice, a little timidly, \u201cwhy you are painting those roses?\u201d Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.",
        "Two began in a low voice, \u201cWhy the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a _red_ rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.",
        "So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\u201d At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u201cThe Queen! The Queen!\u201d and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.",
        "There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.",
        "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.",
        "After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.",
        "Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her.",
        "Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.",
        "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u201cand besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u201d thought she, \u201cif people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u201d So she stood still where she was, and waited.",
        "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \u201cWho is this?\u201d She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",
        "\u201cIdiot!\u201d said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, child?\u201d \u201cMy name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u201d said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \u201cWhy, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all.",
        "I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u201d \u201cAnd who are _these?_\u201d said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.",
        "\u201cHow should _I_ know?\u201d said Alice, surprised at her own courage.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no business of _mine_.\u201d The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \u201cOff with her head! Off\u2014\u201d \u201cNonsense!\u201d said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.",
        "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u201cConsider, my dear: she is only a child!\u201d The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u201cTurn them over!\u201d The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.",
        "\u201cGet up!\u201d said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.",
        "\u201cLeave off that!\u201d screamed the Queen.",
        "\u201cYou make me giddy.\u201d And then, turning to the rose tree, she went on, \u201cWhat _have_ you been doing here?\u201d \u201cMay it please your Majesty,\u201d said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u201cwe were trying\u2014\u201d \u201c_I_ see!\u201d said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.",
        "\u201cOff with their heads!\u201d and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.",
        "\u201cYou shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u201d said Alice, and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near.",
        "The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.",
        "\u201cAre their heads off?\u201d shouted the Queen.",
        "\u201cTheir heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u201d the soldiers shouted in reply.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d shouted the Queen.",
        "\u201cCan you play croquet?\u201d The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.",
        "\u201cYes!\u201d shouted Alice.",
        "\u201cCome on, then!\u201d roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s a very fine day!\u201d said a timid voice at her side.",
        "She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",
        "\u201cVery,\u201d said Alice: \u201c\u2014where\u2019s the Duchess?\u201d \u201cHush! Hush!\u201d said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.",
        "He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \u201cShe\u2019s under sentence of execution.\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cDid you say \u2018What a pity!\u2019?\u201d the Rabbit asked.",
        "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Alice: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all a pity.",
        "I said \u2018What for?\u2019\u201d \u201cShe boxed the Queen\u2019s ears\u2014\u201d the Rabbit began.",
        "Alice gave a little scream of laughter.",
        "\u201cOh, hush!\u201d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone.",
        "\u201cThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said\u2014\u201d \u201cGet to your places!\u201d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.",
        "Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
        "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.",
        "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d about once in a minute.",
        "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \u201cand then,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhat would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any one left alive!\u201d She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \u201cIt\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\u201d \u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.",
        "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no use speaking to it,\u201d she thought, \u201ctill its ears have come, or at least one of them.\u201d In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.",
        "The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201d Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u201cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u201d \u201cHow do you like the Queen?\u201d said the Cat in a low voice.",
        "\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Alice: \u201cshe\u2019s so extremely\u2014\u201d Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u201c\u2014likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u201d The Queen smiled and passed on.",
        "\u201cWho _are_ you talking to?\u201d said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\u201d said Alice: \u201callow me to introduce it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u201d said the King: \u201chowever, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d the Cat remarked.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t be impertinent,\u201d said the King, \u201cand don\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d He got behind Alice as he spoke.",
        "\u201cA cat may look at a king,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u201d \u201cWell, it must be removed,\u201d said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u201cMy dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u201d The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.",
        "\u201cOff with his head!\u201d she said, without even looking round.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u201d said the King eagerly, and he hurried off.",
        "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion.",
        "She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.",
        "So she went in search of her hedgehog.",
        "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.",
        "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cas all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u201d So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.",
        "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.",
        "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.",
        "The executioner\u2019s argument was, that you couldn\u2019t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn\u2019t going to begin at _his_ time of life.",
        "The King\u2019s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren\u2019t to talk nonsense.",
        "The Queen\u2019s argument was, that if something wasn\u2019t done about it in less than no time she\u2019d have everybody executed, all round.",
        "(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.) Alice could think of nothing else to say but \u201cIt belongs to the Duchess: you\u2019d better ask _her_ about it.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s in prison,\u201d the Queen said to the executioner: \u201cfetch her here.\u201d And the executioner went off like an arrow.",
        "The Cat\u2019s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.",
        "CHAPTER IX.",
        "The Mock Turtle\u2019s Story \u201cYou can\u2019t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!\u201d said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice\u2019s, and they walked off together.",
        "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.",
        "\u201cWhen _I\u2019m_ a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_.",
        "Soup does very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people hot tempered,\u201d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, \u201cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes them bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered.",
        "I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn\u2019t be so stingy about it, you know\u2014\u201d She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.",
        "I can\u2019t tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u201d Alice ventured to remark.",
        "\u201cTut, tut, child!\u201d said the Duchess.",
        "\u201cEverything\u2019s got a moral, if only you can find it.\u201d And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as she spoke.",
        "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice\u2019s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.",
        "However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.",
        "\u201cThe game\u2019s going on rather better now,\u201d she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little.",
        "\u201c\u2019Tis so,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Oh, \u2019tis love, \u2019tis love, that makes the world go round!\u2019\u201d \u201cSomebody said,\u201d Alice whispered, \u201cthat it\u2019s done by everybody minding their own business!\u201d \u201cAh, well! It means much the same thing,\u201d said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into Alice\u2019s shoulder as she added, \u201cand the moral of _that_ is\u2014\u2018Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.\u2019\u201d \u201cHow fond she is of finding morals in things!\u201d Alice thought to herself.",
        "\u201cI dare say you\u2019re wondering why I don\u2019t put my arm round your waist,\u201d the Duchess said after a pause: \u201cthe reason is, that I\u2019m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.",
        "Shall I try the experiment?\u201d \u201cHe might bite,\u201d Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.",
        "\u201cVery true,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cflamingoes and mustard both bite.",
        "And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.\u2019\u201d \u201cOnly mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u201d Alice remarked.",
        "\u201cRight, as usual,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cwhat a clear way you have of putting things!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a mineral, I _think_,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cOf course it is,\u201d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; \u201cthere\u2019s a large mustard mine near here.",
        "And the moral of that is\u2014\u2018The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, I know!\u201d exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, \u201cit\u2019s a vegetable.",
        "It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u201d \u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand the moral of that is\u2014\u2018Be what you would seem to be\u2019\u2014or if you\u2019d like it put more simply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\u2019\u201d \u201cI think I should understand that better,\u201d Alice said very politely, \u201cif I had it written down: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to what I could say if I chose,\u201d the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.",
        "\u201cPray don\u2019t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cOh, don\u2019t talk about trouble!\u201d said the Duchess.",
        "\u201cI make you a present of everything I\u2019ve said as yet.\u201d \u201cA cheap sort of present!\u201d thought Alice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m glad they don\u2019t give birthday presents like that!\u201d But she did not venture to say it out loud.",
        "\u201cThinking again?\u201d the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp little chin.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve a right to think,\u201d said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.",
        "\u201cJust about as much right,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cas pigs have to fly; and the m\u2014\u201d But here, to Alice\u2019s great surprise, the Duchess\u2019s voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word \u2018moral,\u2019 and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.",
        "Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.",
        "\u201cA fine day, your Majesty!\u201d the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.",
        "\u201cNow, I give you fair warning,\u201d shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u201ceither you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u201d The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.",
        "\u201cLet\u2019s go on with the game,\u201d the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground.",
        "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives.",
        "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u201cOff with his head!\u201d or \u201cOff with her head!\u201d Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.",
        "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u201cHave you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u201d said the Queen.",
        "\u201cI never saw one, or heard of one,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cCome on, then,\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand he shall tell you his history.\u201d As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u201cYou are all pardoned.\u201d \u201cCome, _that\u2019s_ a good thing!\u201d she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.",
        "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.",
        "(If you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u201cUp, lazy thing!\u201d said the Queen, \u201cand take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.",
        "I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;\u201d and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.",
        "Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.",
        "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled.",
        "\u201cWhat fun!\u201d said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.",
        "\u201cWhat _is_ the fun?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cWhy, _she_,\u201d said the Gryphon.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.",
        "Come on!\u201d \u201cEverybody says \u2018come on!\u2019 here,\u201d thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u201cI never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u201d They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.",
        "She pitied him deeply.",
        "\u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201cIt\u2019s all his fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know.",
        "Come on!\u201d So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.",
        "\u201cThis here young lady,\u201d said the Gryphon, \u201cshe wants for to know your history, she do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell it her,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: \u201csit down, both of you, and don\u2019t speak a word till I\u2019ve finished.\u201d So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.",
        "Alice thought to herself, \u201cI don\u2019t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn\u2019t begin.\u201d But she waited patiently.",
        "\u201cOnce,\u201d said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, \u201cI was a real Turtle.\u201d These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of \u201cHjckrrh!\u201d from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.",
        "Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, \u201cThank you, sir, for your interesting story,\u201d but she could not help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.",
        "\u201cWhen we were little,\u201d the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, \u201cwe went to school in the sea.",
        "The master was an old Turtle\u2014we used to call him Tortoise\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn\u2019t one?\u201d Alice asked.",
        "\u201cWe called him Tortoise because he taught us,\u201d said the Mock Turtle angrily: \u201creally you are very dull!\u201d \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,\u201d added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.",
        "At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, \u201cDrive on, old fellow! Don\u2019t be all day about it!\u201d and he went on in these words: \u201cYes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn\u2019t believe it\u2014\u201d \u201cI never said I didn\u2019t!\u201d interrupted Alice.",
        "\u201cYou did,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.",
        "\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.",
        "The Mock Turtle went on.",
        "\u201cWe had the best of educations\u2014in fact, we went to school every day\u2014\u201d \u201c_I\u2019ve_ been to a day school, too,\u201d said Alice; \u201cyou needn\u2019t be so proud as all that.\u201d \u201cWith extras?\u201d asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwe learned French and music.\u201d \u201cAnd washing?\u201d said the Mock Turtle.",
        "\u201cCertainly not!\u201d said Alice indignantly.",
        "\u201cAh! then yours wasn\u2019t a really good school,\u201d said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief.",
        "\u201cNow at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill, \u2018French, music, _and washing_\u2014extra.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have wanted it much,\u201d said Alice; \u201cliving at the bottom of the sea.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to learn it.\u201d said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.",
        "\u201cI only took the regular course.\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d inquired Alice.",
        "\u201cReeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied; \u201cand then the different branches of Arithmetic\u2014Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.\u201d \u201cI never heard of \u2018Uglification,\u2019\u201d Alice ventured to say.",
        "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.",
        "\u201cWhat! Never heard of uglifying!\u201d it exclaimed.",
        "\u201cYou know what to beautify is, I suppose?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Alice doubtfully: \u201cit means\u2014to\u2014make\u2014anything\u2014prettier.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d the Gryphon went on, \u201cif you don\u2019t know what to uglify is, you _are_ a simpleton.\u201d Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said \u201cWhat else had you to learn?\u201d \u201cWell, there was Mystery,\u201d the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, \u201c\u2014Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling\u2014the Drawling master was an old conger eel, that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.\u201d \u201cWhat was _that_ like?\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cWell, I can\u2019t show it you myself,\u201d the Mock Turtle said: \u201cI\u2019m too stiff.",
        "And the Gryphon never learnt it.\u201d \u201cHadn\u2019t time,\u201d said the Gryphon: \u201cI went to the Classics master, though.",
        "He was an old crab, _he_ was.\u201d \u201cI never went to him,\u201d the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \u201che taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.\u201d \u201cSo he did, so he did,\u201d said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.",
        "\u201cAnd how many hours a day did you do lessons?\u201d said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.",
        "\u201cTen hours the first day,\u201d said the Mock Turtle: \u201cnine the next, and so on.\u201d \u201cWhat a curious plan!\u201d exclaimed Alice.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the reason they\u2019re called lessons,\u201d the Gryphon remarked: \u201cbecause they lessen from day to day.\u201d This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark.",
        "\u201cThen the eleventh day must have been a holiday?\u201d \u201cOf course it was,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.",
        "\u201cAnd how did you manage on the twelfth?\u201d Alice went on eagerly.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s enough about lessons,\u201d the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: \u201ctell her something about the games now.\u201d CHAPTER X.",
        "The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes.",
        "He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice.",
        "\u201cSame as if he had a bone in his throat,\u201d said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.",
        "At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on again:\u2014 \u201cYou may not have lived much under the sea\u2014\u201d (\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d said Alice)\u2014\u201cand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster\u2014\u201d (Alice began to say \u201cI once tasted\u2014\u201d but checked herself hastily, and said \u201cNo, never\u201d) \u201c\u2014so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d said Alice.",

        "When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet\u2014] \u201cWhat _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\u201d the Mock Turtle interrupted, \u201cif you don\u2019t explain it as you go on? It\u2019s by far the most confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\u201d \u201cYes, I think you\u2019d better leave off,\u201d said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.",
        "\u201cShall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?\u201d the Gryphon went on.",
        "\u201cOr would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?\u201d \u201cOh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,\u201d Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, \u201cHm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her \u2018_Turtle Soup_,\u2019 will you, old fellow?\u201d The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:\u2014 \u201cBeautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen! Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Soo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! \u201cBeautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish? Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Beau\u2014ootiful Soo\u2014oop! Soo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening, Beautiful, beauti\u2014FUL SOUP!\u201d \u201cChorus again!\u201d cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of \u201cThe trial\u2019s beginning!\u201d was heard in the distance.",
        "\u201cCome on!\u201d cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.",
        "\u201cWhat trial is it?\u201d Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered \u201cCome on!\u201d and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:\u2014 \u201cSoo\u2014oop of the e\u2014e\u2014evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\u201d CHAPTER XI.",
        "Who Stole the Tarts? The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them\u2014all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.",
        "In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\u2014\u201cI wish they\u2019d get the trial done,\u201d she thought, \u201cand hand round the refreshments!\u201d But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.",
        "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s the judge,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cbecause of his great wig.\u201d The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.",
        "\u201cAnd that\u2019s the jury box,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cand those twelve creatures,\u201d (she was obliged to say \u201ccreatures,\u201d you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) \u201cI suppose they are the jurors.\u201d She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all.",
        "However, \u201cjury men\u201d would have done just as well.",
        "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.",
        "\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d Alice whispered to the Gryphon.",
        "\u201cThey can\u2019t have anything to put down yet, before the trial\u2019s begun.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re putting down their names,\u201d the Gryphon whispered in reply, \u201cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\u201d \u201cStupid things!\u201d Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \u201cSilence in the court!\u201d and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.",
        "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \u201cstupid things!\u201d on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\u2019t know how to spell \u201cstupid,\u201d and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.",
        "\u201cA nice muddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u201d thought Alice.",
        "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.",
        "This of course, Alice could _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.",
        "She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.",
        "\u201cHerald, read the accusation!\u201d said the King.",
        "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:\u2014 \u201cThe Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!\u201d \u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d the King said to the jury.",
        "\u201cNot yet, not yet!\u201d the Rabbit hastily interrupted.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal to come before that!\u201d \u201cCall the first witness,\u201d said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u201cFirst witness!\u201d The first witness was the Hatter.",
        "He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other.",
        "\u201cI beg pardon, your Majesty,\u201d he began, \u201cfor bringing these in: but I hadn\u2019t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\u201d \u201cYou ought to have finished,\u201d said the King.",
        "\u201cWhen did you begin?\u201d The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm in arm with the Dormouse.",
        "\u201cFourteenth of March, I _think_ it was,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cFifteenth,\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "\u201cSixteenth,\u201d added the Dormouse.",
        "\u201cWrite that down,\u201d the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.",
        "\u201cTake off your hat,\u201d the King said to the Hatter.",
        "\u201cIt isn\u2019t mine,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "\u201c_Stolen!_\u201d the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.",
        "\u201cI keep them to sell,\u201d the Hatter added as an explanation; \u201cI\u2019ve none of my own.",
        "I\u2019m a hatter.\u201d Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.",
        "\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King; \u201cand don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u201d This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter.",
        "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.",
        "\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so,\u201d said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her.",
        "\u201cI can hardly breathe.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Alice very meekly: \u201cI\u2019m growing.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve no right to grow _here_,\u201d said the Dormouse.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d said Alice more boldly: \u201cyou know you\u2019re growing too.\u201d \u201cYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\u201d said the Dormouse: \u201cnot in that ridiculous fashion.\u201d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.",
        "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u201cBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u201d on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.",
        "\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d the King repeated angrily, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \u201c\u2014and I hadn\u2019t begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the bread and butter getting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\u201d \u201cThe twinkling of the _what?_\u201d said the King.",
        "\u201cIt _began_ with the tea,\u201d the Hatter replied.",
        "\u201cOf course twinkling begins with a T!\u201d said the King sharply.",
        "\u201cDo you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a poor man,\u201d the Hatter went on, \u201cand most things twinkled after that\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.",
        "\u201cYou did!\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "\u201cI deny it!\u201d said the March Hare.",
        "\u201cHe denies it,\u201d said the King: \u201cleave out that part.\u201d \u201cWell, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\u201d the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.",
        "\u201cAfter that,\u201d continued the Hatter, \u201cI cut some more bread and butter\u2014\u201d \u201cBut what did the Dormouse say?\u201d one of the jury asked.",
        "\u201cThat I can\u2019t remember,\u201d said the Hatter.",
        "\u201cYou _must_ remember,\u201d remarked the King, \u201cor I\u2019ll have you executed.\u201d The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter, and went down on one knee.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u201d he began.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re a _very_ poor _speaker_,\u201d said the King.",
        "Here one of the guinea pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.",
        "(As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.",
        "They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea pig, head first, and then sat upon it.) \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u201d thought Alice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \u201cThere was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,\u201d and I never understood what it meant till now.\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u201d continued the King.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t go no lower,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cI\u2019m on the floor, as it is.\u201d \u201cThen you may _sit_ down,\u201d the King replied.",
        "Here the other guinea pig cheered, and was suppressed.",
        "\u201cCome, that finished the guinea pigs!\u201d thought Alice.",
        "\u201cNow we shall get on better.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u201d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",
        "\u201cYou may go,\u201d said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.",
        "\u201c\u2014and just take his head off outside,\u201d the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.",
        "\u201cCall the next witness!\u201d said the King.",
        "The next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook.",
        "She carried the pepper box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.",
        "\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King.",
        "\u201cShan\u2019t,\u201d said the cook.",
        "The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \u201cYour Majesty must cross examine _this_ witness.\u201d \u201cWell, if I must, I must,\u201d the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \u201cWhat are tarts made of?\u201d \u201cPepper, mostly,\u201d said the cook.",
        "\u201cTreacle,\u201d said a sleepy voice behind her.",
        "\u201cCollar that Dormouse,\u201d the Queen shrieked out.",
        "\u201cBehead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u201d For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.",
        "\u201cNever mind!\u201d said the King, with an air of great relief.",
        "\u201cCall the next witness.\u201d And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u201cReally, my dear, _you_ must cross examine the next witness.",
        "It quite makes my forehead ache!\u201d Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u201c\u2014for they haven\u2019t got much evidence _yet_,\u201d she said to herself.",
        "Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \u201cAlice!\u201d CHAPTER XII.",
        "Alice\u2019s Evidence \u201cHere!\u201d cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",
        "\u201cOh, I _beg_ your pardon!\u201d she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box, or they would die.",
        "\u201cThe trial cannot proceed,\u201d said the King in a very grave voice, \u201cuntil all the jurymen are back in their proper places\u2014_all_,\u201d he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.",
        "Alice looked at the jury box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.",
        "She soon got it out again, and put it right; \u201cnot that it signifies much,\u201d she said to herself; \u201cI should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the trial one way up as the other.\u201d As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.",
        "\u201cWhat do you know about this business?\u201d the King said to Alice.",
        "\u201cNothing,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cNothing _whatever?_\u201d persisted the King.",
        "\u201cNothing whatever,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s very important,\u201d the King said, turning to the jury.",
        "They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: \u201c_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\u201d he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.",
        "\u201c_Un_important, of course, I meant,\u201d the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, \u201cimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014important\u2014\u201d as if he were trying which word sounded best.",
        "Some of the jury wrote it down \u201cimportant,\u201d and some \u201cunimportant.\u201d Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter a bit,\u201d she thought to herself.",
        "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note book, cackled out \u201cSilence!\u201d and read out from his book, \u201cRule Forty two.",
        "_All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\u201d Everybody looked at Alice.",
        "\u201c_I\u2019m_ not a mile high,\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cYou are,\u201d said the King.",
        "\u201cNearly two miles high,\u201d added the Queen.",
        "\u201cWell, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u201d said Alice: \u201cbesides, that\u2019s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u201d said the King.",
        "\u201cThen it ought to be Number One,\u201d said Alice.",
        "The King turned pale, and shut his note book hastily.",
        "\u201cConsider your verdict,\u201d he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\u201d said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \u201cthis paper has just been picked up.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d said the Queen.",
        "\u201cI haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u201d said the White Rabbit, \u201cbut it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to\u2014to somebody.\u201d \u201cIt must have been that,\u201d said the King, \u201cunless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t usual, you know.\u201d \u201cWho is it directed to?\u201d said one of the jurymen.",
        "\u201cIt isn\u2019t directed at all,\u201d said the White Rabbit; \u201cin fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the _outside_.\u201d He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u201cIt isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a set of verses.\u201d \u201cAre they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u201d asked another of the jurymen.",
        "\u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d said the White Rabbit, \u201cand that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u201d (The jury all looked puzzled.) \u201cHe must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u201d said the King.",
        "(The jury all brightened up again.) \u201cPlease your Majesty,\u201d said the Knave, \u201cI didn\u2019t write it, and they can\u2019t prove I did: there\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u201d \u201cIf you didn\u2019t sign it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat only makes the matter worse.",
        "You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u201d There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day.",

        "\u201cWhere shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cBegin at the beginning,\u201d the King said gravely, \u201cand go on till you come to the end: then stop.\u201d These were the verses the White Rabbit read:\u2014 \u201cThey told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim.",
        "He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before.",

        "\u201cIf there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u201d said the King, \u201cthat saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\u2019t try to find any.",
        "And yet I don\u2019t know,\u201d he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u201cI seem to see some meaning in them, after all.",
        "\u201c\u2014_said I could not swim_\u2014\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u201d he added, turning to the Knave.",
        "The Knave shook his head sadly.",
        "\u201cDo I look like it?\u201d he said.",
        "(Which he certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.) \u201cAll right, so far,\u201d said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \u201c\u2018_We know it to be true_\u2014\u2019 that\u2019s the jury, of course\u2014\u2018_I gave her one, they gave him two_\u2014\u2019 why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know\u2014\u201d \u201cBut, it goes on \u2018_they all returned from him to you_,\u2019\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cWhy, there they are!\u201d said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table.",
        "\u201cNothing can be clearer than _that_.",
        "Then again\u2014\u2018_before she had this fit_\u2014\u2019 you never had fits, my dear, I think?\u201d he said to the Queen.",
        "\u201cNever!\u201d said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke.",
        "(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) \u201cThen the words don\u2019t _fit_ you,\u201d said the King, looking round the court with a smile.",
        "There was a dead silence.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a pun!\u201d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u201cLet the jury consider their verdict,\u201d the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.",
        "\u201cNo, no!\u201d said the Queen.",
        "\u201cSentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u201d \u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Alice loudly.",
        "\u201cThe idea of having the sentence first!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said the Queen, turning purple.",
        "\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d said Alice.",
        "\u201cOff with her head!\u201d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.",
        "Nobody moved.",
        "\u201cWho cares for you?\u201d said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u201d At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",
        "\u201cWake up, Alice dear!\u201d said her sister; \u201cWhy, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u201d said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u201cIt _was_ a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u201d So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.",
        "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:\u2014 First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers\u2014she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that _would_ always get into her eyes\u2014and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.",
        "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by\u2014the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool\u2014she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution\u2014once more the pig baby was sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it\u2014once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\u2019s slate pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.",
        "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard\u2014while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\u2019s heavy sobs.",
        "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child life, and the happy summer days.",
