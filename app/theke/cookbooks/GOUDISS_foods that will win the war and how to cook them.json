What are you giving so that others may live? _Eat less_ WHEAT MEAT FATS SUGAR Send more to Europe or they will Starve] FOREWORD Food will win the war, and the nation whose food resources are best conserved will be the victor. This is the truth that our government is trying to drive home to every man, woman and child in America. We have always been happy in the fact that ours was the richest nation in the world, possessing unlimited supplies of food, fuel, energy and ability; but rich as these resources are they will not meet the present food shortage unless every family and every individual enthusiastically co operates in the national saving campaign as outlined by the United States Food Administration. The regulations prescribed for this saving campaign are simple and easy of application. Our government does not ask us to give up three square meals a day nor even one. All it asks is that we substitute as far as possible corn and other cereals for wheat, reduce a little our meat consumption and save sugar and fats by careful utilization of these products. There are few housekeepers who are not eager to help in this saving campaign, and there are few indeed who do not feel the need of conserving family resources. But just how is sometimes a difficult task. This book is planned to solve the housekeeper's problem. It shows how to substitute cereals and other grains for wheat, how to cut down the meat bill by the use of meat extension and meat substitute dishes which supply equivalent nutrition at much less cost; it shows the use of syrup and other products that save sugar, and it explains how to utilize all kinds of fats. It contains 47 recipes for the making of war breads; 64 recipes on low cost meat dishes and meat substitutes; 54 recipes for sugarless desserts; menus for meatless and wheatless days, methods of purchasing in all some two hundred ways of meeting present food conditions at minimum cost and without the sacrifice of nutrition. Not only have its authors planned to help the woman in the home, conserve the family income, but to encourage those saving habits which must be acquired by this nation if we are to secure a permanent peace that will insure the world against another onslaught by the Prussian military powers. A little bit of saving in food means a tremendous aggregate total, when 100,000,000 people are doing the saving. One wheatless meal a day would not mean hardship; there are always corn and other products to be used. Yet one wheatless meal a day in every family would mean a saving of 90,000,000 bushels of wheat, which totals 5,400,000,000 lbs. Two meatless days a week would mean a saving of 2,200,000 lbs. of meat per annum. One teaspoonful of sugar per person saved each day would insure a supply ample to take care of our soldiers and our Allies. These quantities mean but a small individual sacrifice, but when multiplied by our vast population they will immeasurably aid and encourage the men who are giving their lives to the noble cause of humanity on which our nation has embarked. _The Authors._ CONTENTS PAGE FOREWORD 4 SAVE WHEAT: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Wheat, with Practical Recipes for the Use of Other Grains 11 A General rule for proportions in bread making 15 Use of Corn 18 Use of Oats 20 Use of Rye 22 Use of Barley 23 Use of Potatoes 24 Use of Mixed Grains 25 Pancakes and Waffles 27 SAVE MEAT: Reasons Why Our Government Has Asked Us to Save Meat, with Practical Recipes for Meat Conservation 29 Selection of Meat 33, 36, 37, 38 Methods of Cooking 34, 35 Charts 36, 37 Comparative Composition of Meat and Meat Substitutes 38 Economy of Meat and Meat Substitutes 39 Meat Economy Dishes 41 Fish as a Meat Substitute 44 Fish Recipes 46 Cheese as a Meat Substitute 49 Meat Substitute Dishes 53 SAVE SUGAR: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Sugar, with Practical Recipes for Sugarless Desserts, Cakes, Candies and Preserves 57 Sugarless Desserts 61 Sugarless Preserves 71 SAVE FAT: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us to Save Fat, with Practical Recipes for Fat Conservation 73 To Render Fats 78 Various Uses for Leftover Fats 82 SAVE FOOD: Reasons Why Our Government Asks Us Not to Waste Food, with Practical Recipes for the Use of Leftovers 83 A Simple Way to Plan a Balanced Ration 84 Table Showing Number of Calories per Day Required by Various Classes 91 Sauces Make Leftovers Attractive 93 Use of Gelatine in Combining Leftovers 97 Salads Provide an Easy Method of Using Leftovers 99 Use of Stale Bread, Cake and Leftover Cereals 102 Soups Utilize Leftovers 106 All in one dish Meals Needing only fruit or simple dessert, bread and butter to complete a well balanced menu 109 Wheatless Day Menus 113 Meatless Day Menus 115 Meat Substitute Dinners 116 Vegetable Dinners 118 Save and Serve Bread; Meat; Sugar; Fat; Milk; Vegetables 120, 121 Blank Pages for Recording Favorite Family Recipes 122 _The Recipes in this book have been examined and approved by the United States Food Administration_ _Illustrations furnished by courtesy of the United States Food Administration_ [Illustration] All the recipes in this book have been prepared and used in The School of Modern Cookery conducted by _The Forecast Magazine_ and have been endorsed by the U.S. Food Administration. They have been worked out under the direction of Grace E. Frysinger, graduate in Domestic Science of Drexel Institute, of Philadelphia, and the University of Chicago. Miss Frysinger, who has had nine years' experience as a teacher of Domestic Science, has earnestly used her skill to make these recipes practical for home use, and at the same time accurate and scientific. The above illustration shows a class at the School of Modern Cookery. These classes are entirely free, the instruction being given in the interest of household economics. The foods cooked during the demonstration are sampled by the students and in this way it is possible to get in close touch with the needs of the homemakers and the tastes of the average family. FOODS THAT WILL WIN THE WAR [Illustration] SAVE WHEAT _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE WHEAT, WITH PRACTICAL RECIPES FOR THE USE OF OTHER GRAINS_ A slice of bread seems an unimportant thing. Yet one good sized slice of bread weighs an ounce. It contains almost three fourths of an ounce of flour. If every one of the country's 20,000,000 homes wastes on the average only one such slice of bread a day, the country is throwing away daily over 14,000,000 ounces of flour over 875,000 pounds, or enough flour for over a million one pound loaves a day. For a full year at this rate there would be a waste of over 319,000,000 pounds of flour 1,500,000 barrels enough flour to make 365,000,000 loaves. As it takes four and one half bushels of wheat to make a barrel of ordinary flour, this waste would represent the flour from over 7,000,000 bushels of wheat. Fourteen and nine tenths bushels of wheat on the average are raised per acre. It would take the product of some 470,000 acres just to provide a single slice of bread to be wasted daily in every home. But some one says, \"a full slice of bread is not wasted in every home.\" Very well, make it a daily slice for every four or every ten or every thirty homes make it a weekly or monthly slice in every home or make the wasted slice thinner. The waste of flour involved is still appalling. These are figures compiled by government experts, and they should give pause to every housekeeper who permits a slice of bread to be wasted in her home. Another source of waste of which few of us take account is home made bread. Sixty per cent. of the bread used in America is made in the home. When one stops to consider how much home made bread is poorly made, and represents a large waste of flour, yeast and fuel, this housewifely energy is not so commendable. The bread flour used in the home is also in the main wheat flour, and all waste of wheat at the present time increases the shortage of this most necessary food. Fuel, too, is a serious national problem, and all coal used in either range, gas, or electric oven for the baking of poor bread is an actual national loss. There must be no waste in poor baking or from poor care after the bread is made, or from the waste of a crust or crumb. Waste in your kitchen means starvation in some other kitchen across the sea. Our Allies are asking for 450,000,000 bushels of wheat, and we are told that even then theirs will be a privation loaf. Crop shortage and unusual demand has left Canada and the United States, which are the largest sources of wheat, with but 300,000,000 bushels available for export. The deficit must be met by reducing consumption on this side the Atlantic. This can be done by eliminating waste and by making use of cereals and flours other than wheat in bread making. The wide use of wheat flour for bread making has been due to custom. In Europe rye and oats form the staple breads of many countries, and in some sections of the South corn bread is the staff of life. We have only to modify a little our bread eating habits in order to meet the present need. Other cereals can well be used to eke out the wheat, but they require slightly different handling. In making yeast breads, the essential ingredient is gluten, which is extended by carbon dioxide gas formed by yeast growth. With the exception of rye, grains other than wheat do not contain sufficient gluten for yeast bread, and it is necessary to use a wheat in varying proportions in order to supply the deficient gluten. Even the baker's rye loaf is usually made of one half rye and one half wheat. This is the safest proportion for home use in order to secure a good texture. When oatmeal is used, it is necessary to scald the oatmeal to prevent a raw taste. Oatmeal also makes a softer dough than wheat, and it is best to make the loaf smaller and bake it longer: about one hour instead of the forty five minutes which we allow for wheat bread. The addition of one third barley flour to wheat flour makes a light colored, good flavored bread. If a larger proportion than this is used, the loaf has a decided barley flavor. If you like this flavor and increase the proportion of barley, be sure to allow the dough a little longer time to rise, as by increasing the barley you weaken the gluten content of your loaf. Rice and cornmeal can be added to wheat breads in a 10 per cent. proportion. Laboratory tests have shown that any greater proportion than this produces a heavy, small loaf. Potato flour or mashed potato can be used to extend the wheat, it being possible to work in almost 50 per cent. of potato, but this makes a darker and moister loaf than when wheat alone is used. In order to take care of this moisture, it is best to reserve part of the wheat for the second kneading. Graham and entire wheat flour also effect a saving of wheat because a larger percentage of the wheat berry is used. Graham flour is the whole kernel of wheat, ground. Entire wheat flour is the flour resulting from the grinding of all but the outer layer of wheat. A larger use of these coarser flours will therefore help materially in eking out our scant wheat supply as the percentage of the wheat berry used for bread flour is but 72 per cent. Breads made from these coarser flours also aid digestion and are a valuable addition to the dietary. In order to keep down waste by eliminating the poor batch of bread, it is necessary to understand the principles of bread making. Fermentation is the basic principle of yeast bread, and fermentation is controlled by temperature. The yeast plant grows at a temperature from 70 to 90 degrees (Fahrenheit), and if care is taken to maintain this temperature during the process of fermentation, waste caused by sour dough or over fermentation will be eliminated. When we control the temperature we can also reduce the time necessary for making a loaf of bread, or several loaves of bread as may be needed, into as short a period as three hours. This is what is known as the quick method. It not only saves time and labor, but, controlling the temperature, insures accurate results. The easiest way to control the temperature is to put the bowl containing the dough into another of slightly larger size containing water at a temperature of 90 degrees. The water of course should never be hot. Hot water kills the yeast plant. Cold water checks its growth. Cover the bowl and set it in the gas oven or fireless cooker or on the shelf of the coal range. As the water in the large bowl cools off, remove a cupful and add a cupful of hot water. At the end of one and one half hours the dough should have doubled in bulk. Take it out of the pan and knead until the large gas bubbles are broken (about ten minutes). Then place in greased bread pans and allow to rise for another half hour. At the end of this time it will not only fill the pan, but will project out of it. Do not allow the dough to rise too high, for then the bread will have large holes in it. A good proportion as a general rule to follow, is: 3 1/2 cupfuls of flour (this includes added cereals) 1 cupful of water or milk 1/2 tablespoon shortening 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cake of compressed yeast In this recipe sugar has been omitted because of the serious shortage, but after the war a teaspoon of sugar should be added. The shortening, although small in quantity, may also be omitted. These materials make a loaf of about one pound, which should be baked in forty to fifty minutes at a temperature of 450 degrees (Fahrenheit). Allow a little longer time for bread containing oatmeal or other grains. Such breads require a little longer baking and a little lower temperature than wheat breads. If you do not use a thermometer in testing your oven, place a piece of paper on the center shelf, and if it browns in two minutes your oven is right. If a longer period for raising is allowed than is suggested in the above recipe, the yeast proportion should be decreased. For overnight bread use one quarter yeast cake per loaf; for six hour bread, use one half yeast cake per loaf; for three hour bread, use one yeast cake per loaf. In baking, the time allowed should depend on the size of the loaf. When baked at a temperature of 450 degrees, large loaves take from forty five to sixty minutes, small loaves from thirty to forty minutes, rolls from ten to twenty minutes. It is well to divide the oven time into four parts. During the first quarter, the rising continues; second quarter, browning begins; the third quarter, browning is finished; the fourth quarter, bread shrinks from the side of the pan. These are always safe tests to follow in your baking. When baked, the bread should be turned out of the pans and allow to cool on a wire rack. When cool, put the bread in a stone crock or bread box. To prevent staleness, keep the old bread away from the fresh scald the bread crock or give your bread box a sun bath at frequent intervals. Even with all possible care to prevent waste, yeast breads will not conserve our wheat supply so well as quick breads, because all yeast breads need a larger percentage of wheat. The home baker can better serve her country by introducing into her menus numerous quick breads that can be made from cornmeal, rye, corn and rye, hominy, and buckwheat. Griddle cakes and waffles can also be made from lentils, soy beans, potatoes, rice and peas. Do not expect that the use of other cereals in bread making will reduce the cost of your bread. That is not the object. Saving of wheat for war needs is the thing we are striving for, and this is as much an act of loyalty as buying Liberty Bonds. It is to meet the crucial world need of bread that we are learning to substitute, and not to spare the national purse. Besides this saving of wheat, our Government also asks us to omit all fat from our yeast breads in order to conserve the diminishing fat supply. This may seem impossible to the woman who has never made bread without shortening, but recent experiments in bread making laboratories have proved that bread, without shortening, is just as light and as good in texture as that made with shortening the only difference being a slight change in flavor. These experiments have also shown that it is possible to supply shortening by the introduction of 3 per cent. to 5 per cent. of canned cocoanut or of peanut butter, and that sugar may also be omitted from bread making recipes. In fact, the war is bringing about manifold interesting experiments which prove that edible and nutritious bread can be made of many things besides the usual white flour. The recipes herewith appended, showing the use of combinations of cereals and wheat, have been carefully tested in The Forecast School of Modern Cookery. Good bread can be made from each recipe, and the new flavors obtained by the use of other grains make a pleasing and wholesome variety. A family which has eaten oatmeal or entire wheat bread will never again be satisfied with a diet that includes only bread made from bleached flour. Children, especially, will be benefited by the change, as the breads made from coarser flours are not only more nutritious, but are rich in the minerals and vitamine elements that are so essential to the growth of strong teeth, bones and growing tissues. The homemaker, too, will never regret her larger acquaintance with bread making materials, as the greater variety of breads that she will find herself able to produce will be a source of pleasure and keen satisfaction.

[Illustration: Each Food Shown is Equivalent in Protein to the Platter of Meat in the Center of the Picture.] SAVE MEAT _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED US TO SAVE MEAT WITH PRACTICAL RECIPES FOR MEAT CONSERVATION_ As a nation we eat and waste 80 per cent. more meat than we require to maintain health. This statement, recently issued by the United States Food Administration, is appalling when we consider that there is a greater demand for meat in the world to day than ever before, coupled with a greatly decreased production. The increase in the demand for meat and animal products is due to the stress of the war. Millions of men are on the fighting line doing hard physical labor, and require a larger food allowance than when they were civilians. To meet the demand for meat and to save their grains, our Allies have been compelled to kill upward of thirty three million head of their stock animals, and they have thus stifled their animal production. This was burning the candle at both ends, and they now face increased demand handicapped by decreased production. America must fill the breach. Not only must we meet the present increased demand, but we must be prepared as the war advances to meet an even greater demand for this most necessary food. The way out of this serious situation is first to reduce meat consumption to the amount really needed and then to learn to use other foods that will supply the food element which is found in meat. This element is called protein, and we depend upon it to build and repair body tissues. Although most persons believe that protein can only be obtained from meat, it is found in many other foods, such as milk, skim milk, cheese, cottage cheese, poultry, eggs, fish, dried peas, beans, cow peas, lentils and nuts. For instance, pound for pound, salmon, either fresh or canned, equals round steak in protein content; cream cheese contains one quarter more protein and three times as much fat; peanuts (hulled) one quarter more protein and three and a half times as much fat; beans (dried) a little more protein and one fifth as much fat; eggs (one dozen) about the same in protein and one half more fat. It is our manifest duty to learn how to make the best use of these foods in order to save beef, pork and mutton, to be shipped across the sea. This means that the housekeeper has before her the task of training the family palate to accept new food preparations. Training the family palate is not easy, because bodies that have grown accustomed to certain food combinations find it difficult to get along without them, and rebel at a change. If these habits of diet are suddenly disturbed we may upset digestion, as well as create a feeling of dissatisfaction which is equally harmful to physical well being. The wise housekeeper will therefore make her changes gradually. In reducing meat in the diet of a family that has been used to having meat twice a day, it will be well to start out with meat once a day and keep up this r\u00e9gime for a couple of weeks. Then drop meat for a whole day, supplying in its stead a meat substitute dish that will furnish the same nutriment. After a while you can use meat substitutes at least twice a week without disturbing the family's mental or physical equilibrium. It would be well also to introduce dishes that extend the meat flavor, such as stews combined with dumplings, hominy, or rice; pot pies or short cakes with a dressing of meat and vegetables; meat loaf, souffle or croquettes in which meat is combined with bread crumbs, potato or rice. Meat eating is largely a matter of flavor. If flavor is supplied, the reduction of meat in the diet can be made with little annoyance. Nutrition can always be supplied in the other dishes that accompany the meal, as a certain proportion of protein is found in almost every food product. The meat that we use to obtain flavor in sauces and gravies need not be large in quantity, nor expensive in cut. The poor or cheap cuts have generally more flavor than the expensive ones, the difference being entirely in texture and tenderness, freedom from gristle and inedible tissue. There are many cereals, such as rice, hominy, cornmeal, samp and many vegetable dishes, especially dried beans of all kinds, that are greatly improved by the addition of meat sauce and when prepared in this way may be served as the main dish of a meal. Dr. Harvey W. Wiley has stated that the meat eating of the future will not be regarded as a necessity so much as it has been in the past, and that meat will be used more as a condimental substance. Europe has for years used meat for flavor rather than for nutriment. It would seem that the time has come for Americans to learn the use of meat for flavor and to utilize more skillfully the protein of other foods. It may be difficult to convince the meat lover that he can radically reduce the proportion of meat in his diet without detriment to health. Many persons adhere to the notion that you are not nourished unless you eat meat; that meat foods are absolutely necessary to maintain the body strength. This idea is entirely without foundation, for the foods mentioned as meat substitutes earlier in this chapter can be made to feed the world, and feed it well in fact, no nation uses so large a proportion of meat as America. The first step, therefore, in preparing ourselves to reduce meat consumption is to recognize that only a small quantity of meat is necessary to supply sufficient protein for adult life. The growing child or the youth springing into manhood needs a larger percentage of meat than the adult, and in apportioning the family's meat ration this fact should not be overlooked. The second step is to reduce the amount purchased, choosing cuts that contain the least waste, and by utilizing with care that which we do purchase. Fat, trimmings, and bones all have their uses and should be saved from the garbage pail. Careful buying, of course, depends on a knowledge of cuts, a study of the percentage of waste in each cut, and the food value of the different kinds of meat. Make a study of the different cuts, as shown in the charts on pages 36, 37, and armed with this knowledge go forth to the butcher for practical buying. Then comes the cooking, which can only be properly done when the fundamental principles of the cooking processes, such as boiling, braising, broiling, stewing, roasting and frying are understood. Each cut requires different handling to secure the maximum amount of nutriment and flavor. The waste occasioned by improper cooking is a large factor in both household and national economy. It has been estimated that a waste of an ounce each day of edible meat or fat in the twenty million American homes amounts to 456,000,000 pounds of valuable animal food a year. At average dressed weights, this amounts to 875,000 steers, or over 3,000,000 hogs. Each housekeeper, therefore, who saves her ounce a day aids in this enormous saving, which will mean so much in the feeding of our men on the fighting line. So the housekeeper who goes to her task of training the family palate to accept meat substitutes and meat economy dishes, who revolutionizes her methods of cooking so as to utilize even \"the pig's squeak,\" will be doing her bit toward making the world safe for democracy. The following charts, tables of nutritive values and suggested menus have been arranged to help her do this work. The American woman has her share in this great world struggle, and that is the intelligent conservation of food. SELECTION OF MEAT BEEF Dull red as cut, brighter after exposure to air; lean, well mottled with fat; flesh, firm; fat, yellowish in color. Best beef from animal 3 to 5 years old, weighing 900 to 1,200 pounds. Do not buy wet, soft, or pink beef. VEAL Flesh pink. (If white, calf was bled before killed or animal too young.) The fat should be white. MUTTON Best from animal 3 years old. Flesh dull red, fat firm and white. LAMB (Spring Lamb 3 months to 6 months old; season, February to March.) Bones of lamb should be small; end of bone in leg of lamb should be serrated; flesh pink, and fat white. PORK The lean should be fine grained and pale pink. The skin should be smooth and clear. If flesh is soft, or fat yellowish, pork is not good. SELECTION OF TOUGHER CUTS AND THEIR USES Less expensive cuts of meat have more nourishment than the more expensive, and if properly cooked and seasoned, have as much tenderness. Tough cuts, as chuck or top sirloin, may be boned and rolled and then roasted by the same method as tender cuts, the only difference will be that the tougher cuts require longer cooking. Have the bones from rolled meats sent home to use for soups. Corned beef may be selected from flank, naval, plate or brisket. These cuts are more juicy than rump or round cuts. 1. _For pot roast_ use chuck, crossrib, round, shoulder, rump or top sirloin. 2. _For stew_ use shin, shoulder, top sirloin or neck. 3. _For steaks_ use flank, round or chuck. If these cuts are pounded, or both pounded and rubbed with a mixture of 1 part vinegar and 2 parts oil before cooking, they will be very tender. 4. _Soups_ Buy shin or neck. The meat from these may be utilized by serving with horseradish or mustard sauce, or combined with equal amount of fresh meat for meat loaf, scalloped dish, etc. DRY METHODS 1. _Roasting or Baking_ Oven roasting or baking is applied to roasts. Place the roast in a hot oven, or if gas is used, put in the broiling oven to sear the outside quickly, and thus keep in the juices. Salt, pepper and flour. If an open roasting pan is used place a few tablespoonfuls of fat and 1 cup of water in the pan, which should be used to baste the roast frequently. If a covered pan is used basting is unnecessary. Beef or mutton (5 to 8 lbs.) 10 min. to the lb. 10 min. extra Lamb (5 to 8 lbs.) 12 min. to the lb. 12 min. extra Veal (5 to 8 lbs.) 15 min. to the lb. 15 min. extra Pork (5 to 8 lbs.) 25 min. to the lb. 25 min. extra Turkey 20 min. to the lb. Chicken 30 min. to the lb. Duck 30 min. to the lb. Goose 30 min. to the lb. Game 30 min. to the lb. 2. _Broiling_ Cooking over or under clear fire. This method is used for chops or steaks. Sear the meat on both sides. Then reduce the heat and turn the meat frequently. Use no fat. _Time Table_ (Count time after meat is seared). 1/2 inch chops or steaks, 5 minutes 1 inch chops or steaks, 10 minutes 2 inch chops or steaks, 15 to 18 minutes 3. _Pan Broiling_ Cooking in pan with no fat. _Time table same as for broiling_ chops, steaks, etc. 4. _Saut\u00e9ing_ Cooking in pan in small amount of fat. Commonly termed \"frying.\" Used for steaks, chops, etc. _Time table same as for broiling._ MOIST METHODS 1. Boiling Cooking in boiling water especially poultry, salt meats, etc. 2. Steaming A method of cooking by utilizing steam from boiling water, which retains more food value than any other. Too seldom applied to meats. 3. Frying Cooking by immersion in hot fat at temperature 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Used for croquettes, etc. If a fat thermometer is not available, test by using small pieces of bread. Put into heated fat: A For croquettes made from food requiring little cooking, such as oysters, or from previously cooked mixtures, as rice, fish or meat croquettes, bread should brown in one half minute. B For mixtures requiring cooking, as doughnuts, fritters, etc., bread should brown in one minute. COMBINATION METHODS 1. Pot Roasting Cooking (by use of steam from small amount of water) tough cuts of meat which have been browned but not cooked thoroughly. Season meat. Dredge with flour. Sear in hot pan until well browned. Place oil rack in pot containing water to height of one inch, but do not let water reach the meat. Keep water slowly boiling. Replenish as needed with boiling water. This method renders tough cuts tender, but requires several hours cooking. 2. Stewing A combination of methods which draws part of flavor into gravy and retains part in pieces which are to be used as meat. Cut meat into pieces suitable for serving. Cover one half of meat with cold water. Let stand one hour. Bring slowly to boiling point. Dredge other half of meat with flour and brown in small amount of fat. Add to the other mixture and cook slowly 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until tender, adding diced vegetables, thickening and seasoning as desired one half hour before cooking is finished. 3. Fricasseeing Cooking in a sauce until tender, meat which has been previously browned but not cooked throughout. Brown meat in small amount of fat. Place in boiling water to cover. Cook slowly until tender. To 1 pint of water in which meat is cooked, add 1/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne, and 1/4 cup milk, thoroughly blended. When at boiling point, add one beaten egg, 1 tablespoon chopped parsley and 1 tablespoon cold water well mixed, Add cooked meat and serve. [Illustration: VEAL] Neck for stews.

Study and know what the actual needs are, and you will not make unnecessary expenditures. Learn what the various cuts of meat are, what they can be used for, and which are best suited to the particular needs of your household. Study the timeliness of buying certain cuts of meats. There are days when prices are lower than normal. Always check the butcher's weights by watching him closely or by weighing the goods on scales of your own. Always buy a definite quantity. Ask what the pound rate is, and note any fractional part of the weight. Don't ask for \"ten or twenty cents' worth.\" Select your meat or fish personally. There is no doubt that high retail prices are due to the tendency of many housewives to do their buying by telephone or through their servants. Test the freshness of meat and fish. Staleness of meat and fish is shown by loose and flabby flesh. The gills of fresh fish are red and the fins stiff. Make all the purchases possible at a public market, if you can walk to it, or if carfare will not make too large an increase in the amount you have set aside for the day's buying. A food chopper can be made to pay for itself in a short time by the great variety of ways it furnishes of utilizing left overs. If possible, buy meat trimmings. They cost 20 cents a pound and can be used in many ways. Buy the ends of bacon strips. They are just as nutritious as sliced bacon and cost 50 per cent. less. Learn to use drippings in place of butter for cooking purposes. Buy cracked eggs. They cost much less than whole ones and are usually just as good. Keep a stock pot. Drop into it all left overs. These make an excellent basis for soup stock. Don't throw away the heads and bones of fish. Clean them and use them with vegetables for fish chowder or cream of fish soup. Study attractive ways of serving food. Plain, cheap, dishes can be made appetizing if they look attractive on the table. Experiment with meat substitutes. Cheese, dried vegetables and the cheaper varieties of fish can supply all the nutriment of meat at a much lower cost. Don't do your cooking \"by guess.\" If the various ingredients are measured accurately, the dish will taste better and cost less. Don't buy delicatessen food if you can possibly avoid it. Delicatessen meals cost 15 per cent. more than the same meals cooked at home, and the food is not as nourishing. You pay for the cooking and the rent of the delicatessen store, as well as the proprietor's profit. Don't pay five or ten cents more a dozen for white eggs in the belief that they are superior to brown eggs. The food value of each is the same. The difference in shell color is due to the breed of hen. Tell the butcher to give you the trimmings of chicken, i.e., the head, feet, fat and giblets. They make delicious chicken soup. The feet contain gelatine, which gives soup consistency. Buy a tough, and consequently less expensive, chicken and make it tender by steaming it for three hours before roasting. Don't put meat wrapped in paper into the ice box, as the paper tends to absorb the juices. Try to find a way to buy at least a part of your meats and eggs direct from the farm. You will get fresher, better food, and if it is sent by parcels post it can usually be delivered to your table for much less than city prices. MEAT ECONOMY DISHES MOCK DUCK 1 flank steak 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon pepper 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 1 cup breadcrumbs 1 tablespoon onion juice 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning 1 pint boiling water 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour Reserve the water and the flour. Mix other ingredients. Spread on steak. Roll the steak and tie. Roll in the flour. Brown in two tablespoons of fat. Add the water cover and cook until tender. BEEF STEW 1 lb. of meat from the neck, cross ribs, shin or knuckles 1 sliced onion 3/4 cup carrots 1/2 cup turnips 1 cup potatoes 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon pepper 1/2 cup flour 1 quart water Soak one half of the meat, cut in small pieces, in the quart of water for one hour. Heat slowly to boiling point. Season the other half of the meat with salt and pepper. Roll in flour. Brown in three tablespoons of fat with the onion. Add to the soaked meat, which has been brought to the boiling point. Cook one hour or until tender. Add the vegetables, and flour mixed with half cup of cold water. Cook until vegetables are tender. HAM SOUFFLE 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs 2 cups scalded milk 1 1/2 cups chopped cooked ham 2 egg yolks 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 1 teaspoon minced onion 1/2 teaspoon paprika 2 egg whites PARSLEY SAUCE 2 tablespoons butter 3 tablespoons flour 1 cup milk 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons chopped parsley For the souffl\u00e9, cook together breadcrumbs and milk for two minutes. Remove from fire, add ham and mix well. Add egg yolks, first beating these well; also the parsley (one tablespoon), onion and paprika. Fold in, last of all, the egg whites whipped to a stiff, dry froth. Turn quickly into a well greased baking dish and bake in moderate oven for thirty five minutes, or until firm to the touch; meantime, make the parsley sauce, so that both can be served instantly when the souffl\u00e9 is done; then it will not fall and grow tough. For the parsley sauce, melt the butter in saucepan and stir in the flour, stirring until perfectly smooth, then add the milk slowly, stirring constantly; cook until thick, stir in the parsley and salt, and serve at once in a gravy boat. BATTLE PUDDING BATTER 1 cup flour 1/2 cup milk 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 egg 4 tablespoons water 1/2 teaspoon salt FILLING 2 cups coarsely chopped cold cooked meat 1 tablespoon drippings 1 medium sized potato 1 cup stock or hot water salt and pepper 1 small onion Any cold meat may be used for this. Cut it into inch pieces. Slice the onion and potato and fry in drippings until onion is slightly browned. Add the meat and stock, or hot water, or dissolve in hot water any left over meat gravy. Cook all together until potato is soft, but not crumbled; season with the pepper and salt. Thicken with a tablespoon of flour and turn into a pudding dish. Make a batter by sifting together flour, baking powder and salt; stir in the egg and milk, mixed with the water. Beat hard until free from lumps, then pour over meat and vegetables in the pudding and bake until brown. CHINESE MUTTON 1 pint chopped cooked mutton 1 head shredded lettuce 1 can cooked peas 1/8 teaspoon pepper 1 tablespoon fat 1 1/2 cups broth 1 teaspoon of salt Cook 15 minutes. Serve as a border around rice. SHEPHERD'S PIE 2 cups chopped cooked mutton 1 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon pepper 1/4 teaspoon curry powder 2 cups hominy 1 cup peas or carrots 1/2 pint of brown sauce or water Put meat and vegetables in baking dish. Cover with rice, hominy, or samp, which has been cooked. Bake until brown. SCALLOPED HAM AND HOMINY 2 cups hominy (cooked) 1 cup chopped cooked ham 1/3 cup fat 1/3 cup flour 1 teaspoon of salt 1/8 teaspoon mustard 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 1 egg 1 cup milk 1/2 cup water Melt the fat. Add the dry ingredients and the liquid slowly. When at boiling point, add hominy and ham. Stir in the egg. Place in a baking dish. Cover with buttered crumbs. Bake until brown. BEEF LOAF 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 tablespoon sour pickle 2 teaspoons salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon celery salt To 1 tablespoon of gelatine, softened in 1/2 cup of cold water add 1 cup of hot tomato juice and pulp. Add seasoned meat. Chill and slice. May be served with salad dressing. BAKED HASH 1 cup chopped cooked meat 2 cups raw potato, cut fine 1 tablespoon onion juice 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 1/8 teaspoon pepper 1/4 cup drippings 1/2 cup gravy or water Melt fat in frying pan. Put in all the other ingredients. Cook over a slow fire for 1/2 hour. Fold and serve as omelet. MEAT SHORTCAKE 1 1/2 cups flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons shortening 2 teaspoons baking powder 2 cups chopped, cooked meat 1 teaspoon onion juice 1/2 cup gravy or soup stock Salt and pepper 3/4 cup milk and water Mix flour, salt and baking powder. Rub in shortening, and mix to dough with milk and water. Roll out to quarter of an inch thickness, bake in layer cake tins. Put together with the chopped meat mixed with the onion and seasoning, and heated hot with the gravy or stock. If stock is used, thicken with a tablespoon of flour mixed with one of butter, or butter substitute. Serve as soon as put together. Cold cooked fish heated in cream sauce may be used for a filling instead of the meat. SCRAPPLE Place a pig's head in 4 quarts of cold water and bring slowly to the boil. Skim carefully and season the liquid highly with salt, cayenne and a teaspoon of rubbed sage. Let the liquid simmer gently until the meat falls from the bones. Strain off the liquid, remove the bones, and chop the meat fine. Measure the liquid and allow 1 cup of sifted cornmeal to 3 cups of liquid. Blend the cornmeal in the liquid and simmer until it is the consistency of thick porridge. Stir in the chopped meat and pour in greased baking pans to cool. One third buckwheat may be used instead of cornmeal, and any kind of chopped meat can be blended with the pork if desired. Any type of savory herb can also be used, according to taste. When scrapple is to be eaten, cut into one half inch slices, dredge with flour, and brown in hot fat. FISH AS A MEAT SUBSTITUTE As the main course at a meal, fish may be served accompanied by vegetables or it may be prepared as a \"one meal dish\" requiring only bread and butter and a simple dessert to complete a nutritious and well balanced diet. A lack of proper knowledge of selection of fish for the different methods of cooking, and the improper cooking of fish once it is acquired, are responsible to a large extent for the prejudice so frequently to be found against the use of fish. The kinds of fish obtainable in different markets vary somewhat, but the greatest difficulty for many housekeepers seems to be, to know what fish may best be selected for baking, broiling, etc., and the tests for fish when cooked. An invariable rule for cooking fish is to apply high heat at first, until the flesh is well seared so as to retain the juices; then a lower temperature until the flesh is cooked throughout. Fish is thoroughly cooked when the flesh flakes. For broiling or pan broiling, roll fish in flour or cornmeal, preferably the latter, which has been well seasoned with salt and cayenne. This causes the outside to be crisp and also gives added flavor. Leftover bits of baked or other fish may be combined with white sauce or tomato sauce, or variations of these sauces, and served as creamed fish, or placed in a greased baking dish, crumbs placed on top and browned and served as scalloped fish. Fish canapes, fish cocktail, fish soup or chowder; baked, steamed, broiled or pan broiled fish, entrees without number, and fish salad give opportunity to use it in endless variety. Combined with starchy foods such as rice, hominy, macaroni, spaghetti or potato, and accompanied by a green vegetable or fruit, the dish becomes a meal. Leftover bits may also be utilized for salad, either alone with cooked or mayonaise salad dressing, or combined with vegetables such as peas, carrots, cucumbers, etc. The addition of a small amount of chopped pickle to fish salad improves its flavor, or a plain or tomato gelatine foundation may be used as a basis for the salad. The appended lists of fish suitable for the various methods of cooking, and the variety in the recipes for the uses of fish, have been arranged to encourage a wider use of this excellent meat substitute, so largely eaten by European epicures, but too seldom included in American menus. During the period of the war, the larger use of fish is a patriotic measure in that it will save the beef, mutton and pork needed for our armies. FISH SHORTCAKE 2 cups cooked meat or fish 1 cup gravy or water 1 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 1 teaspoon onion juice 2 cups rye flour 1 teaspoon of salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 4 teaspoons baking powder 4 tablespoons fat 1 cup gravy, water or milk Place meat or fish and seasonings in greased dish.

FOOD WILL WIN THE WAR DON'T WASTE IT \"_To provide adequate supplies for the coming year is of absolutely vital importance to the conduct of the war, and without a very conscientious elimination of waste and very strict economy in our food consumption, we cannot hope to fulfill this primary duty._\" _WOODROW WILSON._ [Illustration] SAVE SUGAR _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE SUGAR WITH PRACTICAL RECIPES FOR SUGARLESS DESSERTS, CAKES, CANDIES AND PRESERVES._ One ounce of sugar less per person, per day, is all our Government asks of us to meet the world sugar shortage. One ounce of sugar equals two scant level tablespoonfuls and represents a saving that every man, woman and child should be able to make. Giving up soft drinks and the frosting on our cakes, the use of sugarless desserts and confections, careful measuring and thorough stirring of that which we place in our cups of tea and coffee, and the use of syrup, molasses or honey on our pancakes and fritters will more than effect this saving. It seems but a small sacrifice, if sacrifice it can be called, when one recognizes that cutting down sugar consumption will be most beneficial to national health. The United States is the largest consumer of sugar in the world. In 1916 Germany's consumption was 20 lbs. per person per year, Italy's 29 to 30 lbs., that of France 37, of England 40, while the United States averaged 85 lbs. This enormous consumption is due to the fact that we are a nation of candy eaters. We spend annually $80,000,000 on confections. These are usually eaten between meals, causing digestive disturbances as well as unwarranted expense. Sweets are a food and should be eaten at the close of the meal, and if this custom is established during the war, not only will tons of sugar be available for our Allies, but the health of the nation improved. The average daily consumption of sugar per person in this country is 5 ounces, and yet nutritional experts agree that not more than 3 ounces a day should be taken. The giving up of one ounce per day will, therefore, be of great value in reducing many prevalent American ailments. Flatulent dyspepsia, rheumatism, diabetes, and stomach acidity are only too frequently traced to an oversupply of sugar in our daily diet. Most persons apparently think of sugar merely as a sweetening agent, forgetting entirely the fact that it is a most concentrated food. It belongs to what is called the carbohydrate group, upon which we largely depend for energy and heat. It is especially valuable to the person doing active physical work, the open air worker, or the healthy, active, growing child, but should be used sparingly by other classes of people. Sugar is not only the most concentrated fuel food in the dietary, but it is one that is very readily utilized in the body, 98 per cent. of it being available for absorption, while within thirty minutes of the time it is taken into the system part of it is available for energy. As a food it must be supplied, especially to the classes of people mentioned above, but as a confection it can well be curtailed. When it is difficult to obtain, housekeepers must avail themselves of changed recipes and different combinations to supply the necessary three ounces per day and to gain the much desired sweet taste so necessary to many of our foods of neutral flavor with which sugar is usually combined. Our grandmothers knew how to prepare many dishes without sugar. In their day lack of transportation facilities, of refining methods and various economic factors made molasses, sorghum, honey, etc., the only common methods of sweetening. But the housekeeper of to day knows little of sweetening mediums except sugar, and sugar shortage is to her a crucial problem. There are many ways, however, of getting around sugar shortage and many methods of supplying the necessary food value and sweetening. By the use of marmalades, jams and jellies canned during the season when the sugar supply was less limited, necessity for the use of sugar can be vastly reduced. By the addition to desserts and cereals of dried fruits, raisins, dates, prunes and figs, which contain large amounts of natural sugar, the sugar consumption can be greatly lessened. By utilizing leftover syrup from canned or preserved fruits for sweetening other fruits, and by the use of honey, molasses, maple sugar, maple syrup and corn syrup, large quantities of sugar may be saved. The substitution of sweetened condensed milk for dairy milk in tea, coffee and cocoa in fact, in all our cooking processes where milk is required will also immeasurably aid in sugar conservation. The substitutes mentioned are all available in large amounts. Honey is especially valuable for children, as it consists of the more simple sugars which are less irritating than cane sugar, and there is no danger of acid stomach from the amounts generally consumed. As desserts are the chief factor in the use of quantities of sugar in our diet, the appended recipes will be of value, as they deal with varied forms of nutritious, attractive sugarless desserts. It is only by the one ounce savings of each individual member of our great one hundred million population that the world sugar shortage may be met, and it is hoped every housekeeper will study her own time tested recipes with the view of utilizing as far as possible other forms of sweetening. In most recipes the liquid should be slightly reduced in amount and about one fifth more of the substitute should be used than the amount of sugar called for. With a few tests along this line one will be surprised how readily the substitution may be made. If all sweetening agents become scarce, desserts can well be abandoned. Served at the end of a full meal, desserts are excess food except in the diet of children, where they should form a component part of the meal.

SUGARLESS CANDIES FRUIT PASTE 2 teaspoons gelatine 2 tablespoons cold water 1/3 cup corn syrup 2 teaspoons cornstarch 1/4 cup chopped nuts 1/2 cup chopped dates 1/2 cup chopped raisins 1/4 teaspoon vanilla Mix cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water. Heat corn syrup to the boil, add cornstarch and cook for three minutes. Soften the gelatine in two tablespoons cold water for five minutes; stir into the hot syrup after taking from fire. When gelatine has dissolved add the fruit and nuts and flavoring. Chill, cut in squares, and roll each in powdered sugar. WARTIME TAFFY 2 cups corn syrup 1/2 teaspoon soda 1 teaspoon water 2 tablespoons vinegar Boil the syrup for fifteen minutes, then add the soda. Cook until a little snaps brittle when dropped in cold water. Add the vinegar when this stage is reached and pour into oiled pans. When cool enough to handle, pull until white; make into inch thick rolls and clip off into neat mouthfuls with oiled scissors, or chill and break into irregular pieces when cold. PEANUT BRITTLE 1 cup corn syrup 1 tablespoon fat 1 cup peanuts Boil syrup and fat until brittle when tested in cold water. Grease a pan, sprinkle the roasted and shelled peanuts in it, making an even distribution, then turn in the syrup. When almost cold mark into squares. Cocoanut, puffed wheat or puffed rice may be used for candy instead of peanuts. RAISIN AND PEANUT LOAF Put equal quantity of seeded raisins and roasted peanuts through the food chopper, using the coarsest blade. Moisten with molasses just enough so that the mixture can be molded into a loaf. Chill, cut and serve as candy. Chopped English walnuts combined with chopped dates or figs make a very delicious loaf sweetmeat. POPCORN BALLS AND FRITTERS 1 cup corn syrup 2 tablespoons vinegar Popcorn Cook syrup for fifteen minutes, add vinegar, then when a little snaps when dropped in cold water turn over popped corn, mix well, and form into balls with oiled hands, or if fritters are desired, roll out the mass while warm and cut out with a greased cutter. COCOANUT LOAF 1 cup shredded cocoanut 1/2 cup chopped dates 1/4 cup corn syrup 1/8 teaspoon mapline Mix corn syrup and mapline. Add enough to the dates and cocoanut to form a stiff cake. Mold into neat square at least an inch thick. Let stand in the refrigerator for one hour, then cut in squares and roll each in cornstarch. STUFFED DATES Mix one half cup each of chopped peanuts and raisins. Add a teaspoon of lemon juice and two tablespoons of cream cheese. Remove stones from fine large dates, and in their place insert a small roll of the cheese mixture. These are nice in place of candy or can be served with salad. FRUIT LOAF 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup nuts 2 tablespoons honey, maple syrup or corn syrup 1/2 cup figs or dates Put fruit and nuts through the food chopper, using the coarsest blade. Add enough syrup or honey to make a stiff loaf. Place in the refrigerator for one hour; slice and serve in place of candy, rolling each slice in cornstarch. STUFFED FIGS Cut a slit in the side of dried figs, take out some of the pulp with the tip of a teaspoon. Mix with one quarter cup of the pulp and one quarter cup of finely chopped crystalized ginger, a teaspoon of grated orange or lemon rind; and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Fill the figs with mixture, stuffing them so that they look plump. SUGARLESS PRESERVES QUINCE OR PEAR PRESERVES 1 lb. fruit 1 cup corn syrup 1/4 lb. ginger root or 2 oz. crystalized ginger Steam or cook sliced and pared fruit in small amount of water until tender. Add ginger and corn syrup. Cook 20 minutes slowly. Lemon skins may be used instead of ginger root. APPLE, QUINCE, PEACH, PEAR OR PLUM JAM 1 cup left over cooked fruit or pulp from skins and core 3/4 cup corn syrup 2 tablespoons vinegar 1/2 teaspoon mixed ground spices, allspice, cloves and nutmeg Cook slowly until thick.

Add any fruit and cook slowly 20 minutes or until fruit is clear and syrup thick. If hard fruits, such as pears, quinces, etc., are used, steam for 20 minutes before adding to syrup. SYRUP FOR CANNED FRUIT 1 cup corn syrup 1 cup water Bring to boiling point. Use same as sugar and water syrup. SYRUP FOR PRESERVED FRUIT 2 cups crystal corn syrup For each three pounds of fruit 1/2 cup water Use same as water and sugar syrup. CRANBERRY JELLY 1 pint cranberries 1/2 cup water About 1 cup corn syrup Cook cranberries in water very slowly until tender. Leave whole or press through colander. Measure amount of mixture and add equal amount of corn syrup. Cook slowly until mixture forms jelly when tested on cold plate. Turn into mold which has been rinsed in cold water. APRICOT AND RAISIN MARMALADE 1 cup of apricots 1 1/2 cups cold water 1 cup corn syrup 1/2 cup chopped seeded raisins 1 teaspoon orange rind Soak apricots and raisins in the water two hours. Cook slowly until very soft. Add other ingredients and cook slowly (about 30 minutes) until slightly thick. Place in sterile jars or glasses and seal. [Illustration] SAVE FAT _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE FAT, WITH PRACTICAL RECIPES FOR FAT CONSERVATION_ With the world wide decrease of animal production, animal fats are now growing so scarce that the world is being scoured for new sources of supply. Our Government has asked the housewife to conserve all the fats that come to her home and utilize them to the best advantage. To this end it is necessary to have some knowledge of the character of different fats and the purposes to which they are best adapted. The word fat usually brings to one's mind an unappetizing chunk of meat fat which most persons cannot and will not eat, and fatty foods have been popularly supposed to be \"bad for us\" and \"hard to digest.\" Fats are, however, an important food absolutely essential to complete nutrition, which repay us better for the labor of digestion than any other food. If they are indigestible, it is usually due to improper cooking or improper use; if they are expensive, it is merely because they are extravagantly handled. The chief function of fatty food is to repair and renew the fatty tissues, to yield energy and to maintain the body heat. The presence of fat in food promotes the flow of the pancreatic juice and bile, which help in the assimilation of other foods and assist the excretory functions of the intestine. These are badly performed if bile and other digestive fluids are not secreted in sufficient quantity. The absence of fat in the diet leads to a state of malnutrition, predisposing to tuberculosis, especially in children and young persons. It is claimed that the most serious food shortage in Germany is fat; that the civilian population is dying in large numbers because of the lack of it, and that Von Hindenburg's men will lose out on the basis of fat, rather than on the basis of munitions or military organization. Worst of all is the effect of fat shortage on the children of the nation. Leaders of thought all over Europe assert that even if Germany wins, Germany has lost, because it has sapped the strength of its coming generation. The term fat is used to designate all products of fatty composition and includes liquid fats such as oils, soft fats such as butter, and hard fats such as tallow. While all fats have practically the same energy value, they differ widely from each other in their melting point, and the difference in digestibility seems to correspond to the difference in melting point. Butter burns at 240 degrees Fahrenheit, while vegetable oils can be heated as high as 600 degrees Fahrenheit, furnishing a very high temperature for cooking purposes before they begin to burn. The scorching of fat not only wastes the product, but renders it indigestible, even dangerous to some people, and for this reason butter should never be used for frying, as frying temperature is usually higher than 240 degrees. It is well to choose for cooking only those fats which have the highest heat resisting qualities because they do not burn so easily. Beginning with the lowest burning point, fats include genuine butter, substitute butters, lard and its substitutes, and end with tallow and vegetable oils. Of the latter, there is a varied selection from the expensive olive oil to the cheaper cottonseed, peanut, cocoanut and corn oils and their compounds and the hydrogenated oils. The economy of fat, therefore, depends on the choice of the fat used for the various cooking processes as well as the conservation of all fatty residue, such as crackling, leftover frying fats and soup fat. For cooking processes, such as sauteing (pan frying), or deep fat frying, it is best to use the vegetable and nut oils. These are more plentiful, and hence cheaper than the animal fats; the latter, however, can be produced in the home from the fats of meats and leftover pan fats, which should not be overlooked as frying mediums. Butter and butter substitutes are best kept for table use and for flavoring. The hydrogenated oils, home rendered fats, lard and beef and mutton suet can be used for shortening fats. In the purchase of meats, the careful housewife should see that the butcher gives her all the fat she pays for, as all fats can be rendered very easily at home and can be used for cooking purposes. Butchers usually leave as large a proportion of fat as possible on all cuts of meat which, when paid for at meat prices, are quite an expensive item. All good clear fat should, therefore, be carefully trimmed from meats before cooking. Few people either like or find digestible greasy, fat meats, and the fat paid for at meat prices, which could have been rendered and used for cooking, is wasted when sent to table. There are various methods of conserving fat. First, the economical use of table fats; second, the saving of cooking; and third, the proper use of all types of fat. Economy in the use of table fats may best be secured by careful serving. One serving of butter is a little thing there are about sixty four of them in a pound. In many households the butter left on the plates probably would equal a serving or one fourth of an ounce, daily, which is usually scraped into the garbage pail or washed off in the dishpan. But if everyone of our 20,000,000 households should waste one fourth of an ounce of butter daily, it would mean 312,500 pounds a day, or 114,062,500 pounds a year. To make this butter would take 265,261,560 gallons of milk, or the product of over a half million cows, an item in national economy which should not be overlooked. When butter is used to flavor cooked vegetables, it is more economical to add it just before they are served rather than while they are cooking. The flavor thus imparted is more pronounced, and, moreover, if the butter is added before cooking, much of it will be lost in the water unless the latter is served with the vegetables. Butter substitutes, such as oleomargarine and nut margarine, should be more largely used for the table, especially for adults. Conserve butter for children, as animal fats contain vitamines necessary for growing tissues. Butter substitutes are as digestible and as nourishing as butter, and have a higher melting point. They keep better and cost less. Oleomargarine, which has been in existence for fifty years, was first offered to the world in 1870 by a famous French chemist, Mege Mouries, who was in search of a butter substitute cheap enough to supply the masses with the much needed food element. He had noticed that the children of the poor families were afflicted with rickets and other diseases which could be remedied by the administration of the right amount of fat. He combined fresh suet and milk and called the product \"oleomargarine.\" In the United States this product is now made of oleo oil or soft beef fat, neutral lard, cottonseed and other oils, churned with a small quantity of milk, and in the finer grades, cream is sometimes used. A certain proportion of butter is usually added, and the whole worked up with salt as in ordinary butter making. Owing to the fears of the butter makers that oleomargarine would supplant their product in popular favor, legislation was enacted that restricted the manufacture of oleo and established a rigid system of governmental inspection, so that the product is now manufactured under the most sanitary conditions which furnishes a cleaner and more reliable product than natural butter. Nut margarine is a compound of cocoa oil, which so closely resembles butter that only an expert can distinguish it from the natural product. Both these butter substitutes are used in large amounts by the best bakers, confectioners and biscuit manufacturers, and foolish prejudice against butter substitutes should not deter their use in the home. A large saving in cooking fats can be made by the careful utilization of all fats that come into the home. Beef and mutton suet can be rendered and made available. Fats which have been saved after meals are cooked should be clarified that is, freed from all objectionable odors, tastes or color so as to be made available as shortening and frying fats. The following recipes and suggestions make possible the use of all fats, and as fat shortage is one of the most serious of the world's food problems, it is essential that every housekeeper have a larger knowledge of the utilization and economy of this essential food. [Illustration] TO RENDER FATS TO RENDER FAT BY DIRECT METHOD Run the fat through the household meat grinder or chop fine in the chopping bowl. Then heat in the double boiler until completely melted, finally straining through a rather thick cloth or two thicknesses of cheese cloth, wrung out in hot water. By this method there is no danger of scorching. Fats heated at a low temperature also keep better than those melted at higher temperature. After the fat is rendered, it should be slowly reheated to sterilize it and make sure it is free from moisture. The bits of tissue strained out, commonly known as cracklings, may be used for shortening purposes or may be added to cornmeal which is to be used as fried cornmeal mush. TO RENDER FAT WITH MILK To two pounds of fat (finely chopped if unrendered) add one half pint of milk, preferably sour. Heat the mixture in a double boiler until thoroughly melted. Stir well and strain through a thick cloth or two thicknesses of cheese cloth wrung out in hot water. When cold the fat forms a hard, clean layer and any material adhering to the under side of the fat, may be scraped off. Sour milk being coagulated is preferable to sweet milk since the curd remains on the cloth through which the rendered mixture is strained and is thus more easily separated from the rendered fat which has acquired some of the milk flavor and butter fat. TO RENDER FAT BY COLD WATER METHOD Cut fat in small pieces. Cover with cold water. Heat slowly. Let cook until bubbling ceases. Press fat during heating so as to obtain all the oil possible. When boiling ceases strain through cheesecloth and let harden. If desired one half teaspoon salt, one eighth teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon onion and 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning may be added before straining. TO RENDER STRONG FLAVORED FATS To mutton, duck or goose fat add equal amount of beef suet or vegetable fat and render same as suet. This may then be used for shortening, or pan broiling for meat or fish dishes, and not have the characteristic taste of the stronger fats. When rendering strong mutton, duck or goose fats if a small whole onion is added the strong flavor of the fat is reduced. Remove the onion before straining. It may be used in cooking. TO CLARIFY FAT Melt the fat in an equal volume of water and heat for a short time at a moderate temperature. Stir occasionally. Cool and remove the layer of fat which forms on the top, scraping off any bits of meat or other material which may adhere to the other side. Fats which have formed on top of soups, of cooked meats (such as pot roast, stews), salt meats (such as corned beef, ham, etc.), or strong fats, such as from boiled mutton, poultry and game, may be clarified in this way and used alone or combined with other animal or vegetable fats in any savory dish. CARE OF FAT AFTER BEING USED FOR COOKING If fat is used for deep fat frying as croquettes, doughnuts, fritters, etc., while fat is still hot, add a few slices raw potato and allow it to stay in the fat until it is cool. Remove potato strain fat, allow to harden and it is ready to use. The potato absorbs odors from fat. HOW TO MAKE SAVORY FATS FAT 1: To 1 pound of unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 slice of onion about one half inch thick and two inches in diameter, 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoonful salt, and about one eighth teaspoonful of pepper. Render in a double boiler and strain. FAT 2: To 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 2 teaspoonfuls of thyme, 1 slice onion, about one half inch thick and two inches in diameter, one teaspoonful salt and about one eighth teaspoonful pepper. Render in a double boiler and strain. FAT 3: To 1 pound unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 teaspoonful thyme, 1 teaspoonful marjoram, one half teaspoonful rubbed sage, 1 teaspoonful salt, and about one eighth teaspoonful pepper. Render in a double boiler and strain through fine cloth. EXTENSION OF TABLE FATS A. Butter or other fat may be extended to double its original bulk and reduce the cost of the fat 40 per cent. A patented churn, any homemade churn, mayonnaise mixer, or bowl and rotary beater may be used for the purpose. To any quantity of butter heated until slightly soft add equal quantity of milk, place in the churn, add one teaspoon salt for each one pound of butter used. Blend thoroughly in churn, mayonnaise mixer, or in bowl with rotary beater until of even consistency. Place in refrigerator to harden. Vegetable coloring, such as comes with margarine or may be purchased separately, may be added if a deeper yellow color is desired. B. 1 lb. butter 1 quart milk (2 pint bottles preferred) 1 tablespoon granulated gelatine 1 1/2 teaspoons salt Soak gelatine in one half cup of the milk. When softened, dissolve over hot water. Let butter stand in warm place, until soft. Add gelatine mixture, milk and salt and beat with Dover beater until thoroughly mixed (about 15 minutes). Vegetable coloring such as comes with margarine may be added if desired. Do not put on ice. C. 1 lb. butter 1 quart milk (2 pint bottles preferred) 1 tablespoon granulated gelatine 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cup peanut butter Soak gelatine in one half cup of the milk. When softened, dissolve over hot water. Let butter stand in warm place, until soft. Add gelatine mixture, peanut butter, milk and salt and beat with rotary egg beater until thoroughly blended (about 15 minutes). Vegetable coloring such as comes with margarine may be added if desired. Put in cool place to harden but do not put on ice as the gelatine would cause the mixture to flake. It is preferable to make up this mixture enough for one day at a time only. D. To 1 pound of butter or butter substitute add one cup peanut butter. Blend thoroughly with wooden spoon or butter paddle; this may be used in place of butter as a new and delightful variation. E. To 1 pound softened butter add 1 pound softened butter substitute (oleomargarine, nut margarine, vegetable margarine) or hydrogenated fat. Blend thoroughly with butter paddle or wooden spoon and use as butter. SUGGESTIONS FOR PASTRY Whole wheat makes a more tasty crust than bread flour and all rye pastry has even better flavor than wheat flour pastry. Half wheat or rye and the other half cornmeal (white or yellow) makes an excellent pastry for meat or fish pie. If cornmeal is added, use this recipe: CORNMEAL PASTRY FOR MEAT OR FISH 1/2 cup cornmeal 1/2 cup rye or wheat flour 2 tablespoons fat 1/3 cup cold or ice water 1 teaspoon baking powder Sift dry ingredients. Cut in fat. Add water and roll out on well floured board. PASTRY MADE WITH DRIPPING Well made, digestible pastry should have a minimum of fat to make a crisp flaky crust. It should be crisp, not brittle; firm, not crumbly. Pastry may be made in large amounts, kept in refrigerator for several days and used as needed. Roll out only enough for one crust at a time as the less pastry is handled, the better. PLAIN PASTRY 1 cup flour 1/3 cup fat 1/2 teaspoon salt About 1/4 cup cold or ice water Mix flour and salt. Cut in fat and add just enough cold or ice water to make the mixture into a stiff dough. Roll out. This recipe makes one crust. MEAT OR FISH PIE CRUST 2 cups flour 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/3 cup any kind of dripping 1 cup meat stock or milk 1 teaspoon salt Sift dry ingredients. Cut in fat if solid, or add if liquid. Stir in meat stock or milk to make a soft dough. Place on top of meat or fish with gravy in greased baking dish and bake 30 to 40 minutes in moderately hot oven. VARIOUS USES FOR LEFTOVER FATS CREOLE RICE 2 tablespoons savory drippings 3 tablespoons flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cayenne 1 1/2 cups tomato juice and pulp 1 teaspoon onion juice 2 tablespoons chopped green pepper 1 tablespoon chopped olives 1 cup of rice 1 cup water Wash rice and soak in water 30 minutes. Melt fat, add dry ingredients and gradually the tomatoes. Stir in rice and other ingredients, also the water in which rice was soaked. Cook slowly one half hour or until rice is tender. POTATOES ESPAGNOLE 2 cups pared and sliced potatoes 2 tablespoons bacon drippings 2 tablespoons minced onion 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 tablespoon cayenne 1 1/2 cups boiling water 1 tablespoon chopped green pepper or pimento Melt drippings. Add onion and cook until slightly brown. Add other seasonings and water. Pour over potatoes. Let cook slowly in oven until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. DUMPLINGS 2 cups flour 1 teaspoon salt 4 teaspoons baking powder 2 tablespoons drippings 1 cup water, meat stock or milk Sift dry ingredients. Cut in fat. Gradually add liquid to make a soft dough. Roll out, place on greased pan and steam 20 minutes, or drop into stew and cook covered 30 minutes. Serve at once. POTATO SALAD 2 cups freshly cooked and diced potatoes 1/3 cup bacon drippings 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons chopped peppers 2 tablespoons vinegar 1/8 teaspoon cayenne Mix drippings, salt, pepper, vinegar and cayenne. Add to the potatoes and mix thoroughly. Chill and serve. Cold cooked potatoes may be used, but the flavor is better if mixed while potatoes are hot. SOAP 1 can lye 6 lbs. fat (Fat for soap should be fat which is no longer useful for culinary purposes.) 1 quart cold water To lye add water using enamel or agate utensil. When cool add the fat which has been heated until liquid. Stir until of consistency of honey (about 20 minutes). Two tablespoons ammonia or two tablespoons borax may be added for a whiter soap. If stirred thoroughly this soap will float. [Illustration: The illustration shows various forms of food waste the discarded outside leaves of lettuce and cabbage, apple cores and parings, stale bread and drippings.] SAVE FOOD _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US NOT TO WASTE FOOD, WITH PRACTICAL RECIPES ON THE USE OF LEFTOVERS_ Elimination of food waste is to day a patriotic service. It is also a most effective method of solving our food problem. This country, like all the powers at war, will undoubtedly be called upon to face increasing prices so long as the war continues, and waste in any form is not only needless squandering of the family income, but failure in devotion to a great cause. Food waste is due to poor selection of raw materials, to careless storage and heedless preparation, to bad cooking, to injudicious serving, and to the overflowing garbage pail. To select food in such a way as will eliminate waste and at the same time insure the best possible return for money spent, the housekeeper must purchase for nutriment rather than to please her own or the family palate. When eggs are sixty and seventy cents a dozen their price is out of all proportion to their food value. Tomatoes at five or ten cents apiece in winter do not supply sufficient nutriment to warrant their cost, nor does capon at forty five cents a pound nourish the body any better than the fricassee fowl at twenty eight cents. In order to prevent such costly purchasing, a knowledge of food values is necessary. The simplest and easiest way to plan food values is to divide the common food materials into five main groups and see that each of these groups appear in each day's menu. GROUP 1. FOODS DEPENDED ON FOR MINERAL MATTERS, VEGETABLE ACIDS, AND BODY REGULATING SUBSTANCES. FRUITS Apples, pears, etc., Berries, Melons, Oranges, lemons, all citrus fruits. VEGETABLES Salads, lettuce, celery, Potherbs or \"greens\" Tomatoes, squash, Green peas, green beans, Potatoes and root vegetables. GROUP 2. FOODS DEPENDED ON FOR PROTEIN. Milk, skim milk, cheese, Eggs, Meat, Poultry, Fish, Dried peas, beans, cow peas, Nuts. GROUP 3. FOODS DEPENDED ON FOR STARCH. Cereals, grains, meals, flour, Cereal breakfast foods, Bread, Crackers, Macaroni and other pastes, Cakes, cookies, starchy puddings, Potatoes, other starchy vegetables, Bananas. GROUP 4. FOODS DEPENDED ON FOR SUGAR. Sugar, Molasses, Syrups, Dates, Raisins, Figs. GROUP 5. FOODS DEPENDED ON FOR FAT. Butter and cream, Lard, suet, Salt pork and bacon, Table and salad oils, Vegetable, nut, and commercial cooking fats and oils. If from each of these groups the housekeeper, when buying, chooses the lowest cost food, she will provide the necessary nutriment for the least expenditure of money. In war time such marketing is essential. Other causes of waste in food purchasing may be enumerated as follows: Ordering by telephone. This permits the butcher or grocer, who has no time to make selection of foods, to send what comes ready to hand; whereas if the housekeeper did her own selecting, she could take advantage of special prices or \"leaders\" food sold at cost or nearly cost to attract patronage. Buying out of season foods also makes marketing costly. Through lack of knowledge concerning the periods at which certain fruits and vegetables are seasonable, and therefore cheaper and in best flavor, housekeepers frequently pay exorbitant prices for poor flavored, inferior products. Buying in localities where high rental and neighborhood standards compel the shopkeeper to charge high prices, the consumer pays not only for the rent and the plate glass windows, but for display of out of season delicacies, game and luxury foods. Markets should be selected where food in season is sold; where cleanliness and careful attention prevail rather than showy display. Many a dollar is foolishly spent for delicatessen foods. The retail cost of ready prepared foods includes a fraction of the salary of the cook and the fuel, as well as the regular percentage of profit. The food, also, is not so nourishing or flavorsome as if freshly cooked in the home kitchen. Buying perishable foods in larger quantities than can be used immediately. Too frequently meats, fish, eggs, vegetables, milk and cream are purchased in quantities larger than needed for immediate consumption, and lack of knowledge of use of left overs causes what is not eaten to be discarded. Buying non perishable foods in small quantities instead of in bulk. Food costs on an average 50 to 75 per cent. more when purchased in small quantities. Select a grocer who keeps his goods in sanitary condition and who will sell in bulk; then do your purchasing from him on a large scale and extend the sanitary care to your own storeroom. Buying foods high in price but low in food value. Asparagus, canned or fresh, is not as nourishing, for instance, as canned corn or beans. Strawberries out of season do not compare with dates, figs or raisins which are to be had at all times. Buying without planning menus. By this carelessness foods are often purchased which do not combine well, and therefore do not appeal to the appetite, and so are wasted. Unplanned meals also lead to an unconscious extravagance in buying and an unnecessary accumulation of left overs. Buying foreign brands when domestic brands are cheaper and often better. Leaving the trimmings from meats and poultry at the butcher's. Bring these home and fry out the fatty portions for dripping; use all other parts for the stock pot. Having purchased for nutriment and in sufficiently large quantities to secure bulk rates, careful storage is the next step in the prevention of waste. Flour, cereals and meals become wormy if they are not kept in clean, covered utensils and in a cool place. Milk becomes sour, especially in summer. This can be prevented by scalding it as soon as received, cooling quickly, and storing in a cold place in covered, well scalded receptacles. Sour milk should not be thrown out. It is good in biscuits, gingerbread, salad dressings, cottage cheese, pancakes or waffles, and bread making. Meats should not be left in their wrappings. Much juice soaks into the paper, which causes a loss of flavor and nutriment. Store all meat in a cool place and do not let flies come in contact with it. Bread often molds, especially in warm, moist weather. Trim off moldy spots and heat through. Keep the bread box sweet by scalding and sunning once a week. Cheese molds. Keep in a cool, dry place. If it becomes too dry for table use, grate for sauces or use in scalloped dishes. Winter vegetables wilt and dry out. Store in a cool place. If cellar space permits, place in box of sand, sawdust or garden earth. Potatoes and onions sprout. Cut off the sprouts as soon as they appear and use for soup. Soak, before using, vegetables which have sprouted. Fruits must be stored carefully so as to keep the skins unbroken. Broken spots in the skin cause rapid decay. Do not permit good fruit to remain in contact with specked or rotted fruit. Stored fruit should be looked over frequently and all specked or rotted fruit removed. Sweet potatoes are an exception. Picking over, aggravates the trouble. See that these vegetables are carefully handled at all times; if rot develops, remove only those that can be reached without danger of bruising the sound roots. Sweet potatoes may also be stored like fruit by spreading over a large surface and separating the tubers so that they do not touch each other. Berries should be picked over as soon as received and spread on a platter or a large surface to prevent crushing and to allow room for circulation of air. Lettuce and greens wilt. Wash carefully as soon as received and use the coarse leaves for soup. Shake the water from the crisp portions and store in a paper bag in a cold refrigerator. Lemons when cut often grow moldy before they are used. When lemons are spoiling, squeeze out the juice, make a syrup of one cup of sugar and one cup of water, boil ten minutes and add lemon juice in any amount up to one cup. Bring to boiling point and bottle for future use. This bottled juice may be used for puddings, beverages, etc. If only a small amount of juice is needed, prick one end of a lemon with a fork. Squeeze out the amount needed and store the lemon in the ice box. When we come to waste caused by careless preparation we may be reminded of the miracle of the loaves and fishes how all the guests were fed and then twelve baskets were gathered up. Often after preparation that which is gathered up to be thrown away is as large in quantity and as high in food value as the portions used. Vegetables are wasted in preparation by too thick paring, the discarding of coarse leaves such as are found on lettuce, cabbage and cauliflower, discarding wilted parts which can be saved by soaking, throwing away tips and roots of celery and the roots and ends of spinach and dandelions. All these waste products can be cooked tender, rubbed through a sieve and used with stock for vegetable soup, or with skimmed milk for cream soup. Such products are being conserved by the enemy, even to the onion skin, which is ground into bread making material. Throwing away the water in which vegetables have been cooked wastes their characteristic and valuable element the mineral salts. Cooking them so much that they become watery; under cooking so that they are hard and indigestible; cooking more than is required for a meal; failing to use left over portions promptly as an entree or for cream soups or scalloped dishes all these things mean an appalling waste of valuable food material. Good food material is also lost when the water in which rice or macaroni or other starchy food has been boiled is poured down the kitchen sink. Such water should be used for soup making. Fruits are wasted by throwing away the cores and skins, which can be used for making sauces, jams and jellies, the latter being sweetened with corn syrup instead of sugar. Rhubarb is wasted by removing the pink skin from young rhubarb, which should be retained to add flavor and color attractiveness to the dish. Raw food in quantity is frequently left in the mixing bowl, while by the use of a good flexible knife or spatula every particle can be saved. A large palette knife is as good in the kitchen as in the studio. * * * * * The next step in food preparation is cooking, and tons of valuable material are wasted through ignorance of the principles of cooking. Bad cooking, which means under cooking, over cooking or flavorless cooking, renders food inedible, and inedible food contributes to world shortage. Fats are wasted in cooking by being burned and by not being carefully utilized as dripping and shortening. The water in which salt meat, fresh meat, or poultry has been boiled should be allowed to cool and the fat removed before soup is made of it. Such fat can be used, first of all, in cooking, and then any inedible portions can be used in soap making. * * * * * Tough odds and ends of meat not sightly enough to appear on the table are often wasted. They can be transformed by long cooking into savory stews, ragouts, croquettes and hashes, whereas, if carelessly and insufficiently cooked, they are unpalatable and indigestible. Scraps of left over cooked meat should be ground in the food chopper and made into appetizing meat balls, hashes or sandwich paste. If you happen to have a soft cooked egg left over, boil it hard at once. It can be used for garnishes, sauces, salads or sandwich paste. * * * * * Use all bits of bread, that cannot be used as toast, in puddings, croquettes, scalloped dishes or to thicken soup. * * * * * Don't throw away cold muffins and fancy breads. Split and toast them for next day's breakfast. * * * * * Foods that survive the earlier forms of waste are often lost at table by the serving of portions of like size to all members of the family. The individual food requirements differ according to age, sex, vocation and state of health. Each should be considered before the food is served, then there will be no waste on the plates when the meal is over. The following table, showing the daily requirement of calories for men and women in various lines of work, illustrates this point: WOMEN CALORIES Sedentary work ... 2,400 Active work ... 2,700 Hard manual labor... 3,200 MEN CALORIES Sedentary work ... 2,700 Active work ... 3,450 Hard manual labor... 4,150 Although the serving of food should be carefully planned so as to prevent waste, care should be taken that growing children have ample food. It is a mistake to suppose that a growing child can be nourished on less than a sedentary adult. A boy of fourteen who wants to eat more than his father probably needs all that he asks for. We must not save on the children; but it will be well to give them plain food for the most part, which will not tempt them to overeat, and tactfully combat pernickety, overfastidious likes and dislikes. The United States Food Administration is preaching the gospel of the clean plate, and this can be accomplished by serving smaller portions, insisting that all food accepted be eaten; by keeping down bread waste, cutting the bread at the table a slice at a time as needed; by cooking only sufficient to supply moderately the number to be fed, and no more. It is a false idea of good providing that platters must leave the table with a generous left over. Waste of cooked food is a serious item in household economy, and no matter how skillfully leftovers are utilized, it is always less expensive and more appetizing to provide fresh cooked foods at each meal. One would think that with the various uses to which all kinds of foodstuffs may be put that there would be little left for the yawning garbage pail. But the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture is responsible for the statement that $750,000,000 worth of food has been wasted annually in the American kitchen. Undoubtedly a large part of this wastefulness was due to ignorance on the part of the housewife, and the rest of it to the lack of co operation on the part of the employees who have handled the food but not paid the bills. According to a well known domestic scientist, the only things which should find their way to the garbage pail are: Egg shells after being used to clear coffee. Potato skins after having been cooked on the potato. Banana skins if there are no tan shoes to be cleaned. Bones after having been boiled in soup kettle. Coffee grounds if there is no garden where they can be used for fertilizer, or if they are not desired as filling for pincushions. Tea leaves after every tea serving, if they are not needed for brightening carpets or rugs when swept. Asparagus ends after being cooked and drained for soup. Spinach, etc. decayed leaves and dirty ends of roots. If more than this is now thrown away, you are wasting the family income and not fulfilling your part in the great world struggle. Your government says that it is your business to know what food your family needs to be efficient; that you must learn how to make the most of the foods you buy; that it is your duty to learn the nature and uses of various foods and to get the greatest possible nourishment out of every pound of food that comes to your home. The art of utilizing left overs is an important factor in this prevention of waste. The thrifty have always known it. The careless have always ignored it. But now as a measure of home economy as well as a patriotic service, the left over must be handled intelligently. The following recipes show how to make appetizing dishes from products that heretofore in many homes have found their way to the extravagant pail. In these recipes, sauces are prominent because they are of great value in making foods of neutral flavor, especially the starchy winter vegetables, and rice, macaroni and hominy, as attractive as they are nutritious; salads are included, since these serve to combine odds and ends of meats and vegetables; gelatine dishes are provided because gelatine serves as a binder for all kinds of leftovers and is an extremely practical way of making the most rigid saving acceptable; desserts made of crumbs of bread and cake, or left over cereals, are among the major economies if they are worked out in such a way that they do not involve the extravagant use of other foodstuffs. All the recipes in this economy cook book have been thoughtfully adapted to the conditions of the time, and will show the practical housekeeper how to supply wholesome, flavorsome food for the least cost. * * * * * SAUCES MAKE LEFTOVERS ATTRACTIVE WHITE SAUCE 1/4 cup flour 1/4 cup fat 1 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon cayenne 1 1/2 cups milk Melt fat.

SOUPS UTILIZE LEFTOVERS In nearly every case when meat is purchased, some bone is paid for. Too frequently this is either left at the market or thrown away in the home. Bones, gristle, tough ends, head and feet of chickens, head, fins and bones of fish, etc., should be utilized for making soup. If a meat or fish chowder with plenty of vegetable accompaniment is served, no other meat is required for the usual home meal. If a cream of dried or fresh vegetables, or a meat stock soup with plenty of vegetables or cereal content, is served, the amount of meat eaten with the main course of the meal will be materially lessened. Soups may be a most economical method of using water in which meat, fish or vegetables have been cooked; also of utilizing small portions of leftover meats, fish, vegetables or cereal. Cream soups are made by cooking vegetables or cereal, then utilizing the water in which they are cooked as part of the liquid for the soup. Outer parts or wilted parts of vegetables may be utilized for soups instead of being discarded. Water in which ham or mutton has been boiled makes an excellent basis for dried or fresh vegetable soups. In fact, soup can be made from all kinds of leftovers the variety and kind make little difference so long as the mixture is allowed to simmer for several hours and is properly seasoned. CREAM SOUP 1/3 cup fat 1/3 cup flour 1 teaspoon salt 1 cup cereal or vegetable 1/4 teaspoon cayenne 1 pt. milk 1 pt. water, in which vegetable or cereal was cooked, or leftover water in which meat was cooked.

SAVE AND SERVE TO SAVE BREAD. Serve bread or rolls made from corn, rye or from coarse flours. Use breakfast foods and hot cakes, composed of corn, oatmeal, buckwheat, rice or hominy. Serve no toast as garniture or under meat. Serve war breads. Use every part of the bread, either fresh or stale, for puddings and toast; or dried and sifted for baked croquettes; or use to extend flour in the making of muffins and drop cakes. TO SAVE MEAT. Use more chicken, hare, rabbits, duck, goose, lobster, oysters, clams and egg and cheese dishes of all kinds. Use less beef, mutton, and pork and serve smaller portions at table of these meats. Have fewer of these items on the menu. Provide more entrees and made over dishes in which a smaller quantity of meat is extended by the use of potatoes, rice, hominy, etc. Use beans, as they contain nearly the same nutritive value as meat. Serve bacon only as a dish and not as a garniture, and this way not more than once a week. Use cheese, dried vegetables and nuts. Use fish and meat chowders. Use meat extension dishes. Serve vegetable dinners. TO SAVE SUGAR. Use less candy and sweet drinks. Use honey, maple sugar, corn syrup, molasses and dark syrups with hot cakes and waffles and in all cooking, in order to save butter and sugar. Use all classes of fruit preserves, jam, marmalades and jellies. Do not frost or ice cakes. Serve dried fruits with cereals, and no sugar is needed. TO SAVE FATS. Serve as few fried dishes as possible, so as to save both butter and lard, and in any event use vegetable oils for frying that is, olive oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, vegetable oil compounds, etc. Trim all coarse fats from meats before cooking and use the waste fats for shortening and for soap. We are short of soap fats as our supplies of tropical oils used for soap making are reduced. Do not waste soap. Save fat from soup stock and from boiled meats. Use butter substitutes where possible. TO SAVE MILK. Use it all. Buy whole milk and let cream rise. Use this cream, and you secure your milk without cost. Economize on milk and cream except for children. Serve buttermilk. Serve cottage cheese regularly in varying forms. It is especially nutritious. Use skimmed milk in cooking. A great quantity of it goes to waste in this country. Use cheese generally. The children must have milk whole, therefore reduce the use of cream. USE VEGETABLES. Use more vegetables and potatoes. Make fruits and vegetables into salads and attractive dishes. Feature vegetable dinners and salads of all kinds. Encourage the use of cheese with salads. Make all types of salads from vegetables. We have a great surplus of vegetables, and they can be used by substituting them for staples so that the staples most needed will be saved. Make all kinds of vegetable soups, especially the cream soups, in which the waste from staple vegetables, such as outer leaves and wilted parts, can be utilized. These are wholesome and nutritious and save meat. ",

        "What are you giving so that others may live? _Eat less_ WHEAT MEAT FATS SUGAR Send more to Europe or they will Starve] FOREWORD Food will win the war, and the nation whose food resources are best conserved will be the victor.",
        "This is the truth that our government is trying to drive home to every man, woman and child in America.",
        "We have always been happy in the fact that ours was the richest nation in the world, possessing unlimited supplies of food, fuel, energy and ability; but rich as these resources are they will not meet the present food shortage unless every family and every individual enthusiastically co operates in the national saving campaign as outlined by the United States Food Administration.",
        "The regulations prescribed for this saving campaign are simple and easy of application.",
        "Our government does not ask us to give up three square meals a day nor even one.",
        "All it asks is that we substitute as far as possible corn and other cereals for wheat, reduce a little our meat consumption and save sugar and fats by careful utilization of these products.",
        "There are few housekeepers who are not eager to help in this saving campaign, and there are few indeed who do not feel the need of conserving family resources.",
        "But just how is sometimes a difficult task.",
        "This book is planned to solve the housekeeper's problem.",
        "It shows how to substitute cereals and other grains for wheat, how to cut down the meat bill by the use of meat extension and meat substitute dishes which supply equivalent nutrition at much less cost; it shows the use of syrup and other products that save sugar, and it explains how to utilize all kinds of fats.",
        "It contains 47 recipes for the making of war breads; 64 recipes on low cost meat dishes and meat substitutes; 54 recipes for sugarless desserts; menus for meatless and wheatless days, methods of purchasing in all some two hundred ways of meeting present food conditions at minimum cost and without the sacrifice of nutrition.",
        "Not only have its authors planned to help the woman in the home, conserve the family income, but to encourage those saving habits which must be acquired by this nation if we are to secure a permanent peace that will insure the world against another onslaught by the Prussian military powers.",
        "A little bit of saving in food means a tremendous aggregate total, when 100,000,000 people are doing the saving.",
        "One wheatless meal a day would not mean hardship; there are always corn and other products to be used.",
        "Yet one wheatless meal a day in every family would mean a saving of 90,000,000 bushels of wheat, which totals 5,400,000,000 lbs.",
        "Two meatless days a week would mean a saving of 2,200,000 lbs.",
        "of meat per annum.",
        "One teaspoonful of sugar per person saved each day would insure a supply ample to take care of our soldiers and our Allies.",

        "Yet one good sized slice of bread weighs an ounce.",
        "It contains almost three fourths of an ounce of flour.",
        "If every one of the country's 20,000,000 homes wastes on the average only one such slice of bread a day, the country is throwing away daily over 14,000,000 ounces of flour over 875,000 pounds, or enough flour for over a million one pound loaves a day.",
        "For a full year at this rate there would be a waste of over 319,000,000 pounds of flour 1,500,000 barrels enough flour to make 365,000,000 loaves.",
        "As it takes four and one half bushels of wheat to make a barrel of ordinary flour, this waste would represent the flour from over 7,000,000 bushels of wheat.",
        "Fourteen and nine tenths bushels of wheat on the average are raised per acre.",
        "It would take the product of some 470,000 acres just to provide a single slice of bread to be wasted daily in every home.",
        "But some one says, \"a full slice of bread is not wasted in every home.\" Very well, make it a daily slice for every four or every ten or every thirty homes make it a weekly or monthly slice in every home or make the wasted slice thinner.",
        "The waste of flour involved is still appalling.",
        "These are figures compiled by government experts, and they should give pause to every housekeeper who permits a slice of bread to be wasted in her home.",
        "Another source of waste of which few of us take account is home made bread.",
        "Sixty per cent.",
        "of the bread used in America is made in the home.",
        "When one stops to consider how much home made bread is poorly made, and represents a large waste of flour, yeast and fuel, this housewifely energy is not so commendable.",
        "The bread flour used in the home is also in the main wheat flour, and all waste of wheat at the present time increases the shortage of this most necessary food.",
        "Fuel, too, is a serious national problem, and all coal used in either range, gas, or electric oven for the baking of poor bread is an actual national loss.",
        "There must be no waste in poor baking or from poor care after the bread is made, or from the waste of a crust or crumb.",
        "Waste in your kitchen means starvation in some other kitchen across the sea.",
        "Our Allies are asking for 450,000,000 bushels of wheat, and we are told that even then theirs will be a privation loaf.",
        "Crop shortage and unusual demand has left Canada and the United States, which are the largest sources of wheat, with but 300,000,000 bushels available for export.",
        "The deficit must be met by reducing consumption on this side the Atlantic.",
        "This can be done by eliminating waste and by making use of cereals and flours other than wheat in bread making.",
        "The wide use of wheat flour for bread making has been due to custom.",
        "In Europe rye and oats form the staple breads of many countries, and in some sections of the South corn bread is the staff of life.",
        "We have only to modify a little our bread eating habits in order to meet the present need.",
        "Other cereals can well be used to eke out the wheat, but they require slightly different handling.",
        "In making yeast breads, the essential ingredient is gluten, which is extended by carbon dioxide gas formed by yeast growth.",
        "With the exception of rye, grains other than wheat do not contain sufficient gluten for yeast bread, and it is necessary to use a wheat in varying proportions in order to supply the deficient gluten.",
        "Even the baker's rye loaf is usually made of one half rye and one half wheat.",
        "This is the safest proportion for home use in order to secure a good texture.",
        "When oatmeal is used, it is necessary to scald the oatmeal to prevent a raw taste.",
        "Oatmeal also makes a softer dough than wheat, and it is best to make the loaf smaller and bake it longer: about one hour instead of the forty five minutes which we allow for wheat bread.",
        "The addition of one third barley flour to wheat flour makes a light colored, good flavored bread.",
        "If a larger proportion than this is used, the loaf has a decided barley flavor.",
        "If you like this flavor and increase the proportion of barley, be sure to allow the dough a little longer time to rise, as by increasing the barley you weaken the gluten content of your loaf.",
        "Rice and cornmeal can be added to wheat breads in a 10 per cent.",
        "proportion.",
        "Laboratory tests have shown that any greater proportion than this produces a heavy, small loaf.",

        "of potato, but this makes a darker and moister loaf than when wheat alone is used.",
        "In order to take care of this moisture, it is best to reserve part of the wheat for the second kneading.",
        "Graham and entire wheat flour also effect a saving of wheat because a larger percentage of the wheat berry is used.",
        "Graham flour is the whole kernel of wheat, ground.",
        "Entire wheat flour is the flour resulting from the grinding of all but the outer layer of wheat.",
        "A larger use of these coarser flours will therefore help materially in eking out our scant wheat supply as the percentage of the wheat berry used for bread flour is but 72 per cent.",
        "Breads made from these coarser flours also aid digestion and are a valuable addition to the dietary.",
        "In order to keep down waste by eliminating the poor batch of bread, it is necessary to understand the principles of bread making.",
        "Fermentation is the basic principle of yeast bread, and fermentation is controlled by temperature.",
        "The yeast plant grows at a temperature from 70 to 90 degrees (Fahrenheit), and if care is taken to maintain this temperature during the process of fermentation, waste caused by sour dough or over fermentation will be eliminated.",
        "When we control the temperature we can also reduce the time necessary for making a loaf of bread, or several loaves of bread as may be needed, into as short a period as three hours.",
        "This is what is known as the quick method.",
        "It not only saves time and labor, but, controlling the temperature, insures accurate results.",
        "The easiest way to control the temperature is to put the bowl containing the dough into another of slightly larger size containing water at a temperature of 90 degrees.",
        "The water of course should never be hot.",
        "Hot water kills the yeast plant.",
        "Cold water checks its growth.",
        "Cover the bowl and set it in the gas oven or fireless cooker or on the shelf of the coal range.",
        "As the water in the large bowl cools off, remove a cupful and add a cupful of hot water.",
        "At the end of one and one half hours the dough should have doubled in bulk.",
        "Take it out of the pan and knead until the large gas bubbles are broken (about ten minutes).",
        "Then place in greased bread pans and allow to rise for another half hour.",
        "At the end of this time it will not only fill the pan, but will project out of it.",
        "Do not allow the dough to rise too high, for then the bread will have large holes in it.",
        "A good proportion as a general rule to follow, is: 3 1/2 cupfuls of flour (this includes added cereals) 1 cupful of water or milk 1/2 tablespoon shortening 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 cake of compressed yeast In this recipe sugar has been omitted because of the serious shortage, but after the war a teaspoon of sugar should be added.",
        "The shortening, although small in quantity, may also be omitted.",
        "These materials make a loaf of about one pound, which should be baked in forty to fifty minutes at a temperature of 450 degrees (Fahrenheit).",
        "Allow a little longer time for bread containing oatmeal or other grains.",
        "Such breads require a little longer baking and a little lower temperature than wheat breads.",
        "If you do not use a thermometer in testing your oven, place a piece of paper on the center shelf, and if it browns in two minutes your oven is right.",
        "If a longer period for raising is allowed than is suggested in the above recipe, the yeast proportion should be decreased.",
        "For overnight bread use one quarter yeast cake per loaf; for six hour bread, use one half yeast cake per loaf; for three hour bread, use one yeast cake per loaf.",
        "In baking, the time allowed should depend on the size of the loaf.",
        "When baked at a temperature of 450 degrees, large loaves take from forty five to sixty minutes, small loaves from thirty to forty minutes, rolls from ten to twenty minutes.",
        "It is well to divide the oven time into four parts.",
        "During the first quarter, the rising continues; second quarter, browning begins; the third quarter, browning is finished; the fourth quarter, bread shrinks from the side of the pan.",
        "These are always safe tests to follow in your baking.",
        "When baked, the bread should be turned out of the pans and allow to cool on a wire rack.",
        "When cool, put the bread in a stone crock or bread box.",
        "To prevent staleness, keep the old bread away from the fresh scald the bread crock or give your bread box a sun bath at frequent intervals.",
        "Even with all possible care to prevent waste, yeast breads will not conserve our wheat supply so well as quick breads, because all yeast breads need a larger percentage of wheat.",
        "The home baker can better serve her country by introducing into her menus numerous quick breads that can be made from cornmeal, rye, corn and rye, hominy, and buckwheat.",
        "Griddle cakes and waffles can also be made from lentils, soy beans, potatoes, rice and peas.",
        "Do not expect that the use of other cereals in bread making will reduce the cost of your bread.",
        "That is not the object.",
        "Saving of wheat for war needs is the thing we are striving for, and this is as much an act of loyalty as buying Liberty Bonds.",
        "It is to meet the crucial world need of bread that we are learning to substitute, and not to spare the national purse.",
        "Besides this saving of wheat, our Government also asks us to omit all fat from our yeast breads in order to conserve the diminishing fat supply.",
        "This may seem impossible to the woman who has never made bread without shortening, but recent experiments in bread making laboratories have proved that bread, without shortening, is just as light and as good in texture as that made with shortening the only difference being a slight change in flavor.",
        "These experiments have also shown that it is possible to supply shortening by the introduction of 3 per cent.",
        "to 5 per cent.",
        "of canned cocoanut or of peanut butter, and that sugar may also be omitted from bread making recipes.",
        "In fact, the war is bringing about manifold interesting experiments which prove that edible and nutritious bread can be made of many things besides the usual white flour.",
        "The recipes herewith appended, showing the use of combinations of cereals and wheat, have been carefully tested in The Forecast School of Modern Cookery.",
        "Good bread can be made from each recipe, and the new flavors obtained by the use of other grains make a pleasing and wholesome variety.",
        "A family which has eaten oatmeal or entire wheat bread will never again be satisfied with a diet that includes only bread made from bleached flour.",
        "Children, especially, will be benefited by the change, as the breads made from coarser flours are not only more nutritious, but are rich in the minerals and vitamine elements that are so essential to the growth of strong teeth, bones and growing tissues.",
        "The homemaker, too, will never regret her larger acquaintance with bread making materials, as the greater variety of breads that she will find herself able to produce will be a source of pleasure and keen satisfaction.",

        "more meat than we require to maintain health.",
        "This statement, recently issued by the United States Food Administration, is appalling when we consider that there is a greater demand for meat in the world to day than ever before, coupled with a greatly decreased production.",
        "The increase in the demand for meat and animal products is due to the stress of the war.",
        "Millions of men are on the fighting line doing hard physical labor, and require a larger food allowance than when they were civilians.",
        "To meet the demand for meat and to save their grains, our Allies have been compelled to kill upward of thirty three million head of their stock animals, and they have thus stifled their animal production.",
        "This was burning the candle at both ends, and they now face increased demand handicapped by decreased production.",
        "America must fill the breach.",
        "Not only must we meet the present increased demand, but we must be prepared as the war advances to meet an even greater demand for this most necessary food.",
        "The way out of this serious situation is first to reduce meat consumption to the amount really needed and then to learn to use other foods that will supply the food element which is found in meat.",
        "This element is called protein, and we depend upon it to build and repair body tissues.",
        "Although most persons believe that protein can only be obtained from meat, it is found in many other foods, such as milk, skim milk, cheese, cottage cheese, poultry, eggs, fish, dried peas, beans, cow peas, lentils and nuts.",
        "For instance, pound for pound, salmon, either fresh or canned, equals round steak in protein content; cream cheese contains one quarter more protein and three times as much fat; peanuts (hulled) one quarter more protein and three and a half times as much fat; beans (dried) a little more protein and one fifth as much fat; eggs (one dozen) about the same in protein and one half more fat.",
        "It is our manifest duty to learn how to make the best use of these foods in order to save beef, pork and mutton, to be shipped across the sea.",
        "This means that the housekeeper has before her the task of training the family palate to accept new food preparations.",
        "Training the family palate is not easy, because bodies that have grown accustomed to certain food combinations find it difficult to get along without them, and rebel at a change.",
        "If these habits of diet are suddenly disturbed we may upset digestion, as well as create a feeling of dissatisfaction which is equally harmful to physical well being.",
        "The wise housekeeper will therefore make her changes gradually.",
        "In reducing meat in the diet of a family that has been used to having meat twice a day, it will be well to start out with meat once a day and keep up this r\u00e9gime for a couple of weeks.",
        "Then drop meat for a whole day, supplying in its stead a meat substitute dish that will furnish the same nutriment.",
        "After a while you can use meat substitutes at least twice a week without disturbing the family's mental or physical equilibrium.",
        "It would be well also to introduce dishes that extend the meat flavor, such as stews combined with dumplings, hominy, or rice; pot pies or short cakes with a dressing of meat and vegetables; meat loaf, souffle or croquettes in which meat is combined with bread crumbs, potato or rice.",
        "Meat eating is largely a matter of flavor.",
        "If flavor is supplied, the reduction of meat in the diet can be made with little annoyance.",
        "Nutrition can always be supplied in the other dishes that accompany the meal, as a certain proportion of protein is found in almost every food product.",
        "The meat that we use to obtain flavor in sauces and gravies need not be large in quantity, nor expensive in cut.",
        "The poor or cheap cuts have generally more flavor than the expensive ones, the difference being entirely in texture and tenderness, freedom from gristle and inedible tissue.",
        "There are many cereals, such as rice, hominy, cornmeal, samp and many vegetable dishes, especially dried beans of all kinds, that are greatly improved by the addition of meat sauce and when prepared in this way may be served as the main dish of a meal.",
        "Harvey W.",
        "Wiley has stated that the meat eating of the future will not be regarded as a necessity so much as it has been in the past, and that meat will be used more as a condimental substance.",
        "Europe has for years used meat for flavor rather than for nutriment.",
        "It would seem that the time has come for Americans to learn the use of meat for flavor and to utilize more skillfully the protein of other foods.",
        "It may be difficult to convince the meat lover that he can radically reduce the proportion of meat in his diet without detriment to health.",
        "Many persons adhere to the notion that you are not nourished unless you eat meat; that meat foods are absolutely necessary to maintain the body strength.",
        "This idea is entirely without foundation, for the foods mentioned as meat substitutes earlier in this chapter can be made to feed the world, and feed it well in fact, no nation uses so large a proportion of meat as America.",
        "The first step, therefore, in preparing ourselves to reduce meat consumption is to recognize that only a small quantity of meat is necessary to supply sufficient protein for adult life.",
        "The growing child or the youth springing into manhood needs a larger percentage of meat than the adult, and in apportioning the family's meat ration this fact should not be overlooked.",
        "The second step is to reduce the amount purchased, choosing cuts that contain the least waste, and by utilizing with care that which we do purchase.",
        "Fat, trimmings, and bones all have their uses and should be saved from the garbage pail.",
        "Careful buying, of course, depends on a knowledge of cuts, a study of the percentage of waste in each cut, and the food value of the different kinds of meat.",
        "Make a study of the different cuts, as shown in the charts on pages 36, 37, and armed with this knowledge go forth to the butcher for practical buying.",
        "Then comes the cooking, which can only be properly done when the fundamental principles of the cooking processes, such as boiling, braising, broiling, stewing, roasting and frying are understood.",
        "Each cut requires different handling to secure the maximum amount of nutriment and flavor.",
        "The waste occasioned by improper cooking is a large factor in both household and national economy.",
        "It has been estimated that a waste of an ounce each day of edible meat or fat in the twenty million American homes amounts to 456,000,000 pounds of valuable animal food a year.",
        "At average dressed weights, this amounts to 875,000 steers, or over 3,000,000 hogs.",
        "Each housekeeper, therefore, who saves her ounce a day aids in this enormous saving, which will mean so much in the feeding of our men on the fighting line.",
        "So the housekeeper who goes to her task of training the family palate to accept meat substitutes and meat economy dishes, who revolutionizes her methods of cooking so as to utilize even \"the pig's squeak,\" will be doing her bit toward making the world safe for democracy.",

        "One ounce of sugar equals two scant level tablespoonfuls and represents a saving that every man, woman and child should be able to make.",
        "Giving up soft drinks and the frosting on our cakes, the use of sugarless desserts and confections, careful measuring and thorough stirring of that which we place in our cups of tea and coffee, and the use of syrup, molasses or honey on our pancakes and fritters will more than effect this saving.",
        "It seems but a small sacrifice, if sacrifice it can be called, when one recognizes that cutting down sugar consumption will be most beneficial to national health.",
        "The United States is the largest consumer of sugar in the world.",
        "In 1916 Germany's consumption was 20 lbs.",
        "per person per year, Italy's 29 to 30 lbs., that of France 37, of England 40, while the United States averaged 85 lbs.",
        "This enormous consumption is due to the fact that we are a nation of candy eaters.",
        "We spend annually $80,000,000 on confections.",
        "These are usually eaten between meals, causing digestive disturbances as well as unwarranted expense.",
        "Sweets are a food and should be eaten at the close of the meal, and if this custom is established during the war, not only will tons of sugar be available for our Allies, but the health of the nation improved.",
        "The average daily consumption of sugar per person in this country is 5 ounces, and yet nutritional experts agree that not more than 3 ounces a day should be taken.",
        "The giving up of one ounce per day will, therefore, be of great value in reducing many prevalent American ailments.",
        "Flatulent dyspepsia, rheumatism, diabetes, and stomach acidity are only too frequently traced to an oversupply of sugar in our daily diet.",
        "Most persons apparently think of sugar merely as a sweetening agent, forgetting entirely the fact that it is a most concentrated food.",
        "It belongs to what is called the carbohydrate group, upon which we largely depend for energy and heat.",
        "It is especially valuable to the person doing active physical work, the open air worker, or the healthy, active, growing child, but should be used sparingly by other classes of people.",
        "Sugar is not only the most concentrated fuel food in the dietary, but it is one that is very readily utilized in the body, 98 per cent.",
        "of it being available for absorption, while within thirty minutes of the time it is taken into the system part of it is available for energy.",
        "As a food it must be supplied, especially to the classes of people mentioned above, but as a confection it can well be curtailed.",
        "When it is difficult to obtain, housekeepers must avail themselves of changed recipes and different combinations to supply the necessary three ounces per day and to gain the much desired sweet taste so necessary to many of our foods of neutral flavor with which sugar is usually combined.",
        "Our grandmothers knew how to prepare many dishes without sugar.",
        "In their day lack of transportation facilities, of refining methods and various economic factors made molasses, sorghum, honey, etc., the only common methods of sweetening.",
        "But the housekeeper of to day knows little of sweetening mediums except sugar, and sugar shortage is to her a crucial problem.",
        "There are many ways, however, of getting around sugar shortage and many methods of supplying the necessary food value and sweetening.",
        "By the use of marmalades, jams and jellies canned during the season when the sugar supply was less limited, necessity for the use of sugar can be vastly reduced.",
        "By the addition to desserts and cereals of dried fruits, raisins, dates, prunes and figs, which contain large amounts of natural sugar, the sugar consumption can be greatly lessened.",
        "By utilizing leftover syrup from canned or preserved fruits for sweetening other fruits, and by the use of honey, molasses, maple sugar, maple syrup and corn syrup, large quantities of sugar may be saved.",
        "The substitution of sweetened condensed milk for dairy milk in tea, coffee and cocoa in fact, in all our cooking processes where milk is required will also immeasurably aid in sugar conservation.",
        "The substitutes mentioned are all available in large amounts.",
        "Honey is especially valuable for children, as it consists of the more simple sugars which are less irritating than cane sugar, and there is no danger of acid stomach from the amounts generally consumed.",
        "As desserts are the chief factor in the use of quantities of sugar in our diet, the appended recipes will be of value, as they deal with varied forms of nutritious, attractive sugarless desserts.",
        "It is only by the one ounce savings of each individual member of our great one hundred million population that the world sugar shortage may be met, and it is hoped every housekeeper will study her own time tested recipes with the view of utilizing as far as possible other forms of sweetening.",
        "In most recipes the liquid should be slightly reduced in amount and about one fifth more of the substitute should be used than the amount of sugar called for.",
        "With a few tests along this line one will be surprised how readily the substitution may be made.",
        "If all sweetening agents become scarce, desserts can well be abandoned.",
        "Served at the end of a full meal, desserts are excess food except in the diet of children, where they should form a component part of the meal.",

        "[Illustration] SAVE FAT _REASONS WHY OUR GOVERNMENT ASKS US TO SAVE FAT, WITH PRACTICAL RECIPES FOR FAT CONSERVATION_ With the world wide decrease of animal production, animal fats are now growing so scarce that the world is being scoured for new sources of supply.",
        "Our Government has asked the housewife to conserve all the fats that come to her home and utilize them to the best advantage.",
        "To this end it is necessary to have some knowledge of the character of different fats and the purposes to which they are best adapted.",
        "The word fat usually brings to one's mind an unappetizing chunk of meat fat which most persons cannot and will not eat, and fatty foods have been popularly supposed to be \"bad for us\" and \"hard to digest.\" Fats are, however, an important food absolutely essential to complete nutrition, which repay us better for the labor of digestion than any other food.",
        "If they are indigestible, it is usually due to improper cooking or improper use; if they are expensive, it is merely because they are extravagantly handled.",
        "The chief function of fatty food is to repair and renew the fatty tissues, to yield energy and to maintain the body heat.",
        "The presence of fat in food promotes the flow of the pancreatic juice and bile, which help in the assimilation of other foods and assist the excretory functions of the intestine.",
        "These are badly performed if bile and other digestive fluids are not secreted in sufficient quantity.",
        "The absence of fat in the diet leads to a state of malnutrition, predisposing to tuberculosis, especially in children and young persons.",
        "It is claimed that the most serious food shortage in Germany is fat; that the civilian population is dying in large numbers because of the lack of it, and that Von Hindenburg's men will lose out on the basis of fat, rather than on the basis of munitions or military organization.",
        "Worst of all is the effect of fat shortage on the children of the nation.",
        "Leaders of thought all over Europe assert that even if Germany wins, Germany has lost, because it has sapped the strength of its coming generation.",
        "The term fat is used to designate all products of fatty composition and includes liquid fats such as oils, soft fats such as butter, and hard fats such as tallow.",
        "While all fats have practically the same energy value, they differ widely from each other in their melting point, and the difference in digestibility seems to correspond to the difference in melting point.",
        "Butter burns at 240 degrees Fahrenheit, while vegetable oils can be heated as high as 600 degrees Fahrenheit, furnishing a very high temperature for cooking purposes before they begin to burn.",
        "The scorching of fat not only wastes the product, but renders it indigestible, even dangerous to some people, and for this reason butter should never be used for frying, as frying temperature is usually higher than 240 degrees.",
        "It is well to choose for cooking only those fats which have the highest heat resisting qualities because they do not burn so easily.",
        "Beginning with the lowest burning point, fats include genuine butter, substitute butters, lard and its substitutes, and end with tallow and vegetable oils.",
        "Of the latter, there is a varied selection from the expensive olive oil to the cheaper cottonseed, peanut, cocoanut and corn oils and their compounds and the hydrogenated oils.",
        "The economy of fat, therefore, depends on the choice of the fat used for the various cooking processes as well as the conservation of all fatty residue, such as crackling, leftover frying fats and soup fat.",
        "For cooking processes, such as sauteing (pan frying), or deep fat frying, it is best to use the vegetable and nut oils.",
        "These are more plentiful, and hence cheaper than the animal fats; the latter, however, can be produced in the home from the fats of meats and leftover pan fats, which should not be overlooked as frying mediums.",
        "Butter and butter substitutes are best kept for table use and for flavoring.",
        "The hydrogenated oils, home rendered fats, lard and beef and mutton suet can be used for shortening fats.",
        "In the purchase of meats, the careful housewife should see that the butcher gives her all the fat she pays for, as all fats can be rendered very easily at home and can be used for cooking purposes.",
        "Butchers usually leave as large a proportion of fat as possible on all cuts of meat which, when paid for at meat prices, are quite an expensive item.",
        "All good clear fat should, therefore, be carefully trimmed from meats before cooking.",
        "Few people either like or find digestible greasy, fat meats, and the fat paid for at meat prices, which could have been rendered and used for cooking, is wasted when sent to table.",
        "There are various methods of conserving fat.",
        "First, the economical use of table fats; second, the saving of cooking; and third, the proper use of all types of fat.",
        "Economy in the use of table fats may best be secured by careful serving.",
        "One serving of butter is a little thing there are about sixty four of them in a pound.",
        "In many households the butter left on the plates probably would equal a serving or one fourth of an ounce, daily, which is usually scraped into the garbage pail or washed off in the dishpan.",
        "But if everyone of our 20,000,000 households should waste one fourth of an ounce of butter daily, it would mean 312,500 pounds a day, or 114,062,500 pounds a year.",
        "To make this butter would take 265,261,560 gallons of milk, or the product of over a half million cows, an item in national economy which should not be overlooked.",
        "When butter is used to flavor cooked vegetables, it is more economical to add it just before they are served rather than while they are cooking.",
        "The flavor thus imparted is more pronounced, and, moreover, if the butter is added before cooking, much of it will be lost in the water unless the latter is served with the vegetables.",
        "Butter substitutes, such as oleomargarine and nut margarine, should be more largely used for the table, especially for adults.",
        "Conserve butter for children, as animal fats contain vitamines necessary for growing tissues.",
        "Butter substitutes are as digestible and as nourishing as butter, and have a higher melting point.",
        "They keep better and cost less.",
        "Oleomargarine, which has been in existence for fifty years, was first offered to the world in 1870 by a famous French chemist, Mege Mouries, who was in search of a butter substitute cheap enough to supply the masses with the much needed food element.",
        "He had noticed that the children of the poor families were afflicted with rickets and other diseases which could be remedied by the administration of the right amount of fat.",
        "He combined fresh suet and milk and called the product \"oleomargarine.\" In the United States this product is now made of oleo oil or soft beef fat, neutral lard, cottonseed and other oils, churned with a small quantity of milk, and in the finer grades, cream is sometimes used.",
        "A certain proportion of butter is usually added, and the whole worked up with salt as in ordinary butter making.",
        "Owing to the fears of the butter makers that oleomargarine would supplant their product in popular favor, legislation was enacted that restricted the manufacture of oleo and established a rigid system of governmental inspection, so that the product is now manufactured under the most sanitary conditions which furnishes a cleaner and more reliable product than natural butter.",
        "Nut margarine is a compound of cocoa oil, which so closely resembles butter that only an expert can distinguish it from the natural product.",
        "Both these butter substitutes are used in large amounts by the best bakers, confectioners and biscuit manufacturers, and foolish prejudice against butter substitutes should not deter their use in the home.",
        "A large saving in cooking fats can be made by the careful utilization of all fats that come into the home.",
        "Beef and mutton suet can be rendered and made available.",
        "Fats which have been saved after meals are cooked should be clarified that is, freed from all objectionable odors, tastes or color so as to be made available as shortening and frying fats.",
        "The following recipes and suggestions make possible the use of all fats, and as fat shortage is one of the most serious of the world's food problems, it is essential that every housekeeper have a larger knowledge of the utilization and economy of this essential food.",
        "[Illustration] TO RENDER FATS TO RENDER FAT BY DIRECT METHOD Run the fat through the household meat grinder or chop fine in the chopping bowl.",
        "Then heat in the double boiler until completely melted, finally straining through a rather thick cloth or two thicknesses of cheese cloth, wrung out in hot water.",
        "By this method there is no danger of scorching.",
        "Fats heated at a low temperature also keep better than those melted at higher temperature.",
        "After the fat is rendered, it should be slowly reheated to sterilize it and make sure it is free from moisture.",
        "The bits of tissue strained out, commonly known as cracklings, may be used for shortening purposes or may be added to cornmeal which is to be used as fried cornmeal mush.",
        "TO RENDER FAT WITH MILK To two pounds of fat (finely chopped if unrendered) add one half pint of milk, preferably sour.",
        "Heat the mixture in a double boiler until thoroughly melted.",
        "Stir well and strain through a thick cloth or two thicknesses of cheese cloth wrung out in hot water.",
        "When cold the fat forms a hard, clean layer and any material adhering to the under side of the fat, may be scraped off.",
        "Sour milk being coagulated is preferable to sweet milk since the curd remains on the cloth through which the rendered mixture is strained and is thus more easily separated from the rendered fat which has acquired some of the milk flavor and butter fat.",
        "TO RENDER FAT BY COLD WATER METHOD Cut fat in small pieces.",
        "Cover with cold water.",
        "Heat slowly.",

        "TO RENDER STRONG FLAVORED FATS To mutton, duck or goose fat add equal amount of beef suet or vegetable fat and render same as suet.",
        "This may then be used for shortening, or pan broiling for meat or fish dishes, and not have the characteristic taste of the stronger fats.",
        "When rendering strong mutton, duck or goose fats if a small whole onion is added the strong flavor of the fat is reduced.",
        "Remove the onion before straining.",
        "It may be used in cooking.",
        "TO CLARIFY FAT Melt the fat in an equal volume of water and heat for a short time at a moderate temperature.",
        "Stir occasionally.",
        "Cool and remove the layer of fat which forms on the top, scraping off any bits of meat or other material which may adhere to the other side.",
        "Fats which have formed on top of soups, of cooked meats (such as pot roast, stews), salt meats (such as corned beef, ham, etc.), or strong fats, such as from boiled mutton, poultry and game, may be clarified in this way and used alone or combined with other animal or vegetable fats in any savory dish.",
        "CARE OF FAT AFTER BEING USED FOR COOKING If fat is used for deep fat frying as croquettes, doughnuts, fritters, etc., while fat is still hot, add a few slices raw potato and allow it to stay in the fat until it is cool.",
        "Remove potato strain fat, allow to harden and it is ready to use.",
        "The potato absorbs odors from fat.",
        "HOW TO MAKE SAVORY FATS FAT 1: To 1 pound of unrendered fat (chopped fine) add 1 slice of onion about one half inch thick and two inches in diameter, 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoonful salt, and about one eighth teaspoonful of pepper.",
