Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. Irony is about humour and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within socialist feminism. At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg. A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world changing fiction. The international women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements have constructed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion. Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. 150 Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality. Cyborg \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sex\u00e2\u20ac\u009d restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against heterosexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization work, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C3I, command control communication intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US defence budget. I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruitful couplings. Michael Foucault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field. By the late twentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cyborg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centres structuring any possibility of historical transformation. In the traditions of \u00e2\u20ac\u009dWestern\u00e2\u20ac\u009d science and politics the tradition of racist, male dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tradition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This chapter is an argument for pleasure in the confusion of boundaries and for responsibility in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist feminist culture and theory in a postmodernist, non naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end. The cyborg incarnation is outside salvation history. Nor does it mark time on an oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, and nuclear culture, the most terrible and perhaps the most promising monsters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non oedipal narratives with a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival. The cyborg is a creature in a post gender world; it has no truck with bisexuality, pre oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153final\u00e2\u20ac\u009d irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic telos of the 151 \u00e2\u20ac\u009dWest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u009d escalating dominations of abstract individuation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story in the \u00e2\u20ac\u009dWestern,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phallic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most powerfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labour and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out of which difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as star wars. The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completely without innocence. No longer structured by the polarity of public and private, the cyborg defines a technological polls based partly on a revolution of social relations in the oikos, the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The relationships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; that is, through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyborgs are not reverent; they do not re member the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy for connection they seem to have a natural feel for united front politics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential. I will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this chapter, but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the following political fictional (political scientific) analysis possible. By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beachheads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks language tool 152 use, social behaviour, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles the separation of human and animal. And many people no longer feel the need for such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure of connection of human and other living creatures. Movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are a clear sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. Biology and evolutionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects of knowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social science. Within this framework, teaching modern Christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse. Biological determinist ideology is only one position opened up in scientific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room for radical political people to contest the meanings of the breached boundary. The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from signalling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal distrurbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange. The second leaky distinction is between animal human (organism) and machine. Pre cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was always the spectre of the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a dialectical progeny, called spirit or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self moving, self designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dream, only mock it. They were not man, an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream. To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late twentieth century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert. Technological determination is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Textualization\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of everything in poststructuralist, postmodernist theory has been damned by Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disregard for the lived relations of domination that ground the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153play\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of arbitrary reading. It is certainly true that postmodernist strategies, like my cyborg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (for example, the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature a 153 source of insight and promise of innocence is undermined, probably fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpretation is lost, and with it the ontology grounding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Western\u00e2\u20ac\u009d epistemology. But the alternative is not cynicism or faithlessness, that is, some version of abstract existence, like the accounts of technological determinism destroying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153machine\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful political action\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153text.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Both chimpanzees and artifacts have politics, so why shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we? The third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between physical and non physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a kind of popular scientific equivalent to Harlequin romances as a marker of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong, but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ubiquity and spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technology are old partners in Western stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our experience of mechanism. Miniaturization has turned out to be about power; small is not so much beautiful as pre eminently dangerous, as in cruise missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s with the TV wrist bands or hand sized video cameras now advertised. Our best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum, and these machines are eminently portable, mobile a matter of immense human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence. The ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these sunshine belt machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially. They are about consciousness or its simulation. They are floating signifiers moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch weavings of the displaced and so unnatural \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greenham women,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d who read the cyborg webs of power so very well, than by the militant labour of older masculinist politics, whose natural constituency needs defence jobs. Ultimately the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hardest\u00e2\u20ac\u009d science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, C3I, cryptography, and the preservation of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers are sun worshippers mediating a new scientific revolution 154 associated with the night dream of post industrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no more\u00e2\u20ac\u009d than the minuscule coding changes of an antigen in the immune system, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no more\u00e2\u20ac\u009d than the experience of stress. The nimble fingers of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oriental\u00e2\u20ac\u009d women, the old fascination of little Anglo Saxon Victorian girls with doll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s houses, women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enforced attention to the small take on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice [of Wonderland] taking account of these new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita jail whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies. So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formulations, and physical artefacts associated with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high technology\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and scientific culture. From One Dimensional Man (Marcuse, 1964) to The Death of Nature (Merchant, 1980), the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist world wide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies. From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star Wars apocalypse waged in the name of defence, about the final appropriation of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bodies in a masculinist orgy of war (Sofia, 1984). From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily realities in which people are not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many headed monsters. Cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance and recoupling. I like to imagine LAG, the Livermore Action Group, as a kind of cyborg society, dedicated to realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools 155 of technological apocalypse, and committed to building a political form that actually manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts, Christians, mothers, and Leninists long enough to disarm the state. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fission Impossible\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is the name of the affinity group in my town. (Affinity: related not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another, avidity.) The Informatics of Domination In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the extent and importance of rearrangements in world wide social relations tied to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system of world order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system from all work to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I have called the informatics of domination: Representation / Simulation. Bourgeois novel, realism / Science fiction, postmodernism. Organism / Biotic Component. Depth, integrity / Surface, boundary. Heat / Noise. Biology as clinical practice / Biology as inscription. Physiology / Communications engineering. Small group / Subsystem. Perfection / Optimization. Eugenics / Population Control. Decadence, Magic Mountain / Obsolescence, Future Shock. Hygiene / Stress Management. Microbiology, tuberculosis / Immunology, AIDS. Organic division of labour / Ergonomics/cybernetics of labour. Functional specialization / Modular construction. Reproduction / Replication. Organic sex role specialization / Optimal genetic strategies. Biological determinism / Evolutionary inertia, constraints. Community ecology / Ecosystem. Racial chain of being / Neo imperialism, United Nations humanism. Scientific management in home factory / Global factory/Electronic cottage. Family Market Factory / Women in the Integrated Circuit. Family wage / Comparable worth. Public/Private / Cyborg citizenship. Nature/Culture / Fields of difference. Co operation / Communications enhancement. Freud / Lacan. Sex / Genetic engineering. Labour / Robotics. Mind / Artificial Intelligence. Second World War / Star Wars. White Capitalist Patriarchy / Informatics of Domination. 162 This list suggests several interesting things. First, the objects on the right hand side cannot be coded as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a realization that subverts naturalistic coding for the left hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically or materially. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153god\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is dead; so is the \u00e2\u20ac\u009dgoddess.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Or both are revivified in the worlds charged with microelectronic and biotechnological politics. In relation to objects like biotic components, one must not think in terms of essential properties, but in terms of design, boundary constraints, rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits as a function of the system environment. Ideologies of sexual reproduction can no longer reasonably call on notions of sex and sex role as organic aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will be unmasked as irrational, and ironically corporate executives reading Playboy and anti porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly unmasking the irrationalism. Likewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be formulated in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence scores. It is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrational\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized. For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives way to a new practice called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experimental ethnography\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in which an organic object dissipates in attention to the play of writing. At the level of ideology, we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development and under development, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly; no \u00e2\u20ac\u009dnatural\u00e2\u20ac\u009d architectures constrain system design. The financial districts in all the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cities, as well as the export processing and free trade zones, proclaim this elementary fact of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153late capitalism.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The entire universe of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems in 163 communications engineering (for the managers) or theories of the text (for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies. One should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary conditions and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries and not on the integrity of natural objects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Integrity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sincerity\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the Western self gives way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies applied to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capacities to give birth to new human beings will be developed in the languages of population control and maximization of goal achievement for individual decision makers. Control strategies will be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings, like any other component or subsystem, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analysed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this universe is stress communications breakdown. The cyborg is not subject to Foucault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field of operations. This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge which have appeared historically since the Second World War prepares us to notice some important inadequacies in feminist analysis which has proceeded as if the organic, hierarchical dualisms ordering discourse in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the West\u00e2\u20ac\u009d since Aristotle still ruled. They have been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia (Sofoulis) might put it, they have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153techno digested.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The dichotomies between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and culture, men and women, primitive and civilized are all in question ideologically. The actual situation of women is their integration/ exploitation into a world system of production/reproduction and communication called the informatics of domination. The home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself all can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others consequences that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist feminist politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code. 164 Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women world wide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, of the fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings. The boundary is permeable between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually constitute each other. Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed by a common move the translation of the world into a problem of coding, a search for a common language in which all resistance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange. In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic (feedback controlled) systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer design, weapons deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key questions rests on a theory of language and control; the key operation is determining the rates, directions, and probabilities of flow of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries differentially permeable to information. Information is just that kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation, and so unhindered instrumental power (called effective communication). The biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system breakdown is a function of stress. The fundamentals of this technology can be condensed into the metaphor C31, command control communication intelligence, the military\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s symbol for its operations theory. In modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, sociobiological evolutionary theory, and immunobiology. The organism has been translated into problems of genetic coding and read out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs research broadly. In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects of knowledge, giving way to biotic components, i.e., special kinds of information processing devices. The analogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated medical practices are rich exemplars of the privilege of coding and recognition systems as objects of knowledge, as constructions of bodily reality for us. Biology here is a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind of intelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the difference between self and other. Human babies with 165 baboon hearts evoke national ethical perplexity for animal rights activists at least as much as for the guardians of human purity. In the US gay men and intravenous drug users are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153privileged\u00e2\u20ac\u009d victims of an awful immune system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of boundaries and moral pollution (Treichler, 1987). But these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate fundamental transformations in the structure of the world for us. Communications technologies depend on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power, welfare state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication of our imaginations, labour control systems, medical constructions of our bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labour, and religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Microelectronics is the technical basis of simulacra; that is, of copies without originals. Microelectronics mediates the translations of labour into robotics and word processing, sex into genetic engineering and reproductive technologies, and mind into artificial intelligence and decision procedures. The new biotechnologies concern more than human reproduction. Biology as a powerful engineering science for redesigning materials and processes has revolutionary implications for industry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentation, agriculture, and energy. Communications sciences and biology are constructions of natural technical objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism is thoroughly blurred; mind, body, and tool are on very intimate terms. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multinational\u00e2\u20ac\u009d material organization of the production and reproduction of daily life and the symbolic organization of the production and reproduction of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary maintaining images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal never seemed more feeble. I have used Rachel Grossman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (1980) image of women in the integrated circuit to name the situation of women in a world so intimately restructured through the social relations of science and technology. I used the odd circumlocution, \u00e2\u20ac\u009dthe social relations of science and technology,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to indicate that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources of power, that we need fresh sources of analysis and political action (Latour, 1984). Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high tech facilitated social relations can make socialist feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics. 166 Women in the Integrated Circuit Let me summarize the picture of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical locations in advanced industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible ideologically to characterize women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives by the distinction of public and private domains suggested by images of the division of working class life into factory and home, of bourgeois life into market and home, and of gender existence into personal and political realms it is now a totally misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image, suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Networking\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy weaving is for oppositional cyborgs. So let me return to the earlier image of the informatics of domination and trace one vision of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153place\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in the integrated circuit, touching only a few idealized social locations seen primarily from the point of view of advanced capitalist societies: Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State, School, Clinic Hospital, and Church. Each of these idealized spaces is logically and practically implied in every other locus, perhaps analogous to a holographic photograph. I want to suggest the impact of the social relations mediated and enforced by the new technologies in order to help formulate needed analysis and practical work. However, there is no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153place\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for women in these networks, only geometries of difference and contradiction crucial to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cyborg identities. If we learn how to read these webs of power and social life, we might learn new couplings, new coalitions. There is no way to read the following list from a standpoint of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153identification,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of a unitary self. The issue is dispersion. The task is to survive in the diaspora. Home: Women headed households, serial monogamy, flight of men, old women alone, technology of domestic work, paid homework, re emergence of home sweat shops, home based businesses and telecommuting, electronic cottage, urban homelessness, migration, module architecture, reinforced (simulated) nuclear family, intense domestic violence. Market: Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuing consumption work, newly targeted to buy the profusion of new production from the new technologies (especially as the competitive race among industrialized and industrializing nations to avoid dangerous mass unemployment necessitates finding ever bigger new markets for ever less clearly needed commodities); bimodal buying power, coupled with advertising targeting of the numerous affluent groups and neglect of the previous mass markets; growing importance of 171 informal markets in labour and commodities parallel to high tech, affluent market structures; surveillance systems through electronic funds transfer; intensified market abstraction (commodification) of experience, resulting in ineffective utopian or equivalent cynical theories of community; extreme mobility (abstraction) of marketing/financing systems; inter penetration of sexual and labour markets; intensified sexualization of abstracted and alienated consumption. Paid Work Place: Continued intense sexual and racial division of labour, but considerable growth of membership in privileged occupational categories for many white women and people of colour; impact of new technologies on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work in clerical, service, manufacturing (especially textiles), agriculture, electronics; international restructuring of the working classes; development of new time arrangements to facilitate the homework economy (flex time, part time, over time, no time); homework and out work; increased pressures for two tiered wage structures; significant numbers of people in cash dependent populations world wide with no experience or no further hope of stable employment; most labour \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marginal\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feminized.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d State: Continued erosion of the welfare state; decentralizations with increased surveillance and control; citizenship by telematics; imperialism and political power broadly in the form of information rich/information poor differentiation; increased high tech militarization increasingly opposed by many social groups; reduction of civil service jobs as a result of the growing capital intensification of office work, with implications for occupational mobility for women of colour; growing privatization of material and ideological life and culture; close integration of privatization and militarization, the high tech forms of bourgeois capitalist personal and public life; invisibility of different social groups to each other, linked to psychological mechanisms of belief in abstract enemies. School: Deepening coupling of high tech capital needs and public education at all levels, differentiated by race, class, and gender; managerial classes involved in educational reform and refunding at the cost of remaining progressive educational democratic structures for children and teachers; education for mass ignorance and repression in technocratic and militarized culture; growing science mystery cults in dissenting and radical political movements; continued relative scientific illiteracy among white women and people of colour; growing industrial direction of education (especially higher education) by science based multinationals (particularly in electronics and biotechnology dependent companies); highly educated, numerous elites in a progressively bimodal society. Clinic hospital: Intensified machine body relations; renegotiations of 172 public metaphors which channel personal experience of the body, particularly in relation to reproduction, immune system functions, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stress phenomena\u00e2\u20ac\u009d; intensification of reproductive politics in response to world historical implications of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unrealized, potential control of their relation to reproduction; emergence of new, historically specific diseases; struggles over meanings and means of health in environments pervaded by high technology products and processes; continuing feminization of health work; intensified struggle over state responsibility for health; continued ideological role of popular health movements as a major form of American politics. Church: Electronic fundamentalist \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super saver\u00e2\u20ac\u009d preachers solemnizing the union of electronic capital and automated fetish gods; intensified importance of churches in resisting the militarized state; central struggle over women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meanings and authority in religion; continued relevance of spirituality, intertwined with sex and health, in political struggle. The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency of a socialist feminist politics addressed to science and technology is plain. There is much now being done, and the grounds for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collective struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s District 925, should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are profoundly deaf to technical restructuring of labour processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labour organization, involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the largely white male industrial unions. The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of science and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be ultimately depressed by the implications of late twentieth century women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relation to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowledge, sexuality, and reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps especially from women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s points of view, is often virulent forms of oppression, nostalgically naturalized in the face of current violation. Ambivalence towards the disrupted unities mediated by high tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories of clear sighted critique \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grounding a solid political epistemology\u00e2\u20ac\u009d 173 versus \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manipulated false consciousness,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d but subtle understanding of emerging pleasures, experiences, and powers with serious potential for changing the rules of the game. There are grounds for hope in the emerging bases for new kinds of unity across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units of socialist feminist analysis themselves suffer protean transformations. Intensifications of hardship experienced world wide in connection with the social relations of science and technology are severe. But what people are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack authentically subtle connections for collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological to clarify even \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our\u00e2\u20ac\u009d experience are rudimentary. I am conscious of the odd perspective provided by my historical position a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact on US national science education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post Second World War arms race and cold war as by the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements. There are more grounds for hope in focusing on the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American technocrats, which also produced large numbers of dissidents, than in focusing on the present defeats. The permanent partiality of feminist points of view has consequences for our expectations of forms of political organization and participation. We do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense, dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps, ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations of science and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science. Cyborgs: A Myth of Political Identity I want to conclude with a myth about identity and boundaries which might inform late twentieth century political imaginations (Plate 1). I am indebted in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree, Jr, Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda McIntyre. These are our story tellers exploring what it means to be embodied in high tech worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring conceptions of bodily boundaries and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas (1966, 1970) should be credited with helping us to consciousness about how fundamental body imagery is to world view, and so to political language. French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their differences, know how to write the body; how to weave eroticism, cosmology, and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies. American radical feminists like Susan Griffnn, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language. They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological. But their symbolic systems and the related positions of ecofeminism and feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late capitalism. In that sense they are part of the cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilities inherent in the breakdown of clean distinctions between organism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric possibilities. What might be learned from personal and political \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technological\u00e2\u20ac\u009d pollution? I look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: constructions of women of colour and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction. Earlier I suggested that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153women of colour\u00e2\u20ac\u009d might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political historical layerings of her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biomythography,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Zami (Lorde, 1982; King, 1987a, 1987b). There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential, Audre Lorde (1984) captures the tone in the title of her Sister Outsider. In my political myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom US workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy preventing their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division, competition, and exploitation in the same industries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women of colour\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are the preferred labour force for the science based industries, the real women for whom the world wide sexual market, labour market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex industry and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheap\u00e2\u20ac\u009d female labour so attractive to the multinationals. Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oral primitive,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d literacy is a special mark of women of colour, acquired by US black women as well as 175 men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and writing. Writing has a special significance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western myth of the distinction between oral and written cultures, primitive and civilized mentalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153postmodernist\u00e2\u20ac\u009d theories attacking the phallo centrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular work, the unique and perfect name. Contests for the meanings of writing are a major form of contemporary political struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The poetry and stories of US women of colour are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once upon a time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other. The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and displace the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling origin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths of origin of Western culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfillment in apocalypse. The phallocentric origin stories most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies technologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics that have recently textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C3I. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control. Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of colour; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by US women of colour. For example, retellings of the story of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mestizo \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bastard\u00e2\u20ac\u009d race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga (1983) in Loving in the War Years explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate heterosexuality in the garden of culture, and so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Moraga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mastery of the conqueror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language a violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s language is not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole\u00e2\u20ac\u009d; it is self consciously spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s languages. But it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before 176 violation, that crafts the erode, competent, potent identities of women of colour. Sister Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral of appropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body, affirms it as the body of a woman of colour, against the possibility of passing into the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153original illiteracy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman before the Fall into Writing needed by the phallocentric Family of Man. Writing is pre eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallocentrism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollution, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings which make Man and Woman so problematic, subverting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduction of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Western\u00e2\u20ac\u009d identity, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u009d did not originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagines the reproduction of individuals before the wider replications of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153texts.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground politics in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our\u00e2\u20ac\u009d privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position of moral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream of a common language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile \u00e2\u20ac\u0153masculine\u00e2\u20ac\u009d separation, but written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oneself\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in identification, vanguard parties, purity, and mothering. Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins and the importance of a mother like Malinche. Women of colour have transformed her from the evil mother of 177 masculinist fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival. This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation. Every story that begins with original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separation, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation; that is, war, tempered by imaginary respite in the bosom of the Other. These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics rebirth without flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selflhood, weaker individuation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It passes through women and other present tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cyborgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many times a \u00e2\u20ac\u009dwestern\u00e2\u20ac\u009d commentator remarks on the sad passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Western\u00e2\u20ac\u009d technology, by writing. These real life cyborgs (for example, the Southeast Asian village women workers in Japanese and US electronics firms described by Aihwa Ong) are actively rewriting the texts of their bodies and societies. Survival is the stakes in this play of readings. To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western traditions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers, animals in short, domination of all constituted as others, whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/ made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other, the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of domination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many. High tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that resolve into coding practices. In so far as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (for example, biology) and in daily practice (for example, the homework economy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, communications 178 devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontological separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic. The replicant Rachael in the Ridley Scott film Blade Runner stands as the image of a cyborg culture\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fear, love, and confusion. One consequence is that our sense of connection to our tools is heightened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization with other communication devices. Anne McCaffrey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre feminist The Ship Who Sang (1969) explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexuality, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsulated by skin? From the seventeenth century until now, machines could be animated given ghostly souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental capacities. Or organisms could be mechanized reduced to body understood as resource of mind. These machine/ organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices, intimate components, friendly selves. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need organic holism to give impermeable wholeness, the total woman and her feminist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction. The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problematic the statuses of man or woman, human, artifact, member of a race, individual entity, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in reading these fictions is not largely based on identification. Students facing Joanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. The Female Man is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science fiction of Samuel R. Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to subvert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction was regarded as particularly manly until her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\u009d gender was revealed, tells tales of reproduction based on non mammalian technologies like alternation of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing. John Varley 179 constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch feminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess planet trickster old woman technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of post cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler writes of an African sorceress pitting her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of time warps that bring a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white master ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred), and of the illegitimate insights into identity and community of an adopted cross species child who came to know the enemy as self (Survivor). In Dawn (1987), the first installment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of Nigerian immigrants to the US. A black woman and a mother whose child is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic exchange with extra terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers, who reform earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving humans into intimate fusion with them. It is a novel that interrogates reproductive, linguistic, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth century race and gender. Because it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIntyre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply\u00e2\u20ac\u009d human, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Laenea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives a virus caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species. All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and intimacy even in this world of protean transformation and connection. Superluminal stands also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense; it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to in this chapter. This is a conjunction with a long history that many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First World\u00e2\u20ac\u009d feminists have tried to repress, including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account by Zoe Sofoulis, 180 whose different location in the world system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s informatics of domination made her acutely alert to the imperialist moment of all science fiction cultures, including women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s science fiction. From an Australian feminist sensitivity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as writer of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Star Trek series than her rewriting the romance in Superluminal. Monsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations. The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centered polls of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and legal, portents and diseases all crucial to establishing modern identity. The evolutionary and behavioral sciences of monkeys and apes have marked the multiple boundaries of late twentieth century industrial identities. Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman. There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power and identity. Cyborgs are no exception. A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they. Up until now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric extensions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth. The ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity, as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life. 181 But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the informatics of domination in order to act potently. One last image: organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender. Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the supersavers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess. ",

        "Donna Haraway, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cyborg Manifesto\u00e2\u20ac\u009d This chapter is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism.",
        "Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification.",
        "Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously.",
        "I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist feminism.",
        "Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still insisting on the need for community.",
        "Blasphemy is not apostasy.",
        "Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialectically, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true.",
        "Irony is about humour and serious play.",
        "It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honoured within socialist feminism.",
        "At the centre of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg.",
        "A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction.",
        "Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world changing fiction.",
        "The international women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movements have constructed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object.",
        "This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind.",
        "Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility.",
        "The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience in the late twentieth century.",

        "Students facing Joanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take modernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of The Adventures of Alyx or The Female Man, where characters refuse the reader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics.",
        "The Female Man is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken together do not make a whole, resolve the dilemmas of violent moral action, or remove the growing scandal of gender.",
        "The feminist science fiction of Samuel R.",
        "Delany, especially Tales of Neveyon, mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to subvert their plausibility.",
        "James Tiptree, Jr, an author whose fiction was regarded as particularly manly until her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\u009d gender was revealed, tells tales of reproduction based on non mammalian technologies like alternation of generations of male brood pouches and male nurturing.",
        "John Varley 179 constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch feminist exploration of Gaea, a mad goddess planet trickster old woman technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of post cyborg symbioses are spawned.",
        "Octavia Butler writes of an African sorceress pitting her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival (Wild Seed), of time warps that bring a modern US black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white master ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth (Kindred), and of the illegitimate insights into identity and community of an adopted cross species child who came to know the enemy as self (Survivor).",
        "In Dawn (1987), the first installment of a series called Xenogenesis, Butler tells the story of Lilith Iyapo, whose personal name recalls Adam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first and repudiated wife and whose family name marks her status as the widow of the son of Nigerian immigrants to the US.",
        "A black woman and a mother whose child is dead, Lilith mediates the transformation of humanity through genetic exchange with extra terrestrial lovers/rescuers/destroyers/genetic engineers, who reform earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s habitats after the nuclear holocaust and coerce surviving humans into intimate fusion with them.",
        "It is a novel that interrogates reproductive, linguistic, and nuclear politics in a mythic field structured by late twentieth century race and gender.",
        "Because it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda McIntyre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Superluminal can close this truncated catalogue of promising and dangerous monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing.",
        "In a fiction where no character is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply\u00e2\u20ac\u009d human, human status is highly problematic.",
        "Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans.",
        "Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means.",
        "Laenea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light.",
        "Radu Dracul survives a virus caused plague in his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species.",
        "All the characters explore the limits of language; the dream of communicating experience; and the necessity of limitation, partiality, and intimacy even in this world of protean transformation and connection.",
        "Superluminal stands also for the defining contradictions of a cyborg world in another sense; it embodies textually the intersection of feminist theory and colonial discourse in the science fiction I have alluded to in this chapter.",
        "This is a conjunction with a long history that many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First World\u00e2\u20ac\u009d feminists have tried to repress, including myself in my readings of Superluminal before being called to account by Zoe Sofoulis, 180 whose different location in the world system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s informatics of domination made her acutely alert to the imperialist moment of all science fiction cultures, including women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s science fiction.",
        "From an Australian feminist sensitivity, Sofoulis remembered more readily McIntyre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as writer of the adventures of Captain Kirk and Spock in TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Star Trek series than her rewriting the romance in Superluminal.",
        "Monsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imaginations.",
        "The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centered polls of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman.",
        "Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused human material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and supernatural, medical and legal, portents and diseases all crucial to establishing modern identity.",
        "The evolutionary and behavioral sciences of monkeys and apes have marked the multiple boundaries of late twentieth century industrial identities.",
        "Cyborg monsters in feminist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman.",
        "There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies.",
        "Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are maps of power and identity.",
        "Cyborgs are no exception.",
        "A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted.",
        "One is too few, and two is only one possibility.",
        "Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment.",
        "The machine is not an it to be animated, worshipped, and dominated.",
        "The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment.",
        "We can be responsible for machines; they do not dominate or threaten us.",
        "We are responsible for boundaries; we are they.",
        "Up until now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric extensions.",
        "Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females.",
        "Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment.",
        "Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.",
        "The ideologically charged question of what counts as daily activity, as experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image.",
        "Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological position potentially.",
        "There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life.",
        "181 But the ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility taking a global vengeance.",
        "Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts.",
        "There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction.",
        "There is a myth system waiting to become a political language to ground one way of looking at science and technology and challenging the informatics of domination in order to act potently.",
        "One last image: organisms and organismic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex.",
        "I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing.",
        "For salamanders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant possibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site of former injury.",
        "The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, potent.",
        "We have all been injured, profoundly.",
        "We require regeneration, not rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.",
        "Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts.",
        "It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations.",
        "Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves.",
        "This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia.",
        "It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the supersavers of the new right.",
        "It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories.",
        "Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess."
