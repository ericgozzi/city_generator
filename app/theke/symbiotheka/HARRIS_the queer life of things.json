And yet, we do. Might we be at a globally similar juncture now? Not an emotional breaking point perhaps, but a material one. It is not possible to drain all the oil and gas out of the earth\u2019s veins and have it continue to function like a healthy body. It is not possible to starve and torture three quarters of the world\u2019s population and have the human tribe body function as though it is healthy. Perhaps we are already here. Perhaps it was meant to be. Perhaps, as playwright Samuel Beckett told us, it\u2019s done already, perhaps they have said me already, perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story, that would surprise me, if it opens, it will be I, it will be the silence, where I am, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll never know, in the silence you don\u2019t know, you must go on, I can\u2019t go on, I\u2019ll go on. (Beckett 1954/1991, p. 414) Perhaps, as has been said of Beckett\u2019s work, that humanity is elevated in tragi comic humiliation and degradation. Perhaps posthumanism and new materialism are only playing at shifting our attention from our anthropocentric obsessions just long enough to make us love ourselves as and always in relation to others once more. Or to begin doing so. How very human; how very queer. The Queer Life of Things: Performance, Affect, and the More Than Human offers essays united by their affective and material loyalties to the endlessly fascinating world of the more than human objects and things that fill our lives and with which we travel. They find and follow new materialist, posthumanist, affect and feminist theoretics, breadcrumb trails through the rapidly proliferating range of cartographies of life making in twenty first century earth. They acknowledge the acceleration of anthropogenic symptoms which affect us as human, nonhuman, and emergent lifeforms, seek more ethical ways of sustaining ourselves while also sustaining the planet and our cohabitants, and reflect our ardent hope that better ways are possible and just around the comer. The Queer Life of Things investigates a range of intra actions!qncounters/ events between human and more than human actors, sometimes in research contexts and sometimes in everyday contexts. In order to do so, we look not only at what is \u201clive\u201d or \u201canimate,\u201d but also what is a body relation with other flesh and fur and stone bodies. Big change starts with small steps, and we believe this text is an embodiment and enactment of the temporal and material changes that we all so deeply long for and spiritually now urgently require. For this we rely not only on theoretical explorations and build upon philosophical forebears, but upon our artist ancestors who offer us \u201cfuture fables for now\u201d (Go Behind the Scenes with Patricia Piccinini 2018), the kind of fantasmagorical transgenics that can soften us toward our increasingly hybrid lives and ease the material and virtual terror in which we currently live. We understand the need for more peaceful coexistence with the things of our lives in equal measure to the humans and other animals in our lives. Indeed, in our consistent failure to reduce, rather than increase, the conflict between humans on this planet we turn in hope to our nonhuman companions, devices, objects and things, with some renewed humility and gratitude, recognizing that overtly or not, they teach us lessons about empathy and care that we repeatedly fail to learn fron^etween other humans. In this, we recognize what our mothers used to call the \u201csacredness of human life\u201d as being absolutely sacrosanct for all other beings, animate and non animate. We offer this book as a meditation on the sacredness of all life, whether we recognize it as life or not. The current wave of new materialist and posthumanist literature (this book included) has tackled the concerns of animal (Haraway 2008, 2006; Chaud huri & Hughes 2014), environmental (Braidotti 2014, 2013; Chen 2012) and sometimes microbial beings (Barad 2015; Bennett 2010), but not as often does it venture into the explicit realm of plant life. Michael Marder\u2019s 2013 book Plant thinking takes on vegetal beings directly, and together Luce Iriga ray and Marder (2016) extend this foundational work by collectively asking \u201cBut what about plants? Do they, too, have or constitute a world?\u201d (p. 112). Already more than human theoretics are developing their own hierarchies of value, of intelligibility, of a \u201cgrievable life\u201d (Butler 2004). In this text, we seek to queer the emergent hierarchies of posthumanism and new materialism, bringing feminist, queer and performance studies theory to the coalescing conversation of what constitutes a valuable area of nonhuman study. For example, Rosi Braidotti has made the point in several talks in recent years that posthumanism now requires a critical approach, differentiating between the \u201chuman augmentation\u201d of most artificial intelligence research and the more sustainability committed ecological approach of critical posthumanist studies she is driving at Utrecht. If machines and technological enhancement become increasingly the focus of posthumanist study, or indeed even the fear of epidemics, pandemics, and contagion as a primary driver of scientific enquiry rather than how to establish and maintain more planetary sustainable practices in the face of technological acceleration, what might be lost in the opportunity of a new materialist approach to other life forms beyond the human? Part of the project of this book is to ask \u201cwhat is the larger purpose and value\u2014the \u2018so what\u2019\u2014of posthuman and new materialist research and philosophical enquiry\u201d? One possible response to this question is to ask another question that lies at the heart of this book: What is gained by working to queer these emergent ideas and ways of engaging enquiry, even as they are forming? There is value, we try to suggest here, in working to remain open, unforeclosed, and unencumbered by the scholarly imperative to \u201cexplain\u201d things: for us, these theoretics go beyond explaining the world newly, indeed they redirect us away from a functional or use value analysis of human and other animals, plants, and objects, whether extrinsic or intrinsic. Indeed, a simple or relativist take on new materialist and posthumanist thought can bend powerful concepts like intra action into a reductive recipe for seeing everything as emergent and in the now, and miss the interdependency so crucial to thinking with. In other words, viewing new materialism and posthumanism as a means of shifting the reasoning away from purpose focus is not enough; we are trying to twist and redeploy\u2014to queer\u2014the practice of these theoretics in the hope that they can move us even further away from the Cartesian dualism that \u201cgot us here in the first place.\u201d Queer theory has always performed this anti teleological work\u2014it is a playful and nimble means of opening up philosophical and scholarly and disciplinary work that wants to seek surety, stability, and closure in the name of what might else be discovered, found, and possible. This breaking open and going beyond reason is a central element of this text\u2019s mission. Part of the projects of both posthumanism and new materialism is to prob lematize the notion of liveness, as well as what constitutes \u201ca life.\u201d Is only an \u201cinanimate\u201d thing an \u201cobject\u201d? At what point does a human or animal body become inanimate, and does that then relegate it to being an object? If humans are said to \u201cobjectify\u201d women or others by making them other, then why isn\u2019t a dog an object, if dogs are other? At what point to dogs become objects? And if we are truly moving into the Anthropocene, with its attendant shifts toward the agency of the more than human, perhaps change is needed in framing the practice of objectifying something as an insult; that \u201cdehumanising\u201d might not be such a bad thing after all. This book wonders about the edges of life and agency: do tears, for example, have their own material life separate from the body which emits them? More, this book understands life itself, in all its forms, as queer. And it is undeniably queer (or at least queerable in its moral and ethical relativism) that life exists differently in this anthropogenic moment than it has or will in other ages, and at different temporal and geographical intersections. When dogs, for example, perform well, they are still often humanized. The impulse toward anthropomorphising animals seems timeless. A recent Mexico City earthquake disaster saw dogs as heroes in which they were framed in some ways as super humans, both as rescuers and also as victims. Reports had it that one dog had saved twenty seven humans from the rubble (Jenkins 2017). And yet a white western notion of lives that have value retain hierarchies of value in which humans still have primacy. Then there is the rapidly growing area of work into the lives of data, including for example the work of Sarah Pink on broken data (2016; 2018). She and others are extending the way we think about data as alive, and as such is involved, like other living things, in ongoing cycles of \u201cdecay, making, repair, re making and growth, which are inextricable from the ongoing forms of creativity that stem from everyday contingencies and improvisatory human activity\u201d (2018). Such inquiry is a kind of \u201cqueer life of things\u201d for digital realms, but as we know digital lives and logics are impacting greater aspects of the everyday lives of non digital beings. QUEERING LIFE ITSELF What would it mean to live a queer life? What does it mean for any being animate or inanimate to live a queer life? A life that is curious? That is strange and different, a kaleidoscope for re configuring the busi ness as usual of everyday life? What is a queer dog? A queer cup? A queer river or tree? These questions are not new, nor is queering humanism and materialism a new project: Mel Y. Chen leads us to think broadly about decentring the human in queer theory, exploring what it means to treat the human as nothing more than one element in a queer critical assemblage.1 For Chen, queer, in the United States at least, \u201chas followed the two contradictory paths of re animation (beautiful collectivity/assemblage/reengagement of self with animate force) and de animation, which might help to explain the widespread fatigue with queer identity politics and internal racisms\u201d (2012, p. 58). The queer fatigue that Chen confronts is certainly global, and hinges on not only the racialized maneuvers that have left not only some scholars of colour but also female identified queers feeling unhappy with the term (and its failure to deliver on either its anti teleological disruptive promises, but also on its community ones as well). Yet the work Chen does toward queering queer is at the heart of how this text seeks to deploy queer: to queer things and new materialist and posthuman theory more generally; that is, we are interested in queering the onto epistemology of things in relation to humans and other animals, bodies, time, and space. The Vitality of (Nonhuman) Bodies At the same time as posthumanism and new materialism invites us to see the nonhuman world more agentically, disruptively, and therefore more queerly, changes in queerly identifying public practices and global flows have led to changes in queer (and more mainstream) cultures that are sometimes framed as a democratisation of queer relations, familial constellations, and the so called mainstreaming of LGBTIQ rights. Such hopeful human perspectives, like their nonhuman counterparts, have been challenged by research highlighting persistent disparities in human inequalities such as gender, sexuality, and race (Rayside 2008; Cruz Malave, A., & Manalansan), conservative backlashes against the global progression of sexual and reproductive rights (Park 2013; Weston 2005), and enduring tensions within increasingly homogenized LGBTQ, feminist, and postfeminist political ecologies and assemblages (Mezey 2015; Ringrose 2012; Yip 2004). And such shifts in the \u201clogic\u201d of queer politics and scholarship suggests new directions for interventions in sociocultural considerations and practices (Chen 2012), including object relationality and performativity. While we look elsewhere for signs of life, agency, and matter that matters, affect studies (Stewart 2007; Ahmed 2014; Siegworth & Gregg 2010) encourages scholars to look more critically at the emotions, intensities, flows and opportunistic natures of events and bodies. In this book, we take affect as a starting place, though not as a lens for putting ourselves in the place of objects, things, animals, and other non human subjects. Rather, we critically consider the affect of things in themselves. In so doing, we extend foundational concepts like Judith Halberstam\u2019s notion of \u201ctechnotopia\u201d (2005, p. 124), by which she refers to the power of trans* bodies to \u201cresist idealizations of bodily integrity, on the one hand, and rationalizations of its disintegration, on the other\u201d (p. 124). Like other new materialists, we queer the animat able possibilities of objects as things at all, building a logic of identity formation \u201cthrough decay, detachability, and subjectivity... of semi living objects, semi dying art pieces, and semi coherent human bodies.\u201d (Halberstam 2005, p. 124). Following Chen\u2019s queer ecological formations, we re combine this queering of the \u201cnon logical self\u201d (Halberstam 2005) and subjectivity itself with Jane Bennett (2010) and Stacy Alaimo and Susan Hekman\u2019s (2008) demand for a reconsideration of vitalism, or what Bennett calls a contemporary \u201cvital materialism\u201d2 (p. 63). For us, Butler\u2019s early deconstruction of gender from the material/biological into the performative helps us move new materialism beyond an anthropomorphic consideration of matter (whether physical or philosophical), and extends in/to the queemess of the relationship between matter and event itself. Bennett centralizes the political dimensions of a thorough posthumanist ethic as Donna Haraway previously suggested, and more recently Braidotti and Chen have done: How would political responses to public problems change were we to take seriously the vitality of (nonhuman) bodies? By \u201cvitality\u201d I mean the capacity of things\u2014edibles, commodities, storms, metals\u2014not only to impede or block the will and designs of humans but also to act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories, propensities, or tendencies of their own. (Bennett 2010, p. viii) The political dimension is perhaps more problematic than the philosophical one, although they are concomitant projects. Like contemporary environmen tal/human social movements like the \u201cNo DAPL\u201d [Dakota Access Pipeline protest best known by the hashtag #NoDAPL] protest movement in the United States (Holman Jones & Harris 2018), social and political movements can at times have enormous \u201cpeople power\u201d and yet fail to make lasting political impact.3 Inherent in Bennett\u2019s query is a centralization of the human experience, and human impact on the wider \u201cworld\u201d; what she calls articulating a \u201cvibrant materiality that runs alongside and inside humans\u201d (p. viii). A queering of things (or posthumanist and new materialist considerations of them) takes up the question of how \u201cthe world\u201d might be different, regardless of how the humanist project and human activity continues or ends. We accept as delightfully queer some of the ways in which the world/s around us is/are vitally advancing, despite of or indeed in light of our inattention. Animate, If Not Alive The \u201cliveness\u201d debate has proliferated since perhaps performance studies scholars Philip Auslander (1999) and Peggy Phelan (1993) diverged on the idea that performance hinges on presence\u2014it cannot be recorded or it becomes something else. Auslander\u2019s challenge was that in mediatized society the definition of liveness must necessarily expand. Phelan\u2019s insistence that her definition is ontological (that is, central to the essential nature of performance) meant that digital performance is \u201csomething other\u201d than live due to its reproducibility. Phelan\u2019s definition is grounded in Aristotelian unities of time, place and action. Not surprisingly, it bears similarities to some of today\u2019s core new materialist concepts including intra action, embodiment, becoming, and actants. Understandably this grows out of the attention to the body, matter, time and event in both performance studies and new materialism. But the emergence of new materialism in an age of digital media, an interdisciplinary field of study that does not always recognize its epistemological foundations in performance studies but instead looks more immediately to new formations of liveness in digital media cultures, affect theory, in some cases, brings performance to the conversation in interesting and vibrant ways. In 2010, new materialism became firmly ensconced in the academy through the first annual conference on new materialisms and digital culture at Anglia Ruskin University, UK, convened by Finnish (music performance) scholar Milla Tiainen and (digital media) scholar Jussi Parikka, called New Materialisms and Digital Culture. This conference brought together presenters interested not in defining \u201ca stable referent for that term so much as to point towards some of the problems it arguably connects with\u201d (Parikka, n.p ). In his opening remarks, Parikka flagged three upcoming books which have since become core texts for new materialist enquiry: Diana Cool and Samantha Frost\u2019s (2010) New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics', Estelle Barett and Barbara Bolt\u2019s (2012) Carnal Knowledge: Towards a New Materialism through the Arts and Rick Dolphjin and Iris van der Tuin\u2019s (2012) New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies. The conference and these publications marked the emergence and coalescence of new materialism as a field of study, and gestured toward some of its interdisciplinary preoccupations: embodiment through arts practice, the intersection of science and politics, and liveness, matter, and animacy. Scholars from proliferating disciplines have taken up this new focus on liveness, including feminism and new materialism (Alaimo & Hekman 2008); science and new materialism (Barad 2003; Bennett 2010), philosophy and new materialism/posthumanism (Braidotti 2013), and affect and posthumanism (Ahmed 2014; Stewart 2007) and digital performance cultures (Harris & Holman Jones 2016; Harris 2016). Chen (2012) tells us that as an adjective, animate means \u201cendowed with life, living, alive\u201d; \u201clively, having the full activity of life\u201d; \u201cpertaining to what is endowed with life; connected to animals\u201d; and \u201cdenoting living beings\u201d (p. 3). But as contemporary bioethics scholars and scientists know, pinpointing the moment of life, or the moment of death, is not simple or black and white. Perhaps Chen\u2019s return to the Latin adjectival definition of live or animate comes closer to our needs, one which centers \u201cto breathe, to quicken; f. anima air, breath, life, soul, mind\u201d (2012, p. 3), echoing Mary Shelley\u2019s measure of \u201clife\u201d in the monster in Frankenstein, a definition by which breath equals life. Chen chooses animacy over \u201clife or liveness\u201d because Using animacy as a central construct... helps us theorize current anxieties around the production of humanness in contemporary times, particularly with regard to humanity\u2019s partners in definitional crime: animality (as its analogue or limit), nationality, race, security, environment, and sexuality. Animacy activates new theoretical formations that trouble and undo stubborn binary systems of difference, including dynamism/stasis, life/death, subject/object, speech/non speech, human/animal, natural/body/cyborg. In its more sensitive figurations, animacy has the capacity to rewrite conditions of intimacy, engendering different communalisms and revising biopolitical spheres, or at least, how we might theorize them. (2012, p. 3) As we explore in chapter 3, the politics of new materialism and posthumanism brings into new formations of Haraway\u2019s (2008) \u201cmaking killable\u201d; grappling with questions of life and death are not only human concerns, but extend to other animals, the planet, and objects as well.4 In his 2003 text on \u201cqueer materialism\u201d in theatre, David Savran asserts that \u201ctheatre is not and has never been a form of mass culture\u201d (p. 18) (although outfits like Cirque du Soleil might disagree). Savran decouples \u201cgay and lesbian theatre\u201d of the 1990s from contemporary queer theatre, which he claims performs a wholly different function. Savran returns to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick\u2019s (1993) foundational definition of queer as polysemy: \u201c\u2018Queer\u2019 can refer to: the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone\u2019s gender, of anyone\u2019s sexuality aren\u2019t made (or can\u2019t be made) to signify monolithically\u201d (p. 8). Savran\u2019s use of queer in a move to \u201cqueer\u201d the theatre offers a blueprint for the way we are queering recent posthuman and new materialist theorising. A rejection of binaries is at the core of queer theory, and a rejection of human/nonhuman (or animal/nonanimal), animate/ inanimate, live/dead5 binaries are too the \u201ccore business\u201d of new materialism. It\u2019s more than a shift to \u201cdecenter\u201d the human; rather the shift is to see the human as always and already entangled with other animal bodies, organisms, terra, and things. For us, new materialism and posthumanism offers multiple opportunities to queer time, event, bodies, and matter, and indeed points to its inherent non monotheism. We use queer as a way of relating that pulls open the mesh in ways that can only be stitched together imperfectly, tracing \u201ca few of the uncountable and generative entanglements in their ongoing reconfiguring\u201d (Barad 2015, p. 407). This is the ontological promise or utopia of new materialism. THE QUEER LIFE OF THINGS Chen (2012) acknowledges the hierarchies, or levels, of animacies that surround us; they offer a heuristic which \u201cconceptually arranges human life, disabled life, animal life, plant life, and forms of nonliving material in orders of value and priority\u201d (p. 13). We argue the ways in which animal, plant, and other forms of life are enacting interconnected and nuanced ways of being \u201calive,\u201d often more so that their human animal others. In a hegemonic notion of liveness, humans are central; and yet, perhaps not surprisingly, pressure cracks have appeared. Humans do not always act in ways that are animate, or full of life, but are demonstrably more tethered to Achille Mbeme\u2019s notion of \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d in which populations are divided into the living and the dead (2003, p. 17). Necropolitics describes the \u201cway certain bodies are seen as either already dead or destined towards death; their lives are of little consequence... their deaths consolidate sovereign power\u201d (Martin Baron 2014, p. 51). One way of responding\u2014hopefully and humbly\u2014to such contemporary systems of detention, domination, and \u201cmaking killable,\u201d which impact queer and other minoritarian \u201cothers\u201d with ever increasing frequency and ferocity, is to turn, as we do here, to animals, plants, and ecosystems to understand the queer notion of life, liveness, and liveliness beyond the human. Queer Things at the Intersections New materialism and posthumanism have shifted attention to the affective relationships not only between humans in a range of contexts, but also between humans and our non human others, including animals, objects, and ecologies. The new materialist turn also signals more expansive attention to ecological assemblages, both networked and sustainable, in ways that are multiply place and spacetime oriented (Manning 2013). Here we extend such \u2018queering\u2019 of cultures, performances, and objects (Ahmed 2014; Halberstam 2011) into a queering of networks, lifeworlds, and ecologies of practice (Manning and Massumi 2014; Barrett & Bolt 2014). It is important to remember not only the areas of inquiry here, but also the intersections. In particular, this text addresses the cross pollination between queer theory and affect and performance studies, and extends these discourses into new materialist considerations of the posthuman and more than human. These intersections are not just a \u201cmash up\u201d of discourses or streams of enquiry; the intersections themselves are intra actions in which new knowledge occurs as event. The text means to move outside the binaries produced by the \u201chabit of parsing the world into dull matter (it, things) and vibrant life (us, beings)\u201d (Bennett 2010, p. vii) and seeks to do so by attuning to the ways in which objects play an agentic role in the performance of everyday life (Massumi 2015, 2002; Conquergood 2002; Stewart 2013a, 2013b, 2010, 2007). Crossing disciplinary boundaries allows us to highlight the layering of activities and orientations that characterize theoretical and practical interventions into these ontologies. New materialist, affect, and posthumanist conceptual frameworks, for example, celebrate fluidity of meaning, feeling, and representation including critical autoethnography and postrepresentational approaches (see, for example, Vannini 2015; Harris 2015; Steyerl & Olivieri 2013; Stemfeld & Zjaja 1997; Holman Jones & Adams 2010). We explore the affective power of \u2018things\u2019 to not only interrogate new ways of performing subjectivities in a posthuman era, but also new queer understandings of digital and machine body performance and machine augmented spaces, places, and ecologies (Holman Jones & Harris 2015; Clough 2012; Anderson & Harrison 2010; Beauchamp 2009; Thrift 2008). One of the things we are asking you, our reader, to consider is the rela tionality of things and things with humans and other animals, rather than to consider the more than human in isolation (the thingness of things, alone, however possible that might be). In other words, in writing this book, we want to consider what taking up nonhuman perspectives and attuning to things might offer us in understanding the relationships, ecologies, and the new performative possibilities our worlds. Catriona Mortimer Sandilands and Bruce Erickson open the collection Queer Ecologies: Sex, Nature, Politics, Desire (2010) by noting the intersections between queer formations of diverse kinds, geo political ecologies, and animals. This intersectional lens allows more than an acknowledgement that space, place, and temporality matter in queering nature or queering humans\u2019 presence in nature. They suggest rather that it is important to identify this intersection as an important point of conversation between queer and ecological politics because they reveal he powerful ways in which understandings of nature inform dis courses of sexuality, and also the ways in which understandings of sex inform discourses of nature; they are linked, in fact, through a strongly evolutionary narrative that pits the perverse, the polluted and the degenerate against the fit, the healthy and the natural, (p. 2 3) They compile a range of essays which understands and articulates the intersections between queer formations of diverse kinds, geo political ecologies, and animals, as we have tried to do in this book. For us it is not so generative to turn the eye away from the human, but rather to put the human back in its place, a simple co participant in the cosmic queer ecology. The development of new materialism and posthumanism also allows us to think more broadly about non human and more than human assemblages as affective nodes (Stewart 2007; Siegworth & Gregg 2010) of both doing and also being becoming. Where phenomenological studies of materialism (for example, Ahmed 2014) have sought to understand things more deeply through an affective consideration of their impact (primarily on humans), in this text we aim to celebrate and entangle ourselves in the \u201cthingness\u201d of objects, moving away from strictly human considerations and queering the performance of new materialism in scholarly practice. Sara Ahmed (2014) has detailed the ways in which objects can perform love relationships and indeed intensities with humans. For example, in a consideration of the breaking of an object (a pot) in George Eliot\u2019s novel Silas Marner, Ahmed writes, Silas is touched by his pot. Silas is not only shaped by the objects in his life he even takes their shape... it is not simply Silas\u2019s conscious appreciation of the pot\u2019s \u201cpotness\u201d that registers the pot\u2019s significance as company, or as a \u201ccompanion species\u201d to borrow Donna Haraway\u2019s (2003) helpful expression for describing helpful encounters. Whether or not Silas is conscious of the pot, of its thingness; the pot matters. (2014) The pot matters because it allows Silas to complete a task, and in doing so, to \u201cactualize a possibility together\u201d (Ahmed 2014). In this text, however, we celebrate the pot\u2019s thingness whether it assists anyone or any other thing (in particular, humans) in completing any practice or action. What is the performance (in this example) of potness, or the pot\u2019s thingness, without human subjectivity, companionship, or performance? What might the pot become, without human mediation? The pot, we argue, has its own affect and is engaged in a practice, whether it is observably a performance with or for any human collaborator or audience. That is, we advance in this book a logic of thingness which is not, as Karen Barad insists, that objects have the kind of agency we decide to map onto them, but rather agency as per Bruno Latour\u2019s actants in which objects have an agency that may not yet be recognisable to humans. We articulate it as thing thought, one in which objects are in relation to one another, carrying on with each other without regard to what the human animals might be thinking or doing or feeling in relation to those worldings. In the series editor\u2019s preface to Queering the Non/Human, Michael O\u2019Rourke quotes Jean Francois Lyotard\u2019s question \u201ccan thought go on without a body?\u201d and muses that the editors of that book, Noreen Giffney and Myra J. Hird persuade us to question whether thought can go on not without the human but without the mythic understanding of the human as foundational, natural, of the bio anthropological as the degree zero of the human. For Giffney and Hird, thinking begins not just there with the animal, as it does for Jacques Derrida, but with all non/human others, and with the reframing of traditional forms of humanism to make way for the becoming human of humanity, its hominisation. Such a theoretical claim is incredibly sustaining but also remarkably difficult for many to accept. (2016, p. xviii) In contemplating such \u201cunobservable\u201d practices, however, we suggest that a queer lens is required in order for non things (such as humans) to experience (even affectively) and comment upon such non human experiences. A Queer Story of Things We take up current considerations and uses of new materialism and posthumanism by linking the affective worlds of objects with performance and relationships of queer objects through their non human acts. Aijun Appadurai\u2019s (1986) analysis of commodity culture suggests that the thingness of thing\u2019s agency goes beyond use value circulation logics. It is helpful to critique the limitations of use value and commodity logics, not only for a fuller understanding of the ways objects diverge from such flows, but also for the ways these arguments limit human ability to affectively attach to the things with which we co habit, even eliciting revulsion and fear in the human world toward non human others. As we see ourselves becoming less distinctively different from \u201cthings,\u201d this fear and revulsion threatens our ability to perform selves that are satisfying, compassionate, or empathic. Mortimer Sandilands and Erickson (2010) can be effectively extended by suggesting the need for an integrated analysis of ecologies of practice that stresses the agency and autonomy of inanimate actors and new possibilities for thing time, or what we are calling queer object time. Appadurai argued for the agency of things in themselves, saying \u201cWe have to follow the things themselves, for their meanings are inscribed in their forms, their uses, their trajectories\u201d (1986, p. 5). Performance stud ies, phenomenology, and materialist literatures grappled with many of these same considerations on the way to contemporary posthumanism and new materialism. More recently, Bennett (2010) has argued that both affect and narrative are constitutive, in that affective states can be felt, and also participate in the creation of characters, stories, and theses (Bennett 2002, p. 3). A story of things, she says, \u201ccontribute[s] to the condition it describes. Its rhetorical power has real effects\u201d (2002, p. 4). She calls us to a contemporary retelling of enchantment, evidenced by things such as \u201cthe discovery of sophisticated modes of communication among nonhumans, the strange agency of physical systems at far from equilibrium states, and the animation of objects by video technologies\u201d (p. 4). Affect is tangled up with \u201ctime and bodily movement\u201d (Bennett, p. 5; see also Manning 2013; Massumi 2002; Haraway 2008; Oliver 2008; Stewart 2007), but where and how are the roles of things in such human centered considerations? Likewise, scholars including Ahmed (2014) ask us to attend to an object\u2019s relationality, but often in relation to human orientations and concerns. Following Chen (2012) and Barad (2003, 2015), this book attends and attunes to the intersecting forces of bodies, affect, time and performance in the life of things. If Barad\u2019s (2003) notion of the co emergence of all things in intra active events is to objects what Butler\u2019s (1999) performativity was to gender construction, the assemblage and the reiterative nature of all encounters is at stake. Here we argue that in queer thing time, humans and other animals, organisms, terra, and objects intra act in queer convergence, co destructing teleological notions of evolution and species hierarchies. In Queering the Non/Human, Michael O\u2019Rourke (2016) suggests that a nonhuman reorientation, which \u201cshakes all our certainties is, we might say, a queer phenomenology\u201d (p. xix). A queer phenomenology in which Ahmed (2006) and Haraway (2008) asserted the value of disorientation, is a kind of disorientation in which things can be as out of place or lose place as profoundly as human disorientations. Proximity between things and humans is an affective relationship in which both are changed; the fate of human and nonhuman actors (or actants, per Latour 1993) are inexorably intertwined. In this book we advance a narrative in which humans are inextricable from our planetary cohabitants, yet in an ecology that we can admit does not need us. A willingness, we would argue, to relinquish power requires a recognition (if not orientation toward) of other forms of knowing, being, as well as real recognition of a need for species diversity. This is not, as Haraway (2016) has written, an exercise in \u201canimal rights\u201d but rather in co relating in which both human and animal (or any other nonhuman entity) is not only liberated from discourses and practices of oppression by humans, but whose equality (if difference) is truly acknowledged. Haraway recognizes the difficulty of this for humans, no matter how well we theorize it: The discursive tie between the colonised, the enslaved, the non citizen and the animal all reduced to type, all others to rational man, and all essential to his bright constitution is at the heart of racism and, lethally, flourishes in the entrails of humanism. (Haraway 2016b, p. xxiv) With our fellow travellers on this terrain, we write not just about animals, objects and ecologies, but with and becoming with them. Yet the interest in posthuman and new materialist theories would suggest that this is not such a \u201cqueer\u201d premise anymore. Haraway does not let \u201cus\u201d off the hook, preferring the term \u2018\u201ccompanion species\u2019 instead of human/nonhuman or humanism and its various prefixes. Queering has the job of undoing \u2018normal\u2019 categories, and none is more critical than the \u201chuman/nonhuman sorting operation\u201d (Haraway 2016b, p. xxiv). As with queer theory, even more rapidly new materialism and posthumanism are in danger of sliding into more fixed, less disruptive, \u201cexplaining\u201d work than they started out wanting to do. Claire Colebrook urges us to think more broadly about what queer might bring to the more than human, and conversely what the more than human might do to queer theory: If we think of life beyond constituted bodies, as Elizabeth Grosz does in her re reading of Darwin, Freud and Nietzsche (2004), or as Braidotti does in her notion of metamorphoses and transpositions that can be considered ecologically beyond the human (2002; 2006), then we have a new model of queer politics. (2016, p. 24) If Ahmed\u2019s attention to queering the work of disorienting objects (2006) can be reactivated in new materialism and posthumanism (which is not a far leap from phenomenology), objects must lead our way of understanding what (and how) they can queer life as it is, for all species and life forms. For Ahmed, queer (or becoming queer) is like (in performance studies terms6) \u201cthings becoming strange\u201d (Ahmed 2006, p. 163). That is, a queer life of things suggests, a happening, something that has altered (some)thing, asking us to attend to the \u201cstrangeness that seems to reside somewhere between the body and its objects\u201d (Ahmed 2006, p. 163). This book, we hope, is a happening that makes something queer happen between you the reader, and the world as object. We begin this work in chapter 1, \u201cAffective Objects,\u201d which lays out a theoretical foundation for considering the ways in which affect is able to queer objects, assemblages, and other nonhuman subjects (Ahmed 2014, 2006; Barad 2007, 2003). Through activist affect and the queer fade, artifacts perform affects and intensities that remain independent of human interaction, and sometimes of human observation. This chapter argues that a reconceptualization of the dynamism and animacy of nonhuman worlds is crucial to moving beyond the humanist straightjacket which Barad has problematized as a need for critiquing the latest binary, non/humanism. Following Barad (2003), and Deleuze & Guattari (1987), we argue that we experience objects, animals, and nonhuman subjects as animate and animating agents that refig ure our understanding of the queerly performative possibilities of \u201cthings in phenomena\u201d (Barad 2003, p. 817). Chapter 2, \u201cQueering the Archive,\u201d draws on artifacts from the art world\u2014 Van Gogh\u2019s chair portraits of himself and Gaugin as well as the posthumanist sculptures of Patricia Piccinini, in addition to the Internet of Things (IoT), to explore the notion of the archive, both online and offline. As data lives become more dynamic and more recognizable as living entities, human lives become increasingly intelligible as data. This chapter considers an ethics of accumulation and the ways in which life is lived as a curational event rather than a cumulative one. From fine art to the life of everyday devices, curatorial orientations may serve the machines and technologies themselves rather than performing only an interpretive role for human centered experience. Finally, this chapter wonders whether the contemporary tendency toward archiving and curation is a symptom of consumer/accumulation logics under which human subjectivity still suffers, or points toward a new kind of materialist proxy. We question whether queer materiality might move beyond archiving and curation, and how a turn toward the posthuman might offer new entry points for thinking about the queer lives of things. The productive relationship among objects, queemess and time as an entanglement of matter and meaning is the subject of chapter 3, \u201cQueer Object Time.\u201d Rather that invert the focus on the human body and language (or it\u2019s \u201coutside\u201d) in favor of an anti anthropomorphic fascination with objects in and of themselves, we write to engage the messy, vibrant, and thoroughly queer relation we have to bodies, objects and time. Queer object time offers an encounter that rejects human/nonhuman binaries, seeing objects and humans as co existent events rather than ontological categories in competition for resources or recognition. As event, the becoming object of queer object time is invested in reconfiguring and regenerating what might yet be. Chapter 4, \u201cQueer Ecologies\u201d attunes to contemporary theorizations of the Anthropocene (or current human influenced period on Earth), arguing that natureculture is not only inseparable and entangled, but also always already queer, humming outside of any tidy humanist narrative of progress and coherence. In particular the chapter shows how feminist new materialist approaches lead us to more embodied, situated, and differentiated approaches to understanding anthropogenic climate (and other) change, ideas that are urgently needed to create the kinds of radical change necessary for reconfiguring the systemic genocidal and toxic poisoning of the earth as organism, as well as the ecologies it sustains. Thinking queerly about the ecological interrelationships between the more than human (with and without considerations of the human itself) shows us, as Chen (2012) observes, how the queering of objects and affects is often \u201caccompanied by political revision, reworldings that challenge the order of things\u201d (p. 237). In this chapter, we use the reworlding potential of queer ecologies to suggest new lives of things that have implications for the human, even as they no longer require our participation. The closing chapter 5, \u201cQueering Human Animal Kinship,\u201d advances a vision for a queer human animal kinship accomplished not by virtue of generation or descent, but instead through performative and iterative \u201cembodiment and action.\u201d As part of our articulation of queer animal human entanglements, we draw on a range of scholarship about human animal relations including Maurice Merleau Ponty\u2019s notion of our \u201cstrange kinship\u201d with animals (2003) and Haraway\u2019s work on companion species. In particular, we explore the constitutively affirming force of human dog relations, where human and other animals are held and transformed through \u201cshared embodiment and the gestures of love\u201d (Oliver 2008, p. 228). In our worlding, animals (specifically dogs) not only offer queers a reliable safe haven in a social world populated by dangerous and unsafe humans and institutions but also a performative way of queerly and lovingly turning kinship animal. TO BEGIN We might begin to see the process of queering or queering with objects, things, animals, organisms, and the kaleidoscope of more than human others, as a new kind of process ontology... we open ourselves up to the sense of the world, are vulnerably exposed to the future, but are all singular plural, not substantial, settled, or stable subjects, but singular beings in a relational regime independent of identitarianism or anthropomorphism. Our transimmanence, or allness, a being with towards others, all others, brings about new modes of sociability. (O\u2019Rourke 2016, p. xviii) So, to return, to our opening scene, we offer this book as a way of being with you and other animals and things as a way of creating queer shelter in today\u2019s increasingly \u201cdisoriented,\u201d alienated, and in some (perhaps many) annihilating flows. Our interest in things and their queemess is not an objectifying fetish, it is a relational one. How does the queemess of other things reinforce the incredible plurality of our own queemess, and the promises therein? The pursuit of the thingness leads us back to relationship. Perhaps, returning to Beckett, we\u2019ve had a relationship all along. Perhaps, for all our words, nothing is new. Perhaps the other animals and the \u201cnatural\u201d world has always understood this, the futility (and futurity) of no words. Perhaps, as Beckett said, we just return to the knowledge that \u201cThe sun shone, having no alternative, on the nothing new\u201d (1938, p. 1). NOTES 1. In their original contribution to scholarship on the animate, Chen\u2019s Animacies (2012) \u201crethinks the criteria governing agency and receptivity, health and toxicity, productivity and stillness.\u201d Chen is someone with a disability around toxicity, and this book brings together posthumanism and queer along the trajectory of fleshbodies, and for this reason the micro to the macro analysis of human and more than human flows is effectively integrated. Some readers may imagine it not directly relevant to their own experience if \u201cabled\u201d is how anyone self orients. But we suggest that those who find Chen\u2019s disability lens not relevant to ableism are like those who find queer culture not relevant to mainstream culture. Subaltern culture not relevant to colonial culture. The minoritarian, the subaltern, the diasporic, the abject is no longer irrelevant to the hegemony. We are remaking the hegemony, and we hope the text you are holding is a contribution to that reworlding. 2. Bennett\u2019s (2010) notion of vibrant materiality was foreshadowed by Louis Althusser as \u201ca process that has no subject\u201d (p. 91), opening the possibility of crossing the subject/object divide when considering the primacy of the event in more recent new materialist terms. 3. Shortly after taking office on January 24, 2017, President Donald Trump reversed the Obama administration\u2019s block of the pipeline, and signed a presidential memorandum to advance construction. The Dakota Access Pipeline protests are grassroots movements that began in early 2016 in reaction to the approved construction of Energy Transfer Partners\u2019 Dakota Access Pipeline in the northern United States, particularly led by Souix tribal custodians who occupied the site at Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North and South Dakota. The first oil was delivered through the pipeline on May 14, 2017. Even before starting commercial operations several leaks occurred. On March 3, 2017, 84 U.S. gallons (2.0 barrels; 0.32 cubic meters) of oil leaked at the terminal of the feeder line in North Dakota. (Wikipedia). 4. See also Jasbir Puar\u2019s (2007) \u201cbio necro\u201d political analysis, which \u201cconceptually acknowledges [Foucauldian] biopower\u2019s direct activity in death, while remaining bound to the optimization of life, and [Mbembe\u2019s] necropolitic\u2019s nonchalance toward death even as it seeks out killing as a primary aim\u201d (2007, p 35). 5. It is possible in these spaces to theorize liveness not in terms of the old dead/ alive binary or even in some ways via liveness; we find Chen\u2019s use of animacy generative and understand language to be central to the new materialist project rather than participating in what some have come to understand as a material/discursive binary. 6. For Bertolt Brecht, the \u201calienation/distancing effect\u201d was a way of making the familiar strange in theatre and provoking sociocultural critique in his audience, rather than catharsis. Also known as Verfremdungseffekt, or V effect, he adopted and extended the idea from Russian formalist theatre practitioners (Brecht 2014/1964, p. 151). Chapter One Affective Objects QUEER AND ITS AFFECTS Interest in the relationship between affect and queer has been growing in a range of disciplines and geopolitical regions for nearly two decades. There has been substantial scholarship in recent times that has questioned queer theory through affect and affect via queer theory.1 A general queering of the object or nonhuman might start with Ahmed\u2019s Queer Phenomenology (2006), Hird & Giffney\u2019s (2016) Queering the non/human, Mortimer Sandilands & Erickson\u2019s (2010) Queering Ecologies, and Chen & Luciano\u2019s Queer Inhumanisms (2015) which includes essays by several theorists from a range of disciplines decentering the human in queer theory. This recent work brings us to an explosion in queer perspectives of the nonhuman, and queer as a pivot for pushing explorations into new materialism and posthumanism further than it currently sits. Importantly, though, this book queers these theoretics by way of affect and performance theory. A messy or (what Haraway and Ahmed would call) disorienting intersection to be sure, but one we have found exciting and future focused. What makes an object queer? Is it their sticky attachments, a queer resonance, history or use? Guy Davidson and Monique Rooney (2018) explore the global interest in queer lives and objects in a time of terror and foreclosure of human rights. For us, queer lives and affects offer an antidote to the reign of \u201cdehumanizing\u201d capital, and the global war on refugees, poverty, precarity and neoliberal notions of relationality. Attention to queer affect has been growing across multiple disciplines within the academy and more broadly, reflecting some of the tensions and opportunities we explore in this chapter. Broad general agreement may ex ist only in that affect and its adherents respond to the body, the power of embodiment, and emergence. Affect studies are included within the suite of non representational theoretics, and, like queer theory, attempts to surpass teleological explanations for, or foreclosures of, experience. It is, above all else, emergent and pre linguistic. But how does affect serve our investigation into queer objects and their relationships with the human? Brian Massumi\u2019s affect is \u201cthe capacity to affect or be affected,\u201d as an engagement, an encounter (2015, p. 91). Mas sumi places affect in an intersubjective, inter relational space that is both interactive and primarily physical, concrete and corporeal, and yet can still be considered to be constrained by a binary approach to the us/them space of becoming in which, as transcendence, intersubjectivity presumes a preexisting subject/s which come/s together in the encounter (see also Barad 2007; 2003). Deleuze\u2019s (2001) articulation of immanence rejects this binary, as we will explore in the next section. For us, queer objects and queer affects are immanent in their ability to move beyond preexisting selves and identities (even as objects). Queer objects, in this articulation, are more a becoming (or a becoming with) than a thing. Like our colleagues, we are called to examine the intersection between affect, queer, and the material (or new material), and in the rest of this first chapter we will look at some ways in which others have brought these thoughts together, followed by our own understandings of queer objects, their queer affects, and what they suggest for a queer way forward in which the sociocultural includes all matter, not just the matter that can articulate how and why it matters in language (Barad 2015, 2012). IMMANENCE, TRANSCENDENCE AND THE MATERIAL Immanence and Materialism Two theorists who are often \u201cmashed up\u201d in new materialist and new empiricist scholarly literature are Karen Barad and Gilles Deleuze. Serge F. Hein (2016) contrasts them by citing an \u201cincommensurability\u201d of their theorizations of immanence and transcendence, an analysis which provides a useful way in to these two core concepts for understanding materiality and the ways in which it is currently shifting. Deleuze\u2019s \u201cplane of immanence\u201d and Barad\u2019s \u201cagential realism\u201d form the cornerstones of each theorist\u2019s central conceptual framework and represent conflicting ontologies. While Deleuze is a self identified materialist, and uses a wide range of physical imagery, his materialism differs from the more mainstream Anglo American materialism of modernist philosophy, tradition ally humanist and interior. He contrasts modernist thought from poststructuralist thought in the different ways they decenter the human subject and understand immanence (Deleuze 2001), pivoting on a mutual moving away from the unhelpful binary of modernism in which immanence was about in teriority, and transcendence about exteriority (or a going beyond). Deleuze\u2019s conceptualization of materialism and immanence is quite distinct from others who increasingly use these terms. Conventional materialism claims to be able to reduce all \u201cprocesses or realities\u201d to their more fundamental constituents, such as molecules and atoms (i.e., \u201cthe molecular sphere\u201d). In this way, matter (i.e., physical nature) is reduced to a single stratum, the molecular. Yet Deleuze rejects this \u201creductive molecular materialism,\u201d and instead preserves each stratum of reality, without prioritizing one stratum over another, by materializing the \u201cmolar sphere without reducing it to the molecular,\u201d which he describes as \u201cuniversal machinism\u201d (Deleuze & Guattari 1987, p. 90). Surprisingly perhaps, Deleuze\u2019s materialism lacks any direct relationship with conventional materialism. Nevertheless, Deleuze\u2019s radical materialism has the advantage of avoiding the false material/immaterial binary, and \u201cimmanence itself is the necessary condition for all of life (understood as including both the material and the immaterial) in its becoming\u201d (Hein 2016, p. 3). Deleuze and Guattari uniquely formulate a \u201cplane of immanence,\u201d in which there can be no two world ontology; rather, a \u201cpure plane of immanence\u201d (1987, p. 311) that must be constant and irreducible. For Deleuze and Guattari, there is no separation between immanence and transcendence, no false representational or perspectival difference. Wherever immanence is theorized as immanent to something, there is transcendence, so Deleuze and Guattari warn us away from that kind of notion of immanence. For them, immanence is immanent only to itself and is therefore complete. Further, De leuzian chaos is \u201cformless, but it is not undifferentiated\u201d (Parr 2010, p. 48). Can chaos serve to queer the ontological reorientation of new materialism or posthumanism, without abandoning language? In affective terms it can, as embodying both the material and the immaterial, as immanence is both a becoming (event) and a condition (material). Yet Barad\u2019s critique of language offers transcendence as the event, the reliable, the liberated from language state of human conceptions of agency. Transcendence Transcendence has in conventional philosophy been associated with/arisen from theology. Barad\u2019s notion of agential realism (2007) is a philosophy of identity, and it establishes a two world ontology. Barad believes that language has been given too much power, that matter and materiality is always subsumed into a linguistic domain for its very being, and that we should not accept that. \u201cFor Barad, agential realism avoids privileging discursive considerations over material ones and instituting the nature/culture dualism that she discerns in work such as Butler\u2019s (1990,1993). She critiques how she thinks discourse has replaced \u2018reality\u2019\u201d (Hein 2016, p. 4). Barad\u2019s philosophy of agential realism (2007) looks on the surface like a \u201crealist philosophy\u201d whereas Deleuze\u2019s is a \u201cphilosophy of immanence.\u201d However, a closer look shows that Barad\u2019s philosophy \u201cavoids reinscribing a material/discursive dichotomy (i.e., a material/immaterial) binary. Instead, the material and the discursive are mutually implicated in a process of intraaction\u201d (Hein 2016, p. 4). Barad says that neither material phenomena nor discursive practices are \u201contologically or epistemologically prior. Neither can be explained in terms of the other... matter and meaning are mutually articulated\u201d (2007, p. 152). One does not exist before or outside of the other. Barad\u2019s articulation of intra action (\u201cthe mutual constitution of entangled agencies\u201d) (2007, p. 33) is different from interaction because interaction presumes pre existing things that then come into contact. In intra action there is no pre existence, only the encounter, the entanglement. Agency bears a close relationship to intra action (Barad, 2007). For us, Barad\u2019s articulation of agency and agential realism offers intriguing possibilities for a kind of \u201cqueer agency.\u201d For example, if Barad rejects an im/material binary, then via Deleuze her re theorization of agency serves to queer Deleuze\u2019s notion of immanence. Barad tells us that in agential realism, agency neither is limited to humans, nor is it simply expanded to include nonhumans or other forms of agency that have both human and nonhuman elements. Rather, the human and nonhuman are seen as not fixed, so that agency encompasses all the possibilities for reconfiguring the materiality of these and other forms, (in Hein 2016, p. 5) We read this as a queering of the notions of human and nonhuman more generally, and an invitation to reconceive of matter and materiality in human and more than human forms and events as always fluid, always becoming. Barad and Deleuze differ significantly in the ways in which they articulate \u201cbecoming,\u201d \u201cdifferentiating,\u201d and even how they address the beyond hu man. Agential realism, Barad says, provides a posthumanist performative account of technoscientific and other naturalcultural practices. By \u201cposthumanist\u201d I mean to signal the crucial recognition that nonhumans play an important role in naturalcultural practices, including everyday social practices, scientific practices, and practices that do not include humans. But also, beyond this, my use of \u201cposthumanism\u201d marks a refusal to take the distinction between \u201chuman\u201d and \u201cnonhuman\u201d for granted, and to found analyses on this presumably fixed and inherent set of categories. (Barad 2007, p. 32) Although Barad rejects the traditional human/nonhuman binary, she uses the term \u201cposthuman\u201d to encompass both the \u201cnonhuman\u201d and \u201chuman\u201d and thus remains entirely within the sphere of (binarized interior/exterior) transcendence. In contrast, Deleuze and Guattari (1987) use the term \u201cprehuman,\u201d conceptually similar to the posthuman in poststructuralist thought. Deleuze\u2019s is a philosophy of immanence and difference, while Barad\u2019s is a philosophy of transcendence and identity. Barad\u2019s is more closely aligned with conventional materialism. If \u201cBarad\u2019s matter is not virtual or formless, as understood within Deleuze\u2019s philosophy, and her becoming is not Deleuze\u2019s immanent becoming,\u201d then there can be no genesis \u201ceven if understood in the form of intra action\u2014on the plane of immanence,\u201d (Hein 2016, p. 6). Barad retains the binary: from the perspective of a philosophy of difference, even if matter and discourse are mutually constituted or articulated, as Barad asserts, a binary logic is still implicitly at work (i.e., the mattcr/discoursc binary has not been undone). Deleuze sees all as difference, Barad as identity, and intraaction as an \u201cidentity.\u201d The persistence of the binaiy, however, is not just a humanist problem, or construct. Some new materialist thinkers are certainly pursuing the goal of ridding ourselves of the binary, but some are not. Remember Haraway\u2019s irritation with the whole posthumanist project and her injunction to become \u201ccompostists.\u201d Even those who work to redeploy, twist, or queer the binaiy, reify it in so doing. So what are the implications of these differences, for this chapter and our discussion here of queer, affect, and objects, or the material more generally? We believe that non binaiy enactments of material agency\u2014that is, the agency of objects\u2014offer openings for escaping binaries completely, including agentic/non agentic ones. As Latour has theorized, actants, in this text we explore different approaches to the possibility that queer catalyzes the notion of agency for affect and new materialist scholars\u2014that is, a nonhuman agency might not resemble human agency in the least. Rather, nonhuman agency is an agentic resonance, including Barad\u2019s agental realism, that moves beyond nature/culture or material/discursive debates, or indeed any notion of a \u201cpure\u201d idea of agency. If objects have their own lives, but more so have their own impetus linked to affect and emotion, and if a deeper understanding of this complex agency can help us decenter human exceptionalism in ways that are urgently needed, might \u201cqueer\u201d be the thread that makes it through the eye of current new materialist, posthumanist, and affect theory \u201cneedles\u201d? BODIES, MOVEMENT, AND OBJECT(IVE) AFFECTS Ahmed has theorized, through doing, her notion of affect and its relationship to materiality. She writes, \u201cAffect is what sticks, or what sustains or preserves the connection between ideas, values, and objects\u201d (Ahmed 2010, p. 230). For Ahmed, emotion, affect, and materiality are co constitutive, a queer assemblage in which \u201cEmotions are not \u2018after thoughts\u2019 but shape how bodies are moved by the worlds they inhabit\u201d (Ahmed 2010, p. 237). Like Kathleen Stewart, Ahmed stories worlds in which matter is conjured through movement and doing, through a version of Deleuze\u2019s becoming, in ways that understand the symbiotic relationship between objects, intensities, and movement. For example, airplanes are technologies of flight, signalling what goes up and away... you become an individual: you acquire the body of an individual, a body that can move out and can move up.... In other words: in becoming an individual you acquire a sense of freedom.... This is how happiness becomes a forward motion.... To become an individual is to assume an image: becoming free to be happy turns the body in a certain direction. (Ahmed 2010, p. 137) Ahmed helps us understand emotions such as happiness as a doing, an orientation. Stewart (2007) narrates the body/movement relationship as: \u201cThe body surges, out of necessity, or for the love of movement... the body knows itself as states of vitality, immersion, isolation, exhaustion, and renewal\u201d (p. 113). If, for Ahmed, the orientation is the movement of bodies and objects and bodies as objects toward something, calling to mind as it does Manning\u2019s affect as pre acceleration, we suggest that in entanglements such as, for example, queer subjectivities and activist assemblages, the animate and inanimate objects are moving toward one another in dynamic but differently intelligible ways. We see inanimate objects moving toward their collaborators in a kind of queering of an activist affect. To explore intra actions that decenter the human in activist entanglements, we turn to two artefacts: the immanence example of the \u201cactivist bridge\u201d and the transcendence example of the \u201cqueer fade.\u201d THE ACTIVIST BRIDGE The Westminster Bridge in London spans 250 metres across the River Thames, stretching from County Hall and the London Eye on the east to the House of Commons and the Palace of Westminster on the west. Built in 1862, it has kept a strong and silent watch over the brackish water below. While the bridge might seem inanimate, an object made of iron and stone, an affectively queer reading of the Westminster Bridge might suggest a different perspective on its life and the ways in which its own story and the events of history are more actively intertwined than first meets the eye. We turn to the Westminster Bridge in London as one flashpoint in queering how we might do social movements and cultural resistance; the bridge as a material object which agentically seems to suggest (by its presence) new ways of creating activist publics. Consider the bridge as Stewart would, a \u201cspace of shared impact\u201d (Stewart 2007, p. 39). Consider the multitude of experiences a single walker can have on/with the bridge, how it can offer an entry, and exit, a material collaborator or a launch pad into the cold waters below. Consider as well two related events, two affective performances in which the bridge, is a space of shared impact, a crucial player. On March 22, 2017, Kahlid Masood drove through a crowd of tourists walking over the Thames before crashing the gates at Parliament, taking the lives of five people and injuring fifty before he came to a stop. Four days later, scores of Muslim women wearing blue as a symbol of hope, linked arms and formed a human chain of resistance. Without a word, they rejected the driver\u2019s use of the bridge as an instrument of fear. By making a bridge over the bridge, they resisted the business as usual that pretends the car and the driver and the impact they made had never happened. In that simple, silent action, the women and the bridge broadcast to the world a different kind of activist affect. So we ask: If one were to identify an affect of terrorism, and an affect of activism, what might they look like, and might they have more in common than we think? We wonder, in recalling our own crossing of that bridge at a less precarious time, about the affect that sticks to artifacts like the Westminster Bridge, and social movements we believe and participate in. Gregory Siegworth and Melissa Gregg (2010) suggest that \u201cAffect arises in the midst of in between ness: in the capacities to act and be acted upon\u201d (p. 1). In the midst of a workday afternoon\u2014as the women locked arms and the mist of everyday life (and death) swirled below them in the Thames, above them in the clouds, and amongst them on the bridge, they chose to refuse the refusal that is terrorism. Affect \u201cis found in those intensities that pass body to body (human and non human), in those resonances that circulate about, between and sometimes stick to bodies and worlds\u201d (Seigworth & Gregg 2010, p. 1). The bridge is a willful subject, one that plays a role in both the terrorist act, and the activist act (Ahmed 2014). At first blush, both the terrorist act and the activist act have a familiar\u2014 and similar\u2014emotional tenor: angry and defiant. A gathering of emotion that eventuates inevitably into a cathartic public event. The emotionality that drives people to the streets can be galvanizing but threatens to replace long term activism. Aristotle taught us the power of collective emotion and catharsis. But Bertolt Brecht warned us of the danger of replacing sustainable social action with emotional identification and quick fix collective catharsis. And Stewart argues that affect offers us broad ranging ways of exploring \u201cwhat happens to people, how force hits bodies, how sensibilities circulate and become... collective\u201d (2013a, p. 661). In other words, emotion is a circuit, not an endpoint. Butler (2015) reminds us of the power of bodies coming together in public spaces, and the differences between these collective, corporeal acts and other forms of resistance. These are public assemblies that seek to change the material conditions of public spaces, not just \u201csend a message.\u201d The women on the bridge\u2014and the bridge itself\u2014offer us a different kind of activist affect, different kind of action\u2014more particularly a re action that is not reactive, but instead a resistive reclamation of that space. Their agentic, if quiet, refusal might be one way to overcome the danger of syphoning off the energy expended by raging bodies\u2014over and over again\u2014and avoid the battle fatigue we are all feeling now. The overwhelm itself becomes a kind of terrorism, and there\u2019s no time or space for being overwhelmed. Since the proliferation of online/offline social movements and marches across the globe, many have asked how to turn a march into a movement. The women and the bridge pose a slightly different question\u2014how do we turn the energy of a march into a movement? Movement, as Erin Manning has it, is really a question of readiness potential, the \u201cimmanence of movement moving [or] how movement can be felt before it actualizes\u201d (2009, p. 6). So the power of the \u201cevent on the bridge\u201d is a suggestion of how to keep that movement moving. Their re action involves taking a stand on and with others. The bridge becomes a player on the human stage\u2014it is not only public space, it is a public body that keeps the immanence of movement moving. Hannah Ar endt argues that politics is bodies acting together (1958/2013). The women and the bridge connect\u2014the \u201csingularity\u201d of one person\u2019s experience and one event\u2019s meaning in time into what Massumi (2002) describes as a \u201cvital movement\u201d that can be \u201ccollectively spread\u201d (p. 250). And although the women filed off the bridge that day in March as darkness fell, the energy they set in motion remains, not just as a memory but also as a future\u2014in the readiness potential of a march that becomes a movement. In standing with the bridge and not only on it, linking arms in solidary over the brackish water below. Return to the bridge, night falls, the bridge has been changed\u2014set in motion by the women, the movement of the brackish water below, the terrorist appropriation dissipates. Places have memory. And they have an ability to shift the future. Story is not just memory but becoming. Women formed a bridge on a bridge to tomorrow, becoming the bridge in solidary with the bridge, in both public memory and the future. How does the story change when the object is queerly in charge? How might a shift from the humanist subject to the object subject help re center relationality over the hierarchical oppression of the relentlessly humanist project of scholarship? For Stewart, the activists in the story above are human objects in service to the bridge, and this kind of event/entanglement/ action is \u201cthe daydream of a subject... who is literally touched by a force and tries to take it on, to let it puncture and possess one, to make oneself its object, if only in passing\u201d (p. 116). For Stewart, it is an everyday occurrence, an experiment that starts with sheer intensity and tries to find routes into a \u201cwe\u201d that is not yet there but maybe could be. It\u2019s a facility with imagining the potential in things that comes to people not despite the fact that it\u2019s unlikely anything good will come of it but rather because of that fact. It\u2019s as if the subject of extreme vulnerability turns a dream of possible lives into ordinary affects so real they become paths one can actually travel on. (2007, p. 116) If we can imagine an activist project in which the very power of it is that nothing \u201cgood\u201d will ever come of it, and our vulnerabilities become the tangible/material roads upon which we walk, then the activist bridge is an allegory for the ways in which not only humanist subjects can experience these ordinary affects, but more than human subjects can, in entanglements, conjure experience and perform such ordinary affects in/as the material roads upon which we walk. These \u201cinanimate\u201d objects can themselves begin to show us what an activist affect might be. An ordinary activist affect, a road to \u201cno good\u201d beyond itself. IDENTIFYING AN ACTIVIST AFFECT Yet another way of understanding affect is offered to us by Manning, as the force of \u201cmovement moving\u201d (2009). This can and does occur in not only humanist subjects but all subjects. If an activist affect can be understood as not only a becoming movement, but also as a remaining, organic and inorganic things are activists by their very presence in a world that would just as soon see the back of us/them, a world that would prefer to forget about connection, emotion, and memory itself. A world that increasingly fetishizes newness and innovation but has made no progress on integrating the artefact, the remnant, the survivor. Human and nonhuman collaborators such as the activists and the bridge change the social and cultural air and world, and in so doing changes our movement from the outside in, and the inside out, all at the same time. This is immanence, in which there is no prioritising of one over another, of outside over inside, of human over others. We are interested in looking more closely at the ways in which \u201cactivism\u201d is presumed to be (always, already) empathic, wondering when and how activism is more like an affect, an intensity, a sensation (Massumi 2002). The Muslim women who locked arms on the bridge in London were not there to show empathy (though surely, they were doing that), they were doing it to show resistance, to have an effect, to create an affective ripple. A humanist affect for contemporary activism can hover between such un nuanced spaces as \u201crage\u201d and \u201coutrage fatigue,\u201d a kind of war weariness that is now dispersed and \u201cdemocratized\u201d through social media engagement with the rolling waves of activist reactions to globally relentless terrorist and other violences. In this new digital/virtual ability to be \u201cactive\u201d to global violations and violences, and the still emotion driven nature of social media engagements, as well as face to face engagements on the street, it is important to interrogate the place of catharsis. Brecht\u2019s alienation effect (in German, Verfremdungseffekt, see introduction) of making the familiar strange in order to provoke a more critical audience response and avoid a simple cathartic release that, Brecht felt, pacified the audience\u2014or rather, redirected their rage and falsely released it before real social activism or social change could be achieved. In this way, Brecht felt that catharsis was an enemy of social activism. We too question whether \u201csimple activism\u201d of marches, social media exchanges and circulations dissipates the energy/ force/emotion that must be retained to drive sustained social movements. Managing emotion becomes part of an activist agenda or activist ethics of care as we seek to move from a march to a movement. Yet what about those who do not wish to move into something more coherent, more sustainable? Or those who don\u2019t wish to find words for the intensities that drive them into and out of sociality? Can activism create affect strong enough to move past anything like empathy or emotions, to move the body directly into action without a need for \u201crage,\u201d resentments, us/them logics, or discourse even of forgiveness, all limited by the rhetoric and discourses of emotion? Or is affect is attached to instinct more than feeling or emotion? To the ripple that breaks the flow of the ordinary, rather than the disaster? Indeed, for Deleuze, \u201caffect is in many ways synonymous with force or forces of encounter... affect more often transpires within and across the subtlest of shuttling intensities: all the miniscule... events of the unnoticed. The ordinary\u201d (Murphie 2014, n.p.). Answering these questions means tuning into the intensities and instincts shuttling between and among the driver, the rental car, the dead bodies, the houses of parliament, the women, and the bridge. The uniqueness of an event, and its particular affect, is contingent upon and embedded within its own pe culiar time, place, and action (Harris 2015). In affective moments, sites and encounters like these, an assemblage of people, weather, objects, time both past and future, and feeling in the present moment combine to send a metaphysical refusal of terrorism out into spacetime (Manning; for more on this see chapter 3). The \u201ccollective emergence of tactical performance charged by public, communal action,\u201d one in which feelings, emotions, and bodies and things \u201cbecome palpable, viscerally pressing forth\u201d (Madison 2010, p. 5) generates both activist and affective reverberations that ripple around, through, and up against the impenetrability of terrorism. So too can the animacy of terrorism be seen as a wall, abutted by our wall, and the quiet actions of the women and the bridge be felt as a pulse of small tremors that might topple the wall, piece by piece, bit by bit. Even as we feel the force of activist affect and its power to pull down the wall of terror, we also feel a growing inability to experience affect in a world of increasing outrage, despair, alienation, and suspicion. These are sensations as well as emotions all doing different work. If one were to formulate a posthuman affect of terrorism, and an affect of activism, what might they look like? Would they look? Looking to the bridge, the car, the Houses of Parliament: The driver never tried to get Theresa May, the prime minister. Still, the car speeding along Bridge Street, near the Houses of Parliament, gives it a different weight, the car a different kind of acceleration. How does the location give the act a different weight, and acceleration a different vibrancy? Contrast that with the women who stood their \u201cground,\u201d on the bridge, seemingly alienated although proximate with parliament, who got no response from parliament. If these multiple activist affects were different kinds of pre accelerations toward each other and acting with and against each other in an ecology (or networked map) of activism making, how might we consider affect as an event occurring between these objects in time differently by removing the binary of human and nonhuman, of animate and inanimate? The possibilities go beyond Deleuze\u2019s articulation of an immanence that is a plane, that is complete in itself, that is not based upon pre existing objects or subjects, and for which there is no beginning and no end. In our second example, we take up the possibility of queer immanence \u201cversus\u201d Barad\u2019s articulation of transcendence, both using the genderless hair style known as the \u201cqueer fade,\u201d by way of affective personal narrative. THE QUEER FADE When people are \u201cmisgendered\u201d these days it is some misreading of the alchemical combination of gender performance and thingness. Part of trans*2 un/intelligibility comes from the incomprehensible juxtaposition of thingness and performance that defies socialized ways of \u201cthinging\u201d and performing gender. Trans* subjects often \u201cpass\u201d until they smile or laugh or talk\u2014these are the more difficult performances of transition than shifting the thingness of breasts Jaw, or hair. For example, what is the difference in thingness between a butch dyke and a trans* or genderqueer subject? Intentionality, sure, and self definition. But there\u2019s more: how is the materiality of the genderqueer body changing in its performance and sliding around and along that spectrum of un/intelligibility? We offer the following narrative which positions hair as a genderqueer object with its own agency and its own life, perhaps even its own identity that \u201cframes\u201d its human host and informs human observers. *** I recently went to get my hair cut in Melbourne and to my delight found that my new barber knew how to cut my hair. The barber\u2014Rhea\u2014was recommended to me by a dyke friend who has trouble finding an appropriate hair cutter. That might make you laugh, considering what makes an \u201cappropriate\u201d hair cutter for gay, lesbian or trans* people. I honestly never thought about it much. What I did think about was how much money I waste going to new cuttters hoping to find someone who will one day understand my queer head and my request for a \u201cshort back and sides\u201d in a way that somehow\u2014inexplicably\u2014might fit this head. My head. I don\u2019t know why the hairdressers I\u2019ve known have never worked out for me. \u201cWell because you\u2019ve gone to hairdressers, for a start,\u201d Rhea said to me. \u201cI\u2019ve gone to queer hairdressers though,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same,\u201d Rhea said. \u201cYou need a barber. A queer barber.\u201d It got me thinking. Zhe3 explained to me that first of all, hairdressers are different than barbers, and almost never is a hairdresser going to be appropriate for a masculine person. I am a masculine person. I\u2019m a masculine person who wants to look masculine but not scare people off the street (which made hir laugh) and every time I get anything even approaching what I would call a masculine hair cut, it is so harsh that it gives the wrong impression. I don\u2019t want to appear threatening or military, I just want short hair. Sometimes when I get the \u201cshort back and sides\u201d I ask for, my colleagues go, \u201cOh wow, you really went for it hey!?\u201d Or: \u201cThat\u2019s brave!\u201d In this world, you can supposedly now be trans* or even at times nonbinary, as long as it\u2019s not \u201cscary.\u201d Read: other. Scaiy is never good, and as all people of color know, no matter how unfounded it is, or rather how founded in bias. Normative society has its own ideas about what is scary, even when one is trying to just be one\u2019s self. If majoritarian folks become uncomfortable, it all start to go downhill and we\u2019re back to the aggressive transman or brown person ruining everyone\u2019s day. Secondly, zhe explained to me that even some barbers are also not right because they can only see heads as male or female, and although what I possibly want would be considered a male cut, most barbers somehow have an internal resistance to cutting a female head in a male way. Or cutting a female head at all, for that matter. So, they are kind of like doctors with a Hippocratic oath; that is, they will do no harm and because (in their eyes) to cut a female like a male is doing (her) harm, they simply cannot bring themselves to do it. But thirdly, zhe explained to me, even when some female identifying people go to \u201cbarber\u201d school and learn how to cut hair in perhaps a more (trans ) gendered/friendly way, they are often not welcome in traditional barber shops, which are decidedly male spaces. That is why zhe opened her barbershop because there is both a need for non gendered barbering skills, and there is also a need for safe spaces for queer barbers, and queer barBEES (that is, those of us who want a queer haircut). The barbershop had become something of a drop in centers for queers looking for sanctuary. There was a nail section, where mostly M2Fs4 came for getting their nails done, although Rhea admitted she now gets her eyebrows done but draws the line at nails. There is a hair coloring section (perhaps surprisingly the most diversely gendered, sexualized, and intergenerational part of the shop), there is a tattoo section, and then there are her chairs. The shop is filled with retro furniture and graffiti\u2019d walls. It is small and intimate. It is right across the street from the only queer bookshop in town. Zhe said they hired a male identifying barber at the shop once but he just couldn\u2019t cope with the spectrum so they had to let him go. That was a few years ago. Last month, zhe hired a \u201cmale identifying person on the spectrum,\u201d and that seems to be going much better. She said mostly what they struggle with are the pronouns, but he\u2019s doing well, so. Everyone is comfortable. Comfort is the barometer. Is comfort an affect? Is comfort the affect of a queer barbershop in this generation (hint: it was not in the 1990s; in the 1990s it was more like rage)? Of queer sanctuary? Of good queer hair? Where can genderqueer hair thrive? *** Rhea is English and was trained to cut hair in England but has lived in Australia for over ten years, like me. Zhe despairs at the resistant gendering of haircutting, which zhe considers worse here than back home. I described the hair that I wanted, and zhe told me immediately it has a name: \u201cIt\u2019s called a Queer Fade.\u201d \u201cOh, it is?\u201d \u201cOh hell yeah. It\u2019s very popular.\u201d Great, I said, thinking \u201cit can\u2019t be this easy after like decades of being misunderstood\u201d (this is another problem queers encounter: sympathy suspicion\u2014we are so used to being misunderstood that we can\u2019t hardly believe it when we are, so it sometimes leads to confusion or conflict, but not today). Rhea went on: \u201cLook, it\u2019s like I told you: nonbinaiy people want a barber to approach their head like a canvas. It is blank. It can be anything you want it to be. Not make any assumptions about what certain genders\u2014even transgenders\u2014usually do or want. People want to walk in here and say \u201ccut it like a female cut today\u201d or \u201cbuzz it like an army cut\u201d but still expect me to take into account their female features of body characteristics, or things like that. So for example you want a fade haircut, but I can\u2019t cut your hair like a 100 pound twenty year old, because that would look ridiculous, and I can\u2019t cut it even like a straight presenting male army sergeant because then....\u201d Yes well then what? I contemplate looking like a male army sergeant which sounds kind of fabulous. \u201cBut what if I don\u2019t care how I look?\u201d I ask hir. \u201cWell,\u201d said Rhea, \u201ceveryone pretty much cares how they look. It\u2019s just that some people don\u2019t care if they offend others by how they look. Or some people enjoy to offend or shock others. So, there\u2019s a spectrum with that too.\u201d A shock spectrum. How wonderful. As I sat on the stool getting my queer fade, I started to think about the ways in which everything, everything is gendered, and read through gender. And yes, I could think about that in terms of Butler and gender performativity and indeed it is a repetition of acts, certainly it is. But also, I started to think about the gendering of objects. And those languages in which everything has a gendered article, and how in English we think that\u2019s so weird and sometimes we say it\u2019s old fashioned or confining or I don\u2019t know what but you know we do the same thing. And it\u2019s not just that pink stuff is for girls and blue stuff is for boys and if I\u2019m nonbinaiy then do I have to wear yellow forever and oh god I look so bad in yellow. It\u2019s worse than that. I loved how the barber took my head and my face and my body as a canvas, yes, but also an artwork. Zhe put all these elements together as zhe was working: My jaw is not so straight as it once was, and my face is rounder. Even my hair has a different texture now, and my body too is less muscular. The queer fade, zhe explained, is about putting all of those elements together to create a picture, an impression. One picture can be short but masculine. One can be hard and leave me still looking like a woman. One pet peeve of mine is that most hair cutters if I can even get them to cut my hair in a \u201cmasculine\u201d way then go sort of overboard, and they always somehow cut the back of my hair in a straight line across the back. I hate that. It looks boxy and harsh and inelegant and just because I am masculine presenting doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t appreciate elegance. The taper into the back of a neck is such a sensual and tender and sexy part of a person, one that I\u2019ve always loved, and I hate to think of my poor taper being boxed off\u2014it feels violent and disrespectful. I sat and watched Rhea buzz and snip, snip, snip and I heard a small gentle masculine sigh escape my hair that day, a sigh of relief at the touch of a barber who saw it, felt its queemess, understood its individuality. Finessed its masculine want. After Rhea finished, I slid my familiar sunglasses back on and took in my appearance. There was a look that was different, certainly, than my poor hair on those days after another shitty heteronormative buzz in a regular salon. But there was also a way in which I felt that my hair had found itself, was sitting up a little straighter (no pun intended), was more itself than it had been for some time, or ever. \u201cIt\u2019s happy, your hair,\u201d Rhea said with a smile. \u201cIt feels.\u201d It does feel, I thought. \u201cA masculine cut on a trans* person is particular. On you. It\u2019s a particular cut. It\u2019s different.\u201d I agree. I feel sad for all the years that my hair was mauled by someone who didn\u2019t understand this, us, in this moment. Like I felt sorry for my childhood self who had to wear dresses, once I realized that my resistance was a viable thing. The queer fade is a cool cut, but its more than that. The queer fade is a haircut on the spectrum, a gathering in the hair itself. It\u2019s the hair being seen, being felt, honored. Becoming intelligible to the rest of my body, and to other bodies. Genderfluids and genderqueers and those of us non binaries talk about barbers. Somehow barber is queer, hairdresser is not. Hairdresser was like so 90s for fags and drag queens but now barber is my neutral not neutral home away from home. But if hair has its own life, its own journey, and Rhea and my queer fade were both an event for my human person, while at the same time an event for the living object of my hair, then the queer fade is an intra action, an example of Barad\u2019s agential realism while at the same time queering the notion. It is both binary and non binary, both queer and in the being seen/done by Rhea it is, finally, not queer at all. It is \u201cnormal,\u201d for lack of a better word. THE LIFE CYCLE OF (A) HAIR There is a large and dynamic body of scholarly and popular literature about hair and its many performative lives, particularly in African American culture. Queer hair has not been addressed as thoroughly. But there is also such a thing as \u201chair science,\u201d in which we can learn about the object life cycle of hair (its thingness). All hair, not just queer hair. Hair has its own stages, needs, wants, normativities. Hair loss, hair thinning, and hair problems abound. For F2Ms, hair thinning and baldness may come from taking male hormones after a lifetime as a \u201cwoman\u201d with no relationship to the idea of hair loss at all. Hair shock. Hair reconceptualization, as part of the trans* journey. I have enjoyed learning that the life cycle of hair has three phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Each hair has an average life cycle of two to seven years\u2014that is, much less than an average human lifespan. So, we can say, in the first instance, that the life cycle of hair is different and distinct from the life cycle of its human carrier. Which in itself is a kind of agental autonomy. Each day, most people lose fifty to eighty hair strands, and each hair follicle produces a new hair which grows to maturity before falling out. So that is, each hair follicle has its own life span, which is also distinct from the human carrier, and from the hair strands that emerge out of the follicle. Indeed, each strand of hair has its own life cycle which is independent of all other hair strands on that head. How remarkable. The period of active hair growth is called the anagen phase. It lasts from one to three or four years. Hair grows approximately 1 centimeter per month. The second phase is called the catagen phase or transitional phase, which lasts two to three weeks. This is the end of the hair fiber production cycle, when the follicle retracts from the surface of the scalp. The hair stops growing, and remains in this phase for a few weeks before moving into the resting phase, or telogen phase. Who knew hair has a resting phase? It makes sense, all that growing, it\u2019s hard work. In this resting phase, the hair is no longer growing, but is still attached for approximately three months, after which it starts to fall out when brushed or washed or when the human carrier is pulling their hair out after another trans or homophobic encounter. After the hair falls out, a new strand begins to form in the follicle, a cycle that is repeated twenty five to thirty times throughout the life cycle of the human carrier. This individual cycling of the hair growth and loss makes sense: if all the hairs on our heads grew at the same time, in synchronicity, we would go through bushy periods and bald periods. The staggered nature of the hair life cycle offers yet another example of the power of individuation and difference, an animate object lesson the value of which human subjects seem still to misunderstand. While hair doesn\u2019t continue growing after death (despite the urban legend), there are many ways in which hair demonstrates its agency and autonomy in non normative or queer ways. Alopecia for example is a hair loss disease which while understood as an auto immune condition (like rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes) has no known cause, or cure\u2014it is a condition we might talk about as queering the hairy body. Spots of baldness on the head but also elsewhere on the body, alopecia has a particularly public quality about it. That is, like queemess in heteronormative culture, alopecia cannot kill you but it can threaten your wellbeing through depression, social ostracization, and lowering of self esteem. The queer life of hair is autonomous in numerous ways including its object ability to impact on the human subject. Its lives are connected to the human subject, but independent of it. Its own life cycle, character, and even absence are expressions of its autonomous agency and public performativity. THE QUEERNESS OF SILENCE IN ACTIVISM Hair, haircuts, bridges. The affect of activism, the banality of terrorism, and the object relations of the everyday. How do these \u201cobject lives\u201d inform the human subjects which they impact, or indeed and perhaps more importantly how do they ignore, supersede, or wilfully abandon us? Is it possible to think productively about the affect of these objects as an intra active collaboration between the work \u201cdone\u201d by humans and things? In that collaboration, attention to the spaces, the silences and the not yets are important activators. Performance studies and social movement theory have contributed to complex understandings of \u201cperforming rage\u201d or the performance of anger. Yet what of the silence of the bridge in our earlier example, the Westminster activist bridge, or Emma Gonzalez\u2019s silence (Holman Jones & Harris 2018)? Might there be affective and activist lessons there for how affect is passed not only between multiple humans, but also between human and non human? Unlike language, the carrier of meaning between humans, \u201cversus\u201d the material, might silence be the carrier of affect between species? Anthony Giddens has called the separation between object and subject \u201contological security\u201d (1991) a notion that Barad has untangled through her now well known notion of \u201cagential cut,\u201d a concept for describing the \u201capparatus of observation,\u201d in which the subject object are recognized as separate and therefore able to interact with one another (see also the discussion of intraaction in terms of the archive in chapter 2 and queer object time in chapter 3). For her, the material body that has predominated as a focus of feminist research, is always separate from and in relation to practice. Researchers can only reach a kind of reality that is not objective (\u201cthings in themselves\u201d or \u201cthings behind phenomena\u201d) but rather as \u2018\u201cthings\u2019 in phenomena\u201d (Barad 2003, p. 817), a subjectivity that is performed and fluid rather than static (you can hear Butler in this work). She has made the point that laboratory (and other) research is investigated through humanist eyes: our so called empirical evidence is evidence always already as it relates to us. Barad suggests that things do not yet effectively exist outside of human observation or \u201cexperimental arrangements\u201d (2003, p. 822) or as she puts it: \u201cmatter is instances in its intra active becomings\u2014not a thing but a doing, a congealing of agency... matter refers to the materiality/materializa tion of phenomena, not to an inherent fixed property of abstract independently existing objects\u201d (2003, p. 822). In this book, we argue that things\u2014whether observed or not by human researchers/collaborators/intra actors\u2014are their own affectively queer performances. We leave you with these multiple theorists\u2019 arguments for the ways in which objects are already agentic (or agential) without and beyond their \u201csticky attachments\u201d to humans, other animals and objects (Ahmed 2004). For now, we hope we can agree that things have lives that, whether it seems queer to us or not, are dynamic, observable and often entirely independent from human influence. CRITICAL QUEER ASSEMBLAGES Mobility is a foundational element of queer life, queer ideas and concepts as well as of queer scholarship. As such, queer mobilities\u2014literally and conceptually\u2014characterize modernity (capitalist, terrorist and activist) and its academic interpretations. Queer epistemologies, for example, often emerge out of popular events while also being critically distant from them, both in and out, both subject and object, activist and acted upon. Hetero normative reactions to queer mobilities as well as the marking of migrants, refugees, vagrants, and travelers as perverse and dangerous, have been constant drivers of social change and its scholarly analysis, a condition of modernity that is only accelerating through digitally inflected online/offline worlds/encounters. Queer theories, affects, activisms, and objects can be understood as co constitutive in response to the rise of nationalist and con servative religious ideologies, accelerating global warming and expanding global markets. The intertwined dynamics of queer mobilities have critically changed the ways in which we consider and advocate for human and morethanhuman subjects as urgently and affectively interconnected as well as queerly interdependent. With an explosion of queer from concepts, scholarship, disciplines, mobilities, technologies, geopolitical migrations, onto epistemological sites of labor, and global intimacies, we are thinking queerly with and through things that affectively spin us into entanglements that ask us work responsively to the worldings around and in us. By decentering the human in queer and affect theory, we respond to Chen and Luciano\u2019s (2015) call to treat \u201cthe human\u201d as simply one of many elements in a queer critical assemblage, as well as understand critical storytelling practices as inherently queer practices in times of terror (Harris & Holman Jones 2017). We have explored some ways of investigating the complex relations between queemess, objects, and \u201caffect\u201d as they emerge in the shifting geopolitical landscape of contemporary terrorist/ capitalist culture, and its analysis and activism by queer agents (both human and more than human), as a door opening invitation to chapter 2 and the rest of the book.

Chapter Two Queering the Archive THE ARCHIVE\u2014DIGITAL AND OTHERWISE In this chapter, we consider the ways in which things/artefacts/objects increasingly and collectively constitute an archive. This era\u2014the first quarter of the twenty first century\u2014is typified through digital technology as an era of \u201cthe archive,\u201d and characterized largely in response to the ways in which that archive demands to be curated (by humans racing to keep up). At the same time, the agency of the digital archive threatens to overwhelm the increasing anachronism and precarity of the non digital archive. What cannot be algorithmically searched, parsed, and curated increasingly does not exist. Though as Kathryn Ricketts writes, \u201cIf I am a museum of my own lived experiences, what are my artifacts?\u201d (Ricketts 2011, p. 4). In this chapter, we argue that this process of re/making as \u201cdigitally intelligible\u201d is a kind of queering of the archive of human and nonhuman experience; a presumptive sign of \u201cprogress\u201d which leaves in its wake the ephemera of narrowing relevance and ballooning obsolescence, a threat to not only the material world but to thought worldings, relational practices and the notion of sustainability itself. What matters\u2014and consequently what is perceived to be worthy of \u201ckeeping\u201d\u2014is coming to be more and more narrowly defined. For example, at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam, a clever interweaving of his classic and other contemporary digital works hangs in the foyer, pointing toward ways in which Van Gogh\u2019s work remains contemporary but also suggests future directions for visual art and non/representation. The many Van Gogh inspired selfies in this exhibition space provoke us to consider Van Gogh\u2019s numerous early self portraits as not just expedient due to his poverty (never sufficient funds for models), but also an iterative search for self representation, potentially an endless loop of creative autoethnography, and a signal of the impossibility of any fixed notion of self representation, differently embodied in the nineteenth century and now. That is, the archive may look different, but the human, posthuman, and creative impulse to accumulate, store and re/cover \u201chistorical knowledge and forms of remembrance\u201d is persistent and familiar (Merewether 2006, p. 10). The growing field of critical consumer studies attests to the need for more reflective approaches to user experience and archiving, and brings attention to the ethics of accumulation. The ability to accumulate things\u2014images, commentary, histories, opinions, perspectives, communities and voices\u2014 demands a change in our relationship with knowledge and the politics that drive and shape such knowledges. Where Foucault\u2019s (1969/1992) \u201carchaeologist of knowledge\u201d aimed to learn about and re/cover and re/construct our knowledge about the past by culling and sifting material remains was never interested in knowing stuff or accumulating knowledge as a monolithic entity but rather in re/covering an re/constructing knowledge of the past by sifting through material remains, an important shift has perhaps occurred in popular culture. Contemporary archivists have moved their attention away from understanding knowledge or facts, toward making them, or what some in hybrid social movement theory, DIY, and digital cultures research formulate as curating them. Such teleological shifts trouble questions about expertness, user experience, and prosumer cultures. Some posthumanists, new materialists, and artificial intelligence scholars wonder about the impact of the possibility that increasingly the best experts of knowledge accumulation and interpretation are machine and/or nonhuman. Research contexts and relationships have also been deeply impacted by this shift in thinking. Recent innovations in how we look at data, especially in more agentic ways, nudge researchers toward ever dynamic, multi directional and interactive relationships with the data we formerly may have thought of as \u201cours.\u201d Today, data is increasingly framed as \u201chaving a life,\u201d even while the dehumanization of organically human subjects deteriorates through environmental displacement, religious and other conflict. Yet data can also be vibrant, big, or \u201cbroken\u201d (Pink et al. 2016). This suggests new ways of thinking about life as having/being data. A recurring question in this book is the distance/difference between transactional or utilitarian approaches to research, and to artistic, aesthetic, or creative practices with and through things. We find the self conscious and sometimes oppressive need to intervene in everyday practices in order to make them \u201cdata\u201d to be harmful, colonial, and imperialist. We wonder what data might show us about humanizing creative practice and our affective and intimate relationships with things. To begin, we draw on the popular and well known example of two paintings by Vincent Van Gogh as material manifestations of the commonalities of both data and art, relationship and knowledge. While Van Gogh and his work have been the subject (and object) of countless artistic and analytic queer treatments, many focus on his troubled and inconclusive intimate life. Here we turn to Van Gogh\u2019s body of work, as a material body or archive which stands as a trace of the intra active event of his life as performance. It is a body of work that remains vibrantly indeterminate and defiantly unintelligible. VAN GOGH AND HIS ARCHIVE The intense and problematic relationship between Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, most particularly their last parting, offers an example of an aesthetic and affective event which might be seen best through the paintings which both anticipated and remain from that encounter, rather than the narratives that are so often drawn upon. In late December 1888, merely two months into their 1888 house sharing arrangement in Arles, Gaugin left in a rage. Van Gogh entered his last, protracted, and relentless spiral downward into his eventual mental breakdown and death eighteen months later, on July 29, 1890. According to Van Gogh, they fought and Gaugin left, and in despair Van Gogh went walking, cut off his ear, then brought it to a local sex worker. However, other accounts suggest that perhaps Gaugin himself cut his friend\u2019s ear off, a fact which Van Gogh may have hidden. Either way, there is no real or exact evidence of events based on narrative accounts. Still, such \u201chistorical\u201d accounts continue to drive or frame our understandings of events, even in the postmodern recognition that narratives are subjective, incomplete and told by those with a vested interest in portraying the events in power drenched if not self congratulatory terms. And, in relation to these stories, what do material objects have to say about the archive or the unfolding of an event or sequence of events? Art historian Charles Merewether wonders whether what is \u201cmaterially present, visible or legible\u201d might be \u201cadequate to an event that has passed out of present time\u201d (p. 12). The relation between an artifact and an archive is that of a residual trace or traces which \u201ccontain the potential to fragment and destabilize either remembrance as recorded, or history as written as sufficient means for providing the last word in the account of what has come to pass\u201d (Merewether 2006, p. 10). Looking to the archive for traces of \u201cwhat has come to pass\u201d belies our obsession with what Walter Benjamin (Benjamin & Underwood 1936/2008) called the aura and the totemic value of artefacts that outlive their original contexts. Gauguin's Chair In November 2017, we visit the Van Gogh museum on a blustery day as part of our first trip to Amsterdam. We linger before these two chairs in conver sation, this pair, this companionable duality that eluded Van Gogh in \u201creal\u201d life some 130 years before. In anticipation of the Gaugin\u2019s visit to Arles in October 1888, Van Gogh painted hopeful and exuberant sunflower canvases to decorate the house. He painted the chairs in November while they were together. Instead of painting portraits, straightforward renderings of himself and his idol, Van Gogh painted chairs, two symbolic portraits that contained all the ephemera and all the timeless symbolisms of the two men. They were, in a sense, in the tradition of the vanitas paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries from the Netherlands. They subtly showed both the vibrancy and decay of both men and their oeuvres. Van Gogh painted them as companion portraits, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Armchair,\u201d and his own \u201ccompanion painting,\u201d \u201cVincent\u2019s Chair with His Pipe.\u201d Gauguin\u2019s chair conveys a sense of shadow; deep, earthy reds, greens, and browns punctuated by bright yellow and blue; and two candles glowing and modem French novels on the seat of the chair\u2014a nod to Gauguin\u2019s imagination and use of dream imagery. The walls in the Arles cottage were white but Vincent painted them a deep green as a tribute to \u201cmystery and the night\u201d (\u201cGaugin\u2019s Chair\u201d 2018). Gauguin\u2019s visit was a big moment for Van Gogh as an artist, and Van Gogh was never easy in the company of his fellow artists, seeking and often failing at friendship and collaborative community. He had been inviting friends, artists, and colleagues from his time in Paris to come stay at Arles, to help him establish it as an artists\u2019 colony, and it was slow going, perhaps owing to his frequent quarrels with friends and family members. In the lead up to his mentor Gauguin\u2019s arrival, Van Gogh painted more than 200 works, including the more famous \u201cSunflowers\u201d and fruit trees. But it is Van Gogh\u2019s chair, and not Gauguin\u2019s that draws my attention. I\u2019m pulled in by its everydayness. Its movement. Van Gogh\u2019s brushstrokes somehow both materializing the liveness of that beautiful (perfect?) anticipation of his mentor and friend and their coming together gone wrong, all at once. Van Gogh's Chair Van Gogh\u2019s own portrait was in bright yellow and blue, on the seat lay a simple clay pipe with tobacco and crumpled piece of paper, both humble things of the earth. Of the two Vincent\u2019s chair is the more rustic, made of cheaper wood, symbolic of his view that Gauguin was more sophisticated, worldly and successful. Van Gogh had technique, but Gauguin was considered a master of the conceptual. Which is more fully an ontological project, that which repositions humans outside of the means of making knowledge, of understanding and being? Or that which positions us as part of the workings of knowing, understanding and being, as enfolded into its very performance? Perhaps Vincent\u2019s pain can be considered the ontological center of meaning making in creative intra action rather than the workings of an individual human mind (or talent), so deeply confused, seeking to \u201crepresent\u201d meaning, being painted into sense for outside others. Perhaps, too, the chairs taken together, the companions they were meant to be, teach us about our desires to know and the show the world in all its dynamism and indeterminacy. How can inanimate things be companions? What does art know about affect that humans do not? We wander along shadowy cold November (2017) Amsterdam streets exploring these quandaries and considering how disappointed Gauguin must have been to finally acquiesce and go to Arles with the promise of heat, burning sunsets, and companionship, only to find a cold, windy, and unfriendly place. We duck into a warm cafe near the canal and watch the light fade; rain begins to fall. We debate whether the impressionist movement itself, or more accurately, impressionism as a practice that seeks to make impressions rather than \u201caccurate\u201d representations, is a doing of affect theory. ART AFFECTS (ARTIFACTS) AS RELATIONSHIP; THE MATERIAL(IST) PROXY We discuss the chairs (and the men) over dinner. We weep at Vincent\u2019s suffering. He remains an enigma and we are not convinced or satisfied by the elliptical commentary on our headsets, limited as it is to dates and times and so called historical \u201cfacts.\u201d Even while the historical narrative mains partial, and subjective, it claims to something more: the paintings tell a story that feels more complete, if less comprehensible. Narrative fails, but the chairs are resilient. We say Van Gogh was concerned with the \u201ctheory\u201d (or technique) of painting more than the content. His obsession was with brushstrokes and light; we compare this to formal versus theoretical innovation in our own worlds of scholarship. We debate the impossibility of Gauguin \u201cversus\u201d Van Gogh as the dreamlike versus the real, the qualitative versus quantitative, the mathematics of painting. Of the persistent and immature binary imperative of any us versus them. Van Gogh was committed to the \u201creal\u201d conditions and precar ity of his first subjects, yet equally committed to the burgeoning Impressionist and modernist movements, wishing create the mood and the resonance of \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d rather than any \u201crealist\u201d portrait. Gauguin, by contrast, was concerned with content, yet believed that the form was an imaginative rather than a space for \u201crendering\u201d anything real. Gauguin sought to represent the dream life, the abstract. He encouraged Van Gogh (and others) to paint from memory in order to stimulate the imagination. Vincent and Paul fought over this. We wonder (and disagree) at dinner whether this could be likened to scholars who are differently interested in or focused on theoretical or formal experimentation (the theorists, the philosophers) versus those who are primarily concerned with \u201capplied\u201d research, that is the content, relationship, and mode. In this formulation, we decide that Van Gogh would be an affect scholar, and Gauguin a methodologist. There are myriad analyzes of the chairs and their symbolism as both representing the two men as well as psychoanalytic considerations of Van Gogh\u2019s homoerotic attraction for Gauguin as well as his less symbolic differentiation between them along class lines. Rather than these tacts (or tactics), here we are interested in Van Gogh and his intra action with a number of objects and beings: the chairs, the house, the ear, Gauguin, his brother Theo, the prostitute and the hospital. The links provide a breadcrumb trail that resists analysis and affectually queers the archive. They co constitute an archive that, in its collectivity, tells other stories in remnants and material traces. No words, only traces. We reject the meta narrative of Vincent as mad, and his brother Theo as \u201ctogether.\u201d We appreciate and notice their interdependence (whether noted by art historians or not), noting that Theo died so soon (six months) after the loss of Vincent. We note the juxtaposition of Theo dying of an STD while Vincent remains \u201cchaste\u201d in the literature. We recognize them as two sides of the same material and spiritual and practice led body. We recognize the inability of Vincent to offer his ear (his vulnerability) to Gauguin, or his brother, or any intimate other\u2014he cut it in a field, and offered it to a stranger. In grief and despair, Van Gogh was still offering others objects, material manifestations of a desire for what? Recognition? Connection? Differentiation? Care? Whatever his desires, each and all of his attempts fail to cement any effective emotional tie to follow. In their solidity, perhaps Van Gogh was hoping to find a queering of the emotional unmooring that he was feeling: Perhaps Gauguin should have worried about what his friend was feeling when he portrayed both of them like this\u2014gone, vanished, leaving only their old familiar chairs. After all, Van Gogh, who loved English graphic art, got the idea from an obituary image. At Christmas 1870 the Victorian magazine the Graphic published a valediction for an absent fixture of Christmas past: Charles Dickens had died that year, and Luke Fildes\u2019[s] illustration The Empty Chair, Gad\u2019s Hill\u2014Ninth of June 1870 depicts Dickens\u2019s chair at his desk, pulled back, but empty, no one there to write that year\u2019s Christmas story....Van Gogh smoked a pipe because Dickens advised it as a cure for melancholy. His pipe lies abandoned here. (Jones 2004) Yet objects can be lives and worlds in and of themselves of course, not just as symbols of human lives lost, lived or emergent. Gaston Bachelard\u2019s famous Poetics of Space (1964/1994) leads us to consider the house as body. The need for (or illusion of) refuge, a basic need for most animals, is evoked by the functional but also symbolic power of the house or home, but also of such affective objects as Van Gogh\u2019s paintings from late 1888 at Arles. THE POSTHUMAN POWER OF THE PAINTING RETURN In one of Van Gogh\u2019s most famous Arles paintings, Sunflowers, the flowers are dying. For the two of us wandering in the Van Gogh museum on this rainy day, it\u2019s a self told tale of sunflowers, by the sunflowers. An autoethnography of sunflowers. We feel their insistence of their own truth, not an artist\u2019s depiction of an idealized bouquet for the enjoyment of others, but this is a fantasy, isn\u2019t it? The paintings are painted by Van Gogh\u2019s hand, painted for himself perhaps, and an audience of other non sunflowers. Still, we love it because there is truth in self telling, self representation, even when it is mediated, as by Van Gogh. Simple, radiant, heavy flowers, all facing different directions. There\u2019s a feeling of power in their heavy heads. The sunflowers, the house, and Gauguin, were all a part of Van Gogh\u2019s vision of building an artists\u2019 community in the house at Arles, a place where he might finally belong, a place of his making, his belonging, an alternative space\u2014a gift, he might have thought\u2014and yet, no one wanted his gift. Later, he offered his ear but that gift too was unwanted. To have Gaugin come, finally, after so much cajoling, and indeed only once Vincent\u2019s brother Theo agreed to pay a monthly stipend to the destitute Gauguin, and him staying so briefly, was worse than perhaps not coming at all. In the end, all Van Gogh had was an empty house. Two empty chairs. And the sunflowers. He painted five versions of \u201cThe Sunflowers\u201d between August and September of 1888, all full of dazzling light. He preferred the dying, the rundown, the rustic, because he said it was, to him, more true to life. We vibrate with Vincent in these identifications of life in death, light in shadow, beauty in the rustic, the broken down, belonging in the abject. These are not vibrant sunflowers in full bloom, but they are sunflowers demanding to be heard and seen in their dying light. We are moved by their vulnerability, their humility, their truth in decay. We are held fast by these sunflowers in a busy gallery space with humans moving quickly past, buzzing, a word here or there. We find a posthuman insistence here, a refusal to move on as Van Gogh and other humans have (inevitably) had to do. The paintings remain in ways that we cannot. We are comforted by their heavy materiality and resilience. We rejoice in the cross breeding between paint and human and the hybrid beings like sunflowers that can come of these border crossings. In May 1889, after his bad time with the ear, Van Gogh entered the asylum at Saint Remy, not far from Arles. In that single year before he died, he created approximately 142 works. One of them was The Irises in May 1889, while still in the asylum. This painting is bright blue on a yellow contrasting background and also some of the dying flowers are falling over (he did two distinct versions, but only the one at the museum in Amsterdam has the dying flowers, the other is more cheerful). Needless to say, he preferred the irises in their decline. It is one of his most famous works, and in 1987 (temporarily) became the most expensive painting ever sold, going for $54 million (Reif 1987). This painting life, this commodity life, is inextricably tied to Vincent\u2019s and yet is independent as well. Its vibrancy is often overshadowed by Van Gogh\u2019s biography, his timeline, his mental and emotional life narrative. The materiality of the work\u2014like the chairs, and the sunflowers\u2014struggles to be encountered in its own time, taken on its own merits, even in this so called postmodern moment in which the author is no longer foregrounded in considerations of works of art. Even the totemic value, the aura of the work, is not its primary calling card in popular contexts and conversations but rather its place in relation to Van Gogh. And like all family members, surely The Irises has its own identity, its independent agency, its queer life apart from it co creator, its maker, its material parent Vincent. Yet Vincent\u2019s relationship with the environment, as opposed to the consistently disappointing human race, is also evident in the trend of subject in his final works. His focus near the end, in such paintings as Wheat Field with Reaper (September 1889) as well as Almond Blossom (Feb 1890), is increasingly tied to the sky. No longer intent on peasant faces or human life in literal ways at all (as he began), he goes back to his love of nature, his comfort in beauty and the outdoors, a place of belonging. Tree Roots (late July 1890), Wheat Fields with Crows (July 1890) and others during this last period take the viewer back into the earth. Vincent\u2019s more than human orientations and sources of comfort document not just ways of seeing and encountering, but also of core relationships between the human and nonhuman, our deep need of the nonhuman, and the endlessly unconditional belonging and renewal to be found there. The wheat fields in which Vincent spent so much of his final months painting, and in which he eventually shot himself, might have their own ways of holding and re/telling what Van Gogh brought to them. Images of these works are now in the public domain, given the length of time since the artist\u2019s death. We review them online after our intimate encounter with so many of them at the Amsterdam museum, and compare the disembodied experience with the proximate one. So much is lost. And why, we wonder, is the agency of these representations taken (or given) in relation to their human maker still? At a time when the \u201cpersonhood\u201d of an increasing range of sea animals and natural environments are being recognized and protected by the United Nations and other international rights\u2019 bodies, we wonder at the rights of these images (if not their expensive material bodies) to be circulated without their permission. Artworks like these might play their own role in digital and disembodied posthuman agency, and the queering of nonhuman rights. If, for example, such works\u2019 original incarnations can sell for tens of millions of dollars, and yet their digital reproductions can be circulated and \u201cused\u201d without permission, how does that alter the relationship between iterations of Wheat Fields with Crows, for example, if not between the works and Vincent himself? Here, in the pages of this manuscript, itself a digital and material work, Van Gough\u2019s paintings have created yet other image bodies and relationships\u2014in this case, Michael Crowhurst\u2019s painting A Dog/Cat Thing with Fishes, a material and virtual response to Van Gough\u2019s chairs, our account of encountering those chairs, and the conversations the collision of those images and ideas sponsored. In each iteration, digital works are altering material works in ways that queer the category of relationship between virtual/material more generally. We read Van Gogh\u2019s preoccupation with form to be a corollary of the evolution of his content, in the same way that theory and practice work together and mutually inform one another in scholarly work. Van Gogh started with portraits of peasants; when he moved to Paris, he began to experiment with color, composition, and brushstroke in still lifes mostly concerned with beauty and affect, and near the end of his life created increasingly abstract renderings of nature that evoke emotional states more than reach for symbolic representations. The vast majority of the (seemingly endless) curatorial commentary on Van Gogh and his troubled work and life focuses primarily on the masterful, completely experimental, stylistic aspects of his late works, but neglects to wonder why he becomes increasingly abstract, possibly because despite his extensive body of letters left behind, it remains mostly conjecture. But isn\u2019t the inconclusiveness of conjecture, even (and perhaps most interestingly) when we are faced with indeterminateness and abstraction still a central concern in creative (and theoretical) work? Figure 2.1. A Dog/Cat Thing with Fishes, Michael Crowhurst Image courtesy of Michael Crowhurst. Perhaps Van Gogh\u2019s move toward abstraction reflects a liberation from a psychic or intellectual need for sense making in any traditional sense. We consider whether this creative trajectory can be considered alongside theoretical moves between '\u2018pure theory,\u201d or philosophical inquiry untethered from the demands (or constraints) of the material. Van Gogh\u2019s Wheat Field with Reaper was to him a funny painting, seen through the bars of his \u201ccell\u201d at the hospital where he was confined. The grim reaper, cutting down all of humanity, was \u201calmost smiling\u201d and the painting reified the cycle of nature, no cause for fear or sorrow (despite the dark and tumultuous sky overhead) (\u201cWheatfield with a Reaper\u201d 2018). Yet the green sky followed by the completely abstract and unfinished Tree Roots say so much about drilling down into the essence of nature from which we all come and to which we all return. No sense making required, just an earthly affect. The curatorial commentary on Tree Roots says: A persistent myth has arisen that the more dramatic Wheatfield with Crows is Van Gogh\u2019s last work. However, Tree Roots is the more likely candidate, for he was unable to complete the painting, as is clear to see at the lower left. The virtually unrecognizable forms, powerful lines, and vivid colours have been forwarded to demonstrate that Van Gogh was an important forerunner of abstract art. This is the painting that was propped on his easel when he died. What can be said about the materiality or the queer life of this painting\u2019s position on the easel at the time of the artist\u2019s death? In Van Gogh\u2019s death, the queer life of Tree Roots offered a contrasting narrative about art. As the human body dies, the posthuman body remains; as the painting body more gradually disintegrates, the virtual body remains, perhaps \u201cforever.\u201d Frames of time expand in undulating waves, like Van Gogh\u2019s wheat fields, or rhi zomatically burrow like The Roots. This is just one of the ways in which art and its material practices can inform\u2014not just be changed by, but change\u2014 emergent virtual creative and human attenuated archives. Just over a hundred years later, contemporary Australian artist Patricia Piccinini continues to experiment with human/nonhuman interfaces, and the ways in which these intra actions are co constituting change. Her \u201ctransgenic\u201d sculptures are themselves a kind of archive or sculpture storehouse for the ideas that most concern her: reproduction, representation, and ecological sustainability. TRANSGENICS Piccinini says she finds it surprising when people find her works grotesque, scary, or abhorrent. For her, nature is far more shocking and unsettling than anything like her sculptures. She makes sculptures, photographs, videos, drawings, installations and panel works concerned with themes of fertility, relationships and reproduction, the effects of technology on human experience including biotechnology, and futurism. She creates what she has termed \u201cfuture fables for now,\u201d thus blurring not only geospatial and species delineations but temporal ones as well. There is nostalgia and classicism in her works, while painting future (although never dystopic) scenes in which we are called toward empathy and understanding, rather than fear, isolation, and aversion. Her work problematizes advances in biotechnology and digital technologies as ethical challenges for human nature in an increasingly \u201cartificial\u201d world, highlighting the ways in which the blurring of boundaries between species and ecological actors both decenter human centered culture, pushing humanity to find new ways of enslaving the non human world in our service, and also exploring creative responses to the endangerment of so many species. Haraway considers Piccinini\u2019s work in her treatise on companion species and the ongoing threat of human exceptionalism, noting, \u201cthat \u201cPic cinini knows, living beings knotted in dynamic ecologies are opportunistic, not idealistic, and it is not surprising to find many native species flourishing in both new and old places because of the resources provided by interlopers from other lands and waters\u201d (2008, p. 288). Indeed, Piccinini\u2019s sculptures of human pig hybrid beings have been described as \u201csculptures of life forms that don\u2019t exist\u201d (Heyman 2016), reflecting concern with the proliferation of pigs as subjects for biogenetic testing. Empathy and connection are foregrounded in her work and equally distributed amongst human and non human subjects. In the video accompanying her Brisbane 2018 solo show at the GOMA arts center, Piccinini says, \u201cEven when a character is alone, there\u2019s a relationship. They are part of an ecosystem.\u201d She shows humans interacting with hybrid beings that have both human and animal characteristics, sometimes with an element of the unknown. Her sculpture The Bond features a mother figure holding a young child who is \u201cpart human, part pig and part running shoe\u201d (GOMA 2018). In The Bond, Piccinini explores how people can understand and connect with other beings despite their differences. She anthropomorphizes machines with both animal and human characteristics, famously in her scooter sculpture The Stags (2008) and elsewhere, which also consider the implications of consumer culture. In the GOMA exhibition, the curator\u2019s notes on the sculpture The Struggle (2017) observe: This heightened animal inspired drama has been modelled after the work of eighteenth century Romantic painter George Stubbs, famous for his cycle of \u201cHorse and Lion\u201d subjects. Here, Piccinini replaces the horse with one of her Vespa \u201cdeer.\u201d Piccinini states of this work: \u201cIn a world where the cultural and the natural\u2014the technological and organic\u2014are ever more intermingled, this wilderness is my symbolic representation of a space where technology has become so natural that it takes on a life of its own.\u201d (GOMA 2018) Piccinini's work also explores the implications of technological advancement. The curatorial notes on her \"Embryo 2016\u201d remark on the invocation of spirits of wild animals in the design and promotion of luxury consumer items, especially cars\u2014Jaguar being one of the most obvious\u2014but what if new machines grew animal instincts? In Piccinini\u2019s Embryo, we face the serious notion that artificial intelligence might eventually find a way to closely imitate organic reproduction, growth and development. (GOMA 20IS) The queemess of Piccinini's worldings might just be in their effectiveness to flatten accepted human/animal/machine/environmental hierarchies, a deeply sociopolitical project executed with creative empathy that reaches across genetic, historical and industrial divides. Piccinini has long been inspired by another nineteenth century artwork, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818/2003). Piccinini feels empathy for Dr. Frankenstein's monster, as she does for her own monstrous creations. She has spoken many times about the monster and how confusing she finds it that it's not worthy of love in Shelley's world. She creates human centered and yet more than human creations that vibrate with empathy and pathos. She invites audiences to love and identify with the creations rather than be repulsed. She uses familiar \"humanizing\" characteristics like \"kind eyes\u201d and tender positions and vulnerability, to encourage affective responses to her sculptures. Her works also make room for non human centered worlds, whether they are worlds in which no humans exist, or where new kinds of human other hybrids predominate. In each of these moves, the works ask visitors to consider how nature has its own way of transmogrifying, and that those evolutions\u2014 despite being profoundly affected by human intervention dining the Anthro pocene\u2014are not contingent upon ongoing human existence. Evolution, she seems to suggest, will just keep doing its thing whether \u201cwe\u201d are here, or not. Piccinini helps us imagine new hybrid combinations beyond the rather reductive digital (online/offline) considerations that seem to dominate today\u2019s discourses of queering human and posthuman relationality. Her new worlds, new relationships and \u201cfuture fables for now\u201d are both a warning and a celebration of what may be to come, a queering not only of humanity but of the beautiful and monstrous intersections of human and posthuman in corporeal as well as digital ways. For Piccinini, the evolving human body becomes a queer archive of (mythologized) perfection and purity; she queers the notion of \u201cnormal,\u201d and of species hierarchies, and of the human as the primary holder of love and other affective attachments. This future focus so present in Piccinini\u2019s work underpins Braidotti\u2019s concern with \u201cnot to know who we are,\u201d but \u201cwhat, at last, we want to become\u201d (2002, p. 2). Braidotti attends to both \u201cenfleshed materialism\u201d and \u201cdifference and transformation in nonnegative, non perjorative terms\u201d (Pelletier 2004, p. 202) as evidenced in animal, insect, cyborg and machine bodies. These intersecting queer lives are driven by queer becomings in both discursive and material ways. And while digital reconsiderations of agentic materiality are expanding hybrid ways of being, it is important to remember the dangers of reproducing social codes in online worlds that once promised liberation from offline oppressions. QUEER APERTURES Michael O\u2019Rourke writes that \u201cAll of the orifices of materiality are open to companions. Companions are in company; they accompany each other in their finitude and thickness\u201d (2016, p. xxiii). We are interested in spaces and thickenings that are queer, and that queer other actants (human and definitely otherwise). The interstitial spaces where queer bodies and queer circuits intersect are typified by flows and spaces like the queerly confounding Internet of Things (IoT), a growing network or sensors and archives of thing lives. In this final section, we turn to two more than human flows which we see working transversally across the notion of thing lives and time: the Internet of Things (IoT, including Bruno Latour\u2019s \u201cthe Parliament of Things\u201d), and the philosophy of Object Oriented Ontology (OOO). The IoT, also sometimes known as the internet of objects (IoO), refers to the networked interconnection of everyday objects, and machine to machine communications, or what we refer to as thing lives. The IoT, as a thing, was first articulated in 1999 by Kevin Ashton and refers to any device connected to the web (internet), from personal devices like phones, to superhuge devices like China\u2019s new 93 petaflop Sunway TaihuLight at the National Supercomputing Centre in Wuxi, China, which performs approximately 93,000 trillion calculations per second. Indeed, the vast and diverse network and range of things is rapidly expanding to include all sorts of things that in recent but bygone eras would have been considered household items or electronics even like lightbulbs, as the world moves ever closer to a ubiquitously networked state, most commonly now euphemized as smart homes or smartdties (which in actuality might be better termed \u201csurveillance enabled cities,\u201d homes, cars, and lives). What is an internet enabled environment, and why is it good beyond being able to tell your television set to turn itself off? There is not unanimous agreement about what the IoT is, or what it means for the planetary near future, either for humans or everyone else. One simple way of articulating its character is that of \u201cgiving a network address to a thing and fitting it with sensors\u201d (Bunz & Meikle 2018, p. ii) in order for \u201cthese things [to] gain new skills that are expressed in new forms of communication\u201d (Bunz & Meikle 2018, p. iii). The IoT includes physical things as well as virtual things, things deployed by and for both individuals and corporate/govemment interests. While the IoT rapidly develops and expands, it is creating an archive that has more uses and dangers than previously thought, but also queers time in the archive\u2019s ability to both outlast and out perform human time. Corporatized culture and research/development into artificial intelligence and augmented reality can\u2019t wait to further technologize the living environments of \u201ccivilized society.\u201d We have all read about self driving cars (possibly the most popular focus of \u201csmart technology\u201d at the moment), but corporate and government investment is squarely human centered and the move toward an IoT only reifies humans at the center of an ever faster, evermore networked circuit of service to humans and human productivity. Most literature about the IoT has focused on comparing the \u201cgood\u201d benefits (improving quality of life for humans) versus the \u201cbad\u201d or potentially destructive or alienating qualities of it. Much of the rest of the research in this area focuses on data lives, big data, and data curation due to the ever increasing generation of data through these ever more networked lives. From a human centered point of view, there are concerns about security, where and by whom the data is being used (or will be used in an unknowable future), privacy concerns, and surveillance/tracking/compliance culture. HUMAN OBSOLESCENCE Latour has said that objects are the human race\u2019s co producers.1 Devices like smartphones allow users to connect to billions of other things, all the while recording data, voice, video, audio, motion, location and more through technologies of self tracking (Spicer & Cederstrom 2015). As Samuel Greengard points out, the convergence of rapid advancement in multiple types of immersive and embedded technologies as well as wireless and cloud computing \u201chas introduced the concept of robotic insects and animals, nanobots and microbots that can exist inside humans, and drone fleets that can accomplish tasks in the sky above\u201d (2015, p. xiii). The affordances of both big data and nano data are most often framed as enabling human understandings to surpass anything imagined only a few years ago; yet we are interested in the affordances of these technologies in making human centered and human directed activity obsolete. In this way, the success of human developed technology may, perhaps for the first time, queer ourselves out of existence. This wild new world which allows us to \u201cmake sense of the motion between and among things, including people, animals, vehicles, air currents, viruses\u201d is exhilarating until it becomes terrifying (Greengard 2015, p. xiv). At the same time, the IoT can \u201csupport systems that operate independent of human oversight and, incredibly, get smarter on their own over time by adapting an underlying algorithm\u201d (Greengard 2015, p. xiv). The IoT does represent a revolution, and one which will have far reaching consequences, but it is not the first time humans have been terrified by our own fabulousness or insistence on pushing forward into ethical and moral no persons\u2019 lands for the sake of conquering the unknown. For example, the United States\u2019 government committed to the development of a hydrogen bomb, which was first tested in 1952, a decision that began a global arms race that changed our view of the human race as well as the planet. The so called \u201cDoomsday Clock\u201d was a symbol for how close humanity was to self annihilation, or nuclear destruction \u201cmidnight,\u201d representing the first time that the total destruction of the planet was discussed at both the macro and micro levels. School children were trained in how to brace for a nuclear attack, from the 1950s until well into the 1970s in the United States. Thus, the rapidly expanding agency of things and nonhuman entities is assured. In this text, we are seeking to add to the enquiry into how agency might have things, looking at how humans may continue to have agency in an environment of accelerating obsolescence. If \u201ctoday, to write theory means writing code,\u201d not only objects but coding itself is emerging as the new onto epistemological driver for diversifying forms of knowledge as well as lifeforms. In its agility to replicate, self adjust and adapt to rapidly changing conditions and requirements, coding can explode traditional notions of normativity, including \u201cheteronormativity,\u201d as code can morph to endless choices of queer non essentialism (Galloway & Thacker 2007). Like the internet, accessibility is an issue for the IoT. Legal and cultural theorists have identified a need to address the \u201cdigital divide\u201d at a globe scale, recognizing and accounting for the gap amongst \u201cindividuals, households, businesses and geographic areas at different socio economic levels\u201d (Weber & Weber 2010, p. 103). If the proliferation of data at the personal and global level means that curation and searchability of the archive is emerging as a primary concern, accessibility of both hardware and software will create increasing divides between the networked and the digitally isolated. Though just because the IoT is proliferating by users at the level of billions per year, this proliferation doesn\u2019t mean that old archives of data and things are no longer valuable: Consider the ongoing commercial value of My space. To many, this social media platform is only of historical interest, with its brief prominence in the middle of the first decade of the twenty first century now long eclipsed by larger networks such as Facebook. Yet Myspace continues to change hands for eight figure sums because its decade old archive of user data remains valuable to advertisers\u2014those data prompted Time, Inc. to purchase the owner of Myspace, a company called Viant, in 2016 (Jackson 2016). More than a decade after many users last logged into Myspace, the digital traces they left behind\u2014contacts and connections, likes and dislikes, emotions and opinions\u2014still offer lucrative data. In this context, the future trajectories of the personal health data that users of internet of things tracking technologies share with so many unknowable third parties are at best uneasy. (Bunz & Meikle 2018, p. ii) We consider the IoT\u2014or the Parliament of Things, for Latour\u2014as capacitating things in community, both communicatively and actively, making possibly not only human assistance but also and already to (at least in part) replace humans in many (and only now emerging) ways. Latour\u2019s articulation of a Parliament of Things (1991) has long connected the agency of things, the non duality of nature culture and our own inescapable hybridify as a kind of connectivity. His notion of the \u201cConstitution\u201d2 includes his [self identified] category of \u201cnonmodem,\u201d that is \u201canyone who takes simultaneously into account the modems\u201d Constitution and the population of hybrids that that Constitution rejects and allows to proliferate,\u201d including monsters, cyborgs, and tricksters (1991, p. 47). If coding and code is replacing human language\u2014if not human functionality more generally\u2014Katherine Hayles\u2019s claim that \u201clanguage alone is no longer the distinctive characteristic of technologically developed societies; rather, it is language plus code\u201d (2005), can be extended to include language plus code plus algorithm (as language and action combined). Hayles\u2019s (1999) discussion of the 1952 novel Limbo demonstrates her understanding of Har away\u2019s claim that \u201ccyborgs are simultaneously entities and metaphors, living beings and narrative constructions\u201d (qtd. in Hayles 1999, p. 114). This is an idea that resurfaces at times of national anxiety about borders, contamination, privacy violations and dehumanising practices in relation to national/global \u201cadvancements.\u201d The novel offers some startlingly prescient assertions about human nature that bear upon this current discussion of human thing hybrid ity, archiving and deploying data, and the uncontrollability of scientific insatiability for innovations\u2019 sake. Hayles reviews how in Limbo (1952), Humans are essentially hyphenated creatures, he asserts, creative destructive, peaceful aggressive. The appearance on the island of \u201cqueer limbs,\u201d men who have had their arms and legs amputated and replaced by atomic powered plastic prostheses, brings Martine\u2019s philosophy of the hyphen into juxtaposition with the splice, the neolinguistic cutting, rejoining, and recircuiting that makes a cyb/ emetic org/anism into a cyborg. (Hayles 1999, p. 116) Dystopic or not, computer code represents the first real machine language that can deploy language as executable action instruction, and extends J. L. Austin\u2019s speech act theory into a kind of language as code that is capable of physically altering those things with which it is in communication. Similarly, Latour\u2019s notion of actants (2005) distinguishes between actors who \u201ctake action\u201d and actants that put action in motion, and which leave a trace, which helps us redefine \u201caction\u201d and thus agency, as beyond traditional human notions of \u201cintentional\u201d action. He formulates action as collectively rippling (as in groupthink, fads, and Zeitgeists, for example). Perhaps most helpfully for our consideration of archive, and if we take actants to be any things or entities that put action into motion, and which often have or create an affective trace at the same time, actants can easily have agency beyond or without humans. Actants queer notions of (the) archive without human intentionality or intervention. TRANSCODING AND A LOVE OF OOO AND WWO Transcoding3 is another area of digital activity and archiving in which machine relationships and language are impacting human understandings of gender, sexuality, and intelligibility. For example, Gerald Stephen Jackson (2017) draws on Katherine Hayles, as well as the \u201cqueer code art\u201d of Zach Bias\u2019s transCoder (2018), in order to argue a \u201cgender performativity of code.\u201d Jian Chen (2016) too researches transcoding as a nimble concept moving between gender and digital media practices. Chen has looked at the \u201ctrans embodied, transnational digital media\u201d of Cheang Shu Lea. For more than 30 years, Taiwan born queer digital nomad Cheang has produced new media art that highlights and plays with the boundaries of \u201cgender, racial ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, cultural genre, and technological medium\u201d (Chen 2016, p. 83). In particular, her \u201cpost pom\u201d digital film I.K.U. (2000) and its sequel UKI (2009 2012), a live video performance and online game, attends to \u201cnetworked media technologies and their new interfaces with viewers, who become users and players\u201d (Chen 2016, p. 83). Cheang\u2019s work asks viewers to consider racially, gendered, sexed, \u201cembodiment and biogenetics as motive forces in the restructuring and globalizing of political economies of the US, Western Europe, and the global North\u201d (Chen 2016, p. 83). Digital media practices and technology infrastructures are providing new ways of humans seeing not only the world but ourselves; less clear is how an IoT might contribute to advancement in things seeing themselves differently, and more autonomously from humans. The IoT suggests some ways in which things might be better predisposed to establishing and maintaining effective and ongoing connectivity that is mutually beneficial, unlike humans\u2019 difficulty with maintaining global ties without frequent ruptures and war. One way of synthesizing these somewhat disparate considerations of the archive, agency, and IoT, is through the notion of OOO (object oriented ontology). Dialling \u201ctriple O\u201d in Australia is the police emergency number, so we love that the OOO acronym for Object Oriented Ontology looks the same as \u201chelp seeking humanity.\u201d Perhaps as networked life advances, the idea of speed dialling an emergency phone number in case of ontological emergency will become obsolete and a voice activated call for help in smart homes will be de rigeur. It\u2019s been called the \u201cobject turn\u201d and like all \u201cmovements\u201d considerations of OOO are emerging across a wide range of disciplines including science, arts, and most obviously within computer and digital technology. As this book explores in a range of ways, it is not a huge leap from considering a \u201clife of things\u201d that is in service to (or compatible with) human supremacy and needs, to a consideration of things with their own independent lives that are neither driven by, nor much concerned with, humans at all. Whether anthropocentric experience is becoming obsolete as quickly as Myspace or not, the convergence of theoretical, philosophical and practical/ technological advances in the early twenty first century has made such considerations more palatable, yet here we argue that the notion of completely unseating human subjects remains ontologically queer, or even monstrous. After all, contemplating one\u2019s own annihilation is terrifying enough; considering our obsolescence is perhaps even more frightening. OOO4 (and its companion thread speculative realism) considers all nonhuman subjects (including immaterial) to be \u201cobjects\u201d or what we have here called things. Ideas are objects in OOO. This contrasts with some of the core principles of phenomenology which considers experience in relation to humans. OOO calls us to get out of our own heads, and into the \u201cminds\u201d of everything else around us (both seen and unseen). While OOO can be considered part of a (new) materialist or posthumanist approach to nonhuman egalitarianism (everything is equal), it also strives to separate the parts of an object from its effect. That is, an object is valuable and agentic as is, without a reduction to its constituent parts, or in relation to its impact (most usually on humans). OOO is useful for bringing together strands of thought about what is genera tively queer in the idea of things having lives (traces, resonances) independent of us. If (either digital, conceptual or material) things have increasingly dynamic networked lives which advance without the impact or influence of humans, how might that queer our consideration of the Anthropocene? IoT and OOO are like the children who blamed their (human) parents for everything that is wrong with their lives, and then begin to grow up and see how, despite an anthropogenically driven ecological mess, the machinistic and terrestrial lives in their own productive ways, despite us. Foundational OOO scholar Graham Harman describes his work as a tendency to \u201ctreat the inanimate world as a philosophical protagonist\u201d (2011, p. 25), and has urged us that \u201cto think a reality beyond our thinking is not nonsense, but obligatory\u201d (p. 26). However, recognizing the persistence of things as things in and as themselves, despite the havoc wrecked by (human) \u201cparents,\u201d doesn\u2019t, as Tim Ingold (2015) points out, have to allow things to simply \u201cbe themselves,\u201d thus subjecting them to a \u201cblobular ontology\u201d that fossilizes and isolates \u201cthings\u201d in space and time (p. 16). In response, Ingold offers us a World Without Objects (WWO)\u2014an ontology that holds on to the dynamism, animacy, and interconnectedness of things without object ifying them. \u201cBut we say,\u201d he writes: Things do not just exist; if they did, then they would indeed be objects. The thing about things, however, is that they occur\u2014that is, they carry on along their lines. This is to admit them into the world not as nouns but as verbs, as goings on. It is to bring them to life... Lives... can tie themselves into knots. The world of things, I propose, is a world of knots, a world without objects, (p. 16, emphasis in original) For the purposes of this book, thinking through things as both the agents of their own lives (through OOO) and as actions that both \u201cput out\u201d and \u201ccany along\u201d lines in a world of knots which includes the composition of nodes, interstices, and memories of their formation (in a WWO), is, for us a pretty queer proposition. ACTANT ARCHIVES AS BECOMING WITH In an age of virtual and material morphology, in this chapter we\u2019ve consider some, though not all, of the changing characteristics of the archive, and whether the notion itself is a static and outdated artefact of thingness. Archives by their nature imply pastness, and contemporary research into the queer lives of data stress instead their dynamic and emergent agency as actants. From the material proxy of artworks for inexpressible human emotions and relationships, to the agentic community of an Internet of Things, what was previously known as \u201clife\u201d may increasingly become understood as the queer lives of data in which ontological distinctions between \u201clive,\u201d \u201cdead,\u201d \u201cnonhuman,\u201d and \u201carchived\u201d are only stops along the way for digitally enhanced humans and animals, and affectively enhanced machines. Object and digital flows are not only agentic and networked but affective (Doveling et al. 2018). Things flow but so too do feelings, emotions, affects, events, and becomings with. Even seemingly \u201coutdated data\u201d such as a Van Gogh painting continue to circulate and recirculate in cycles of intra action and archival reincarnation, like Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s universe/ multiverse Library of Babel. If contemporary hybrid society is learning to balance integrated \u201conline\u201d and \u201coffline\u201d lifeworlds, then the notion of the archive becomes a living thing that not only has agency but the potential for autonomy. In such a worlding, humans may become just more databodies; the enfleshed repository for the digital archive that accompanies each of us. More, as humans increasingly become digitally enhanced physically as well as more virtually networked, our lives as events become archives of \u201cbroken data.\u201d Though too, we must think of archives as traces and repositories of not only material objects but also the need for empathy and understanding.

Queemess can, in hindsight, have a cumulative temporality, a queering of past experience as a catalyst to envision a potential future. Though this, too, is out of time\u2014the awareness that queer agency isn\u2019t what we imagine, in that \u201cpure agency\u201d sense of \u201cmarching forward, like a zombie going doggedly after what it wants\u201d (Stewart 2010, p. 6; Terada 2001). But it\u2019s not a passive becoming, either\u2014a kind of becoming whether you want to or not\u2014becoming as \u201ccouch potato passive,\u201d as Stewart (2010) puts it (p. 6). Becoming queer isn\u2019t like the softening and proliferation of potatoes left too long in a paper bag at the back of the refrigerator, growing eyes and limbs in the darkness until someone remembers to pull them out into the light. It\u2019s more like a state of attunement, when we attend \u201cto what might be happening... to possibilities opening up and not necessarily good ones. But maybe\u201d (p. 6). This chapter wonders about the relationship between queemess, bodies, time, and objects, writing toward a queering of bodies, time, and objects in what we are, for now, calling \u201cqueer object time.\u201d We begin with an exploration of the productive relations among objects, queemess, and time as an entanglement of matter and meaning (Dolphijn & van der Tuin 2012). Rather than invert the focus on the human body and language in favor of an anti anthropomorphic fascination with objects in and of themselves, we write to engage the messy, vibrant, and thoroughly queer relation we have to bodies, time, and objects as they unfold in the spaces of our work and our lives\u2014at home, in airports, in rehearsal, on the page. In bringing the critical scholarship of performativity and performance, queer and affect theory, and new materialism together, our queer object time dances at the edges of indeterminacy, matter and identity, radically open and infinite in its possibility (Barad 2015, p. 401). DANCING WITH A MERMAID A woman seated on a rock. A mermaid. A woman in bronze, reclining, one hand behind her hip, taking the sun. A woman reclining, open, her gaze fixed on an unknown horizon. A woman in bronze, nude, her breasts warmed by the sun glinting off the water. Her eyes squint, her vision blurs. She looks at me from her perch on my grandmother\u2019s dressing table. She is the most alive thing in this room, this house, this small Iowa town. A symbol of the movement and spacetime1 of my grandmother, her eventfulness, evidence of her having gone somewhere, once. Once, my grandmother went to Denmark and purchased a naked bronze woman on a stone. She packed the mermaid neatly into a suitcase between rolled socks and cotton underwear and travelled back, back, back to the small town and the house at the crest of a hill on the only gravel road between here and there. The mermaid sits on grandmother\u2019s dressing table. She looks at me from her perch, her gaze fixed, and tells me that she is the evidence, the hard, rock solid evidence of getting out. Of the possibility of spacetime travel. Of returning, if you want to, to a world that is both larger and smaller for having gone. Ahmed (2006) reminds us, though, that objects do not move us in and through spacetime\u2014that is, they do not take us \u201cback\u201d to a place or a past that is over and gone, nor do they compose a future by their arrangement in our homes or familiar geographies (p. 150). Rather, objects \u201ckeep the impressions\u201d of the past alive and in that keeping on, make \u201cnew impressions in the very weave or fabric of the present\u201d (p. 150). Objects are transistors, rather than transportation. When we travel and bring an object \u201chome,\u201d we enact the displacement and difference of our comings and goings; we make and remake home in the entanglement of here and there, now and then, strange and familiar. Indeed, homes and the objects that gather in their making, are material manifestations of the \u201centanglement of genealogies of dispersion with those of \u2018staying put\u2019\u201d (Brah 1996, p. 16). When the objects that compose a life are passed down, they are also passed around\u2014from hand to hand, and home to home, an inheritance and a becoming. Objects are passed around as well as down; their inheritance is less about preserving the past or inhabiting the present and more about welcoming an arrival from another, possible world (p. 150). *** I am looking for the woman seated on the rock, the bronze mermaid taking the sun, her gaze fixed on an unknown horizon. She is nude, open, warm; a symbol of my grandmother\u2019s movement outside her every day. I am looking for her, the bronze mermaid, as my father and his sisters tear through my grandmother\u2019s apartment, packing up her things, just hours after the last mourner left her funeral service. My father brushes past me in the living room carrying a carton overflowing with handbags. \u201cDo you want any of these?\u201d he says without stopping or slowing down. I\u2019m not sure, but I don\u2019t have a chance to say, no way to slow down the movements of children eager to box up their grief. My father moves past again, this time in the direction of the kitchen. \u201cDon\u2019t you want anything of hers?\u201d he says as he pulls open drawers full of silverware and napkins. \u201cShe\u2019d want you to have something of hers, to remember her. What about her jewelry? Or her clothes? She had a lot of nice things.\u201d \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want her clothes. And your sisters have split up the jewelry. I would like the mermaid, though.\u201d The noise in the kitchen stops. \u201cWhat mermaid?\u201d \u201cThe mermaid that used to sit on her dressing table. The bronze mermaid sitting on the rock.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think your grandmother had any mermaid.\u201d \u201cDid mom have a mermaid?\u201d My father yells in the direction of the bedroom, where his sisters are removing pantsuits and sweater sets from hangars. The noise in the bedroom stops. My aunt peeks her head around the doorjamb. \u201cThe trinket from the trip to the Denmark? The one from the airport souvenir shop?\u201d I\u2019m not sure, but I nod. \u201cLook in the box with the odds and ends. There on the floor next to the couch. She might be in there.\u201d I look down at the box sitting at my feet. Inside I see Uno cards in a cross stitched box, a travel sewing kit, a paper fan, several monogrammed handkerchiefs, and the woman sitting on a rock. Even in a collection of odds and ends she looks different. Odd among the collected objects of my grandmother\u2019s life. Out of place and spacetime. I pick her out of the box and hold her up to the light and see her for what seems like the very first time. I turn to the grieving siblings assembled in front of me. \u201cI\u2019d like to have this.\u201d Sometimes objects arrive\u2014in our hands and in our lives\u2014and we are thrown by their appearance, even though we have encountered them before (Ahmed 2006, p. 40). Even when we think we\u2019ve known \u201cthem\u201d all along. Sometimes, their arrival takes time, \u201cand the time that it takes shapes \u2018what\u2019 it is that arrives; the object is shaped by the conditions of its arrival\u201d (p. 40). Objects are shaped, too, but how we attune to them\u2014to see them perhaps for the \u201cvery first time,\u201d to see them differently. Shaped by the \u201cdirection\u201d of its matter, of how it has come to matter to us, now; or perhaps reconsidered all together\u2014not as thing we can hold, possess, or have, but instead as the \u201cdirection\u201d of matter itself, an orienting, attuning force (p. 40). *** We\u2019re walking through the food court in the Copenhagen airport on the way to our gate. We stop at the convenience store and wait in line to buy magazines and a pack of gum. I stare idly at the people across the way who are posing for a selfie. I smile when they say smile and hold my breath until I hear one of them say \u201cGot it.\u201d They gather their suitcases and roll away. Behind them, in the space opened up in their departure, a large bronze woman sitting on a rock snaps into view. She reclines, her gaze fixed on an unknown horizon. My lover puts one hand on my shoulder and points with the other. \u201cLook! It\u2019s the woman\u2014the woman on the rock on your night table. There she is!\u201d I smile and hold my breath. Grandmother\u2019s bronze mermaid is here, in the Copenhagen airport. She is a replica of Little Mermaid, the bronze and stone statue by Edvard Eriksen who has reclined waterside, waiting patiently for her human lover at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, for more than one hundred years. Though I didn\u2019t know this until just now, until her arrival into my line of vision in an airport so far from home. She\u2014and my grandmother and me\u2014are disorientated and dislodged in time and in relation. It\u2019s said that the little mermaid is a material manifestation of the character in Hans Christian Anderson\u2019s fairy tale of the same name, though she is, of course, a hybrid of many mermaids, women, and lovers\u2014 the mermaid of the story the ballerina Ellen Price, who danced her onto and across the stage at the Royal theatre, Eline Eriksen, who posed for her sculptor husband after Price refused to model in the nude (\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d 2018). She is also a hybrid of many mermaids perched in many places\u2014 her \u201coriginal\u201d casting at water\u2019s edge at Langelinje Pier her smaller bronze replica in terminal C in the Copenhagen airport her capitalist sister, named BIG Mermaid and designed by Bjarke Ingles Group, an \u201carchipelago of [plywood shelves holding] Scandinavian products amidst the flow of people\u201d moving through the airport\u2019s duty free zone, (\u201cBIG Mermaid\u201d 2013) her small materializations, sitting in row upon row on souvenir store shelves throughout Denmark her very particular manifestation on my grandmother\u2019s dresser and now, as an inherited object sitting in honor on my bedside table. In all of her materializations and matterings, she is what Ahmed (2006) describes as a \u201csticky object\u201d\u2014what she picks up on her surfaces, both \u201c\u2018shows\u2019 where she has travelled and what [and who] she has come into contact with\u201d (p. 40). Encountering the mermaid here, in the airport, is both strange and familiar. The mermaid in my line of sight telescopes out to all of the mermaids\u2014sitting on shelves, here, in the airport, and on dressers, there, in homes throughout the world. The mermaid leaps from the background of my vision and attention (what it is to know and be at \u201chome\u201d) and into a vibrant present, suddenly come to life. Ahmed says we make objects queer by attending to them, moving them from the background to the foreground and regarding them in spacetime (2006, p. 166). And more, objects become queer in their strangeness\u2014in the encounter of bodies and things\u2014that can bring them to life and make them dance (2006, p. 163). And queer in relation to objects and time (and object time) become a matter of \u201chow things appear, how they gather, how they perform, to create the edges of spaces and worlds\u201d (2006, p. 167). MAKING TIME, MARKING TIME Those of us who \u201cperform,\u201d\u2014that is, place ourselves in spaces we consciously mark off as \u201cstage time\u201d\u2014know what it means to work toward a future that seeks to make something happen. And when we ask how that happening happens, we seek to understand \u201cwhat is going on\u201d not only when we are performing but also when we repeat a series of actions in the belief that such goings over will eventuate into a performance. We describe the \u201cstrange temporality,\u201d of making performance with a backward looking, facing forward word: rehearsal. From re, again, and herder, to drag, to trail on the ground. To rake, harrow, rip, tear, wound. Repeat.2 When we rehearse, we go over and go through some thing, a \u201cpiece\u201d of music or a \u201cplay,\u201d preparing for a future event, situation or performance (OED). When we rehearse, \u201cwe recollect forwards whilst remembering backwards. We rehearse the future\u2014\u201csomething that doesn\u2019t yet exist\u201d\u2014\u201cinto being\u201d (Schmidt 2015, p. 5). Performance maker Tim Etchells (2012) writes of rehearsal room and the contemplation of those of us who gather there. We sit, staring into the emptiness, trying to imagine the things that might fill it. We engage in Tow level\u2019 fooling around, rearranging things in space; being stupid with props and costumes\u201d (p. 34). We wait. There is something queer about waiting\u2014those who wait are out of time in at least two ways\u2014we are \u201cout of straight time\u2019s rhythm\u201d and we make worlds in that waiting (Munoz 2009, p. 182). Halberstam\u2019s central assertion in A Queer Time and Place (2005) is that \u201cqueer temporality disrupts the normative narratives of time that form the base of nearly every definition of the human in almost all of our modes of understanding, from the professions of psychoanalysis and medicine to socioeconomic and demographic studies on which every sort of state policy is based, to our understandings of the affective and the aesthetic\u201d (p. 152). The meaning and value we assign to time and temporality are forged out of \u201cvibrant and volatile social relations\u201d (p. 7). By way of example, Halberstam contrasts \u201cfamily time,\u201d organized around the heteronormative re production of \u201cfamily, longevity, risk/safety and inheritance\u201d with \u201cqueer time,\u201d non normative modes of relationality and embodiment that emerge once we leave the disciplining structures of \u201cstraight\u201d time behind (p. 6; see also Harris, Holman Jones, Faulkner, & Brook 2017). By comparing object time with human time (as an extension of the queer time/straight time dialectic), we try to make visible the insistent waiting that characterizes so much of anthropocentric perspectives and practices. While we are not arguing that objects are free from waiting (or perhaps more accurately, the performance of waiting), we argue that queer object time might offer a more expansive notion of the not yet than does human time or straight time. The material entanglement of queemess, queer objects, and queer temporality is a \u201cdoing for and toward a future that is not yet here\u201d (Munoz 2009, p. 1). Etchells writes, too, of the frustrating, circular, and seemingly endless discussions that happen in rehearsal rooms spaces as a kind of gathering of energy\u2014which could be mistaken for treading water or rage or mild insanity, suggesting that such discussions and waiting and fooling around are necessary for something to snap into focus. He says it\u2019s a performance rehearsal version of the \u201ctalking cure.\u201d He writes that time passes slowly in the room with no windows, in which you spend your days whether it is raining or sun shining outside. You make things, slowly, very slowly, leaving behind a trail of failed attempts as nonsense and, if you are lucky, slowly, very slowly you accumulate a store of scenes and fragments that you love, that have puzzled and perplexed you in the good way, that have made you smile, that have made you weep, shake your head or that have made your heart beat faster, (p. 36) Rehearsing is the timespace of re collecting forwards, into the not yet. In the rehearsal room, our mission is more potato than zombie\u2014we are not single minded or zealous but rather multiple, sending out sprouts and feeling our way. It\u2019s a going over that engages us in attunement\u2014we tune in to what might be happening by waiting; by making things slowly, bit by bit. We accumulate a storehouse of things that puzzle and perplex us in the best way, the good way. They may not necessarily be \u201cgood\u201d things. But maybe. In another field, not so far away from the rehearsal room, Barad considers time and temporality through the lens of science experimentation. She affirms that even in science experimentation what we can see is that what is going on actually is the making of temporality... What we are seeing here is that time is not given, it is not universally given, but rather that time is articulated and re synchronized through various material practices... So what is going on here is that physicists are actually making time in marking time, and that there is a certain way in which what we take to be the \u201cpast\u201d and what we take to be the \u201cpresent\u201d and the \u201cfuture\u201d are entangled with one another, (qtd. in Dolphijn & van der Tuin 2012, p. 67) In science and in performance we make time by marking time, feeling our way toward the not yet by making some thing as the material entanglement of past, present, and future. Barad is well known for her considerations of agency, and the separation between subject and object\u2014that is, self and other (human and non human) in the research or observational relationship. For Barad, agency is not restricted to the \u201chuman\u201d or the causal or the \u201cfixed\u201d (in time, movement, matter or amount). Rather, agency is a doing, an iterative and intra active enactment of accountability and responsibility that happens in and through time\u2014though time here should be thought of as an operator, and not a parameter (2007, pp. 220, 437, emphasis ours). INTRA ACTION AS OBJECT TIME Barad has popularized the physics of things, objects and their existence or materiality as an encounter, or what she calls and intra action, in accessible ways like this: When we make a measurement, what happens is that it is not a matter of disturbing something and our knowledge is uncertain as a result, but rather there are not inherent properties and there are not inherent boundaries of things that we want to call entities before the measurement intra action. That is, Bohr is saying that things are indeterminate; there are no things before the measurement, and that the very act of measurement produces determinate boundaries and properties of things. So, his is an ontological principle rather than an epistemological one. In other words, for Bohr particles do not have a position independently of my measuring something called position. (Barad in Dolphijn & van der Tuin 2012, p. 63) One of Barad\u2019s primary projects is to shift mindsets around individualism and objectivity. For her, it is crucial to not think of objects or things in and of themselves, but rather in relation to, or in correlation to, human perception. In this sense, objects are agentic in their intra actions with other forces\u2014 human and non human alike. However, Barad\u2019s project is not to bestow objects with agency \u201cjust like\u201d that of humans\u2014a \u201cthing\u201d we possess or an ability to act with the purposefulness of \u201cpure agency.\u201d She writes, Just as there are no words with determinant meanings lying in wait... for an appropriate representational moment, neither are there things with determinant boundaries and properties whirling aimlessly in the void, bereft of agency, historicity or meaning, which are only to be bestowed from the outside.... \u201cThings\u201d don\u2019t pre exist; they are agentically enacted and become deteriminan tely bounded and propertied within phenomena [and] particular agential intraactions. (2007, p. 150) Things, like words, are not storehouses of possibility waiting to be activated when the \u201cagency of Man\u201d performatively \u201cpronounces the name that attaches to specific beings in the making\u201d (p. 150). Things, like words and like subjects, are performative\u2014that is, they are reiteratively rehearsed into being. And while it may a \u201cbit queer\u201d to ask questions about the intra active, performative agency of nonhuman forms in the \u201cactive and not just discursive materialisation of a body sex,\u201d (Parisi 2008, p. 286) Barad asks us to do just that. Barad\u2019s ideas about performativity lead us away from the becomings of individual entities and toward collectivities; queer object time might represent one aspect of Barad\u2019s entangled \u201cmaterial discursive intra actions\u201d across spacetimemattering,3 a proposition that presumes no prior existence of the phenomena intra acting in their inseparable encounters/entanglements, thus challenging conventional notions of an ontology of determinacy. Her assertion that all bodies and things (and not just human ones) matter asks us to see, queerly, performativity in all its iterative, perverse, and indeterminate intra activity (2012, p. 32). QUEER CONTACT Sedgwick argued performativity\u2019s genealogy is inherently queer (Parisi 2008, p. 286; Sedgwick 1993). Here, queer is a pivot, shifting a conversation about the linguistic force of speech to a consideration of the relational resonances things and words have with time, orientations, and subjects: A word so fraught as \u201cqueer\u201d is\u2014fraught with so many social and personal histories of exclusion, violence, defiance, excitement\u2014never can only denote; nor even can it only connote; a part of its experimental force as a speech act is the way in which it dramatizes locutionary position itself. Anyone\u2019s use of \u201cqueer\u201d about themselves means differently from their use of it about someone else.... \u201cQueer\u201d seems to hinge much more radically and explicitly on a person\u2019s undertaking particular, performative acts of experimental self perception and filiation. A hypothesis worth making explicit: that there are important senses in which \u201cqueer\u201d can signify only when attached to the first person. One possible corollary: that what it takes\u2014all it takes\u2014to make the description \u201cqueer\u201d a true one is the impulsion to use it in the first person. (1993, p. 9) Right from the beginning, for Sedgwick queer was at once an \u201cexperimental linguistic, epistemological, representational, political adventure\u201d that attached itself to ideas of (new) materialism and affect. Her use of impulsion echoes Erin Manning\u2019s (2009) articulation of affect as pre acceleration, \u201cthe vital force of movement taking form\u201d; the \u201cbody becoming,\u201d a performance of self that is at once material and temporal, and relational (p. 6). Sedgwick (1993), like Butler, was interested in \u201cthe implications for gender and sexuality of a tradition of philosophical thought concerning certain utterances that do not merely describe, but actually perform the actions they name\u201d (p. 11). Her investigations into \u201clinguistic performativity\u201d became \u201ca place to reflect on ways in which language really can be said to produce effects: effects of identity, enforcement, seduction, and challenge\u201d (p. 11). Sedgwick moves beyond J. L. Austin\u2019s (1962) overt (and perhaps obsessive) focus on the marriage vow as the proto example of the performative utterance4 to focus on the affectively dynamic and intra active performance of shame to demonstrate the queer potentiality of performativity. She writes, \u201cShame floods into being as a moment, a disruptive moment, in a circuit of constituting identificatory communication\u201d (2003 p. 36). In the affective flush and force of shame, Sedgwick reads not a passive happening but an active \u201cstrategy for the production of meaning and being\u201d (p. 11). In other words, queemess is intra active agency, a doing in time, rather than a destination. That doing is a practice of attunement\u2014attending to \u201cwhat\u2019s happening, sensing out, accreting attachments and detachments, differences, losses and proliferating possibilities\u201d (Stewart 2010, p. 4). Ahmed reads Sedgwick\u2019s attention to shame\u2014rather than the heterosexual promise of an \u201cI do\u201d or the positivity of gay pride\u2014as the \u201cprimary queer affect\u201d because it holds onto \u201cthe not\u201d (and the negation of ordinary culture) that is, for better and worse, a part of the intra active \u201cdoing in time\u201d of queemess (Ahmed 2006, p. 175). Or as Sedgwick put it now so long ago in Tendencies (1993), queer is \u201cthe open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone\u2019s gender, of anyone\u2019s sexuality aren\u2019t made (or can\u2019t be made) to signify monolithically\u201d (p. 8). Queemess as a refusal to let go of the not/negation and to turn bad feelings into (only) good ones (Ahmed 2006, p. 175) also reminds of how things\u2014 not necessarily good ones\u2014both happen and accumulate in spacetime and on surfaces and in our hands. Ahmed\u2019s writing table. Chen\u2019s (2012) couch. Sedgwick\u2019s silk and shit (2000). Sedgwick links performativity with the material relations of queemess, asking us to think about, as Ahmed later puts it, how queer objects are available as \u201cthings\u201d to \u201cdo\u201d things with (Ahmed 2006, p. 168). Ahmed (2007) notes: \u201cA queer object hence makes contact possible. Or, to be more precise, a queer object would have a surface that support such contact. The contact is bodily, and it unsettles that line that divides spaces as worlds, thereby creating other kinds of connections where unexpected things can happen\u201d (p. 169). That support\u2014that contact\u2014hinges on the \u201csticky\u201d touching integral to the intra activity of queer objects, subjects and time. It\u2019s also a highly pleasurable\u2014some might say \u201cperverse\u201d take on the worlding of the world (Barad 2012). Indeed, Barad uses of the notion of \u201cself touching\u201d to describe the pleasure and sociality of self other relations, writing: Self touching is an encounter with the infinite alterity of the self Matter is an enfolding, an involution, it cannot help touching itself and in this self touching it comes in contact with the infinite alterity that it is. [Freud\u2019s] polymorphous perversity raised to an infinite power: talk about a queer intimacy! What is being called into question here is the very nature of the \u201cself,\u201d and in terms of not just being but also time. (Barad 2012, pp. 399 400) Nature, Barad writes, \u201cis perverse at its core; nature is unnatural\u201d (Barad 2015, p. 412). The unpredictable and in some ways inexplicable actions so called \u201cnatural\u201d phenomena, for example in the behavior of atoms, becomes a \u201cmoral violation\u201d of what humans want or expect to see in nature. She writes (paraphrasing Richard Feynman) that an \u201celectron\u2019s monstrous nature and its perverse ways of engaging with the world\u201d\u2014both in its behavior but also, perhaps more compellingly, in its infinitude, \u201cthreatens the very possibility of calculability\u201d (p. 400). Such incalculability, according to Barad, is \u201ca queer theorist\u2019s delight. It shows that all of matter, matter in its \u2018essense \u2019 (of course, that is precisely what is being troubled here), is a massive overlaying of perversities: an infinity of infinities\u2019, (pp. 400 401). She concludes: \u201cperversity andmonstros ity lie at the core of being\u2014or rather, it is threaded through it\u201d (p. 401). Barad urges us to move beyond using the same old reductive arguments to argue for/against marginalization of certain humans and nonhumans over others; she urges us to move into new logics which attend to the material and more than dualistic: In particular, the \u201cposthumanisf \u2019 point is not to blur the boundaries between human and nonhuman, not to cross out all distinctions and differences, and not to simply invert humanism, but rather to understand the materializing effects of particular ways of drawing boundaries between \u201chumans\u201d and \u201cnonhumans.\u201d (2011 p. 123) Where performativity has been central to the anti teleological project of queer theory, Barad\u2019s quantum ontology shows us \u201chow language and discourse are haptic encounters... suggesting a massive intimacy across a spectrum of possible envelopments\u201d (de Freitas 2017, p. 744). She pushes us to think about category making practices (always a verb) themselves, asking after the nonhuman in our accounts of \u201cabjection, subjection, agency, and materialization\u201d (Barad 2011, p. 124). Our boundary making itself is a materializing practice that matters. The distinctions and difference we make and mark between human/nonhuman, animate/inanimate and cultural/natural\u2014 include \u201cthe materializing effects of boundary making practices by which the \u2018human\u2019 and the \u2018nonhuman\u2019 are differentially constituted\u201d (p. 32). Both Elizabeth de Freitas (2017) and Braidotti (2014) have used Barad\u2019s version of polymorphous perversity to discuss the new materialist shift to sexuality to \u201cexplore more specifically the notion of sexuality beyond gender\u201d (Braidotti 2014, p. 242). For feminist new materialists, Barad\u2019s conceptualisation of polymorphous perversity is an ontological door through which to move into an experimental practice, one that makes a difference in how it holds us together through \u201cquantum touch\u201d (de Freitas 2017, p. 747). Barad is careful to point out that her exploration of the queemess of atoms, nonhuman agency, and \u201cqueer critter behaviours,\u201d \u201cdoes not ward off panicked attempts to contain, tame, or normalize nature\u2019s queemess, which will not be quarantined and [are] always threatening to leak out and contaminate \u2018life as we know it\u2019\u2014turning the funhouse, freak show of atoms\u2019 perverse putterings into an anxiety inducing largescale \u2018catastrophe\u2019\u201d (2012, p. 45). Though, again, Barad\u2019s quantum ontology and agental realism cautions us against bestowing any kind of pure agency to the self, matter, or the quantum theory that puts us in contact. As interesting as it is to \u201cspeculate about the capacity for animacy, vitalism or consciousness in the non human world\u201d (Davidson & Rooney 2018, p. 2), Sedgwick, Barad and Ahmed (and others) urge us reconsider the relationship of the material, psychodynamic, linguistic and performative, asking what matter matters as onto epistemological opening to the reciprocal relations among queer objects and subjects. In asking the question what matter matters, we must also consider how turning matter into [mere] objects catches us up in the relational shell game Haraway (2008) describes as \u201cmaking killable\u201d (p. 80). MAKING KILLABLE/TOXICITY AS AN ASSET It\u2019s the kind of snapping into attention that happens when we least expect or want it. Like the kind of attention our friend Craig Gingrich Philbrook writes about on social media the morning after taking a beloved pet to the emergency vet in the hard hours of the night. The pause and spreading dread of what ifs set off by the spouse/co owner line on the intake form. The form and the representation of kinship and/as sovereignty becomes singular and charged, at once weighty and diffuse like a \u201cheadache induced by a shift in the barometric pressure\u201d (Stewart 2013b). Time \u201cspeeds and slows\u201d; \u201cspace stretches out and pulls in as an immediate surround\u201d (Stewart 2013b). Questions crowd out the alarm bells ringing in the body: Will writing Jonny\u2019s name set in motion its own alarm bells\u2014homophobic fear and rage and with it the denial of emergency care for a beloved under the \u201cright\u201d to refuse service? In what other waiting rooms does such \u201cintimate terror\u201d reign? What is the calculus of counting which or whose lives matter in such shape shifting moments of potentiality and loss (Berlant 2011)? In When Species Meet, Haraway (2008) introduces the concept of \u201cmaking killable,\u201d or \u201cdevelopment of categories to contain those, human and nonhuman, who are dispensable and killable\u201d (p. 38). Making killable \u201cturns people and animals into always already objects ready for violence, genocide, slavery\u201d (Tuck & Ree 2013, p. 649). However, the mass production and destruction of beings as objects does not happen elsewhere\u2014in some cubicle or cupboard where categories are made and instantiated. It happens, instead, in the boundary materializing work of facing each other. When we look into the eyes of an other. This facing is both heartbreakingly ruthless and hopeful\u2014ruthless in Emmanuel Levinas\u2019s sense that when we look into the eyes of \u201cthe other in its precariousness and defenselessness\u201d and at once feel \u201cthe temptation to kill,\u201d and hopeful in the relational and ethical pull of the \u201ccall to peace, the [commandment] \u201cyou shall not kill\u201d (Levinas 1996, p. 167). The simultaneous \u201ctemptation to kill [and] demand for peace\u201d (Butler 2006, p. 135) evidences need to \u201cface up\u201d to human exceptionalism that lies at the heart of Haraway\u2019s (2008) discussion making killable. She writes:... what my people and I need to let go of if we are to leam to stop extermin ism and genocide... is the command \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d The problem is not figuring out to whom such a command applies so that \u201cother\u201d killing can go on as usual and reach unprecedented historical proportions.... Perhaps the commandment should read, \u201cThou shalt not make killable.\u201d... Facing up to the outrage of human exceptionalism will, in my view, require severely reducing human demands on the more than human world... [and] require working for the mortal entanglements of human beings and other organisms in ways that one judges, without guarantees, to be good, that is to deserve a future, (pp. 80, 106) If the industrial complex (and the normative heterosexual orientation that (re)produces it) turns all living beings into objects\u2014\u201cthings\u201d to \u201cdo things\u201d with, it also helps us see the relational intra activity subject and object. In facing up to making killable, we reckon with how bodies are bounded and entangled, precarious and enmeshed, infinite and ephemeral. And by bodies here we mean individual bodies as well as collective bodies. A case in point: In November 2017, we join the \u201cvictory\u201d march the day after clearing the final in an excruciating number of hurdles in the fight for marriage equality in Australia. After our plans to gather and celebrate with others right then and there were dashed by rain and a long delayed vote in parliament, we turned up the day after and joined a march through Melbourne\u2019s CBD. Already we felt both time weary and out of time. As we marched, we chanted in verse with the slogans coming through the megaphone\u2014wc\u2019rc here, we\u2019re queer, we\u2019re getting married next year... we\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, we\u2019re getting married next year... we\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer...\u201d With each repetition, we became more and more... uncomfortable. What about our queer friends and family who weren\u2019t here\u2014because they don\u2019t have the time or ability to turn up to a march that began before the working day ended, because they don\u2019t want to get married, next year or ever, or because they were no longer alive, after having waited so long for this day, these [and so many other] rights, to come? We wondered if the time for \u201cwe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer,\u201d had passed; if it was a kind of \u201coverkill\u201d that overlooked just how hard it\u2019s been to imagine such the future, turning it into a \u201cspecter, a pure virtuality\u201d (Fisher 2014, p. 22). Though the border between \u201clife\u201d and \u201cdeath,\u201d and \u201chere\u201d and \u201cqueer,\u201d as we\u2019ve noted above, are not certain or sure; \u201cmaking killable\u201d and \u201coverkill\u201d are intra active encounters, rather than time bound happenings. And the fuzzy borders we tiy to put up around life and death/here and queer can happen \u201cwithout human bodies present, quite beyond questions of personification\u201d (Chen 2012, p. 265). In their consideration of toxicity and contamination, Chen takes up queer debates about life and death, proposing the idea of toxicity as \u201can extant queer bond\u201d that complicates \u201cutopian imagining\u201d (p. 265). Chen considers their own sensitivity to toxins to think about not only how queer people are, in many ways, made killable in how they are \u201ctreated as toxic assets,\u201d but also to \u201cask after the desires, the loves, the rehabilitations, the affections, the assets that toxic conditions induce\u201d (p. 281). In Chen\u2019s rendering, toxic assets and intimacies are not the exclusive realm of the sentient or the animate but extend to the inanimate and the blurry borders we put around \u201cliving and dead.\u201d They write: What is lost when we hold tightly to that exceptionalism that says that couches are dead and we are alive? For would not my nonproductivity, my nonhuman sociality, render me some other human\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d... ? Or must couches be ca thected differently from humans? (p. 281) Chen writes contamination and toxicity as a performative thing in time, an \u201casset\u201d that instantiates \u201cqueer bonds already here: the living dead, the dead living, antisocial love, in inanimate affection\u201d (p. 265). In its best versions, queer toxicity \u201cpropels, not repels, queer loves, especially once we release it from exclusively human hosts\u201d (p. 281). Barad questions whether \u201cqueemess might be seen to reside not in the breech of nature/culture, per se, but in the very nature of spacetimemattering,\u201d with the meta goal it seems (at least in part) of \u201claying bare the ways in which moralism feeds off of human exceptionalism, and, in particular, human superiority and causes injury to humans and non humans alike\u201d (2012, p. 53). In other words, queemess as a verb, not an object, not an identity, resides in its nature as a doing\u2014or in nature itself, as a doing. She famously and effectively uses physics and biological sciences to revisit the problematic dichotomizing of individualism/collectivism, micro/ macro scale organism behaviors, and perhaps most importantly for the queerness discussion, the power of mutation. \u201cSocial amoebas queer the nature of identity, calling into question the individual/group binary\u201d (2012, p. 26), a starting point which helps her move from the microscopic to the enormous and everywhere in between. Over and over she proves that nature is not anything like what humans think we know, but instead active \u201cco workers,\u201d thanking the amoeba for its flexibility, resilience and assistance in her argument. Perhaps in her most populist flourish, she asks \u201cBut what if Nature hirself is a commie, a pervert, or a queer?\u201d (Barad 2012, p. 29). Ironically anthropomorphic, given her interest in \u201c... \u2018anthropomorphizing\u2019 as an intervention for shaking loose the crusty toxic scales of anthropocentricism, where the human in its exceptional way of being gets to hold all the \u2018goodies\u2019 like agency, intentionality, rationality, feeling, pain, empathy, language, consciousness, [and] imagination\u201d (p. 27). Barad\u2019s meta project of deconstructing human centeredness hinges on laying bare the \u201cstinging character of moralism, particularly as it is directed at securing the nature/culture divide\u201d (2012, p. 28), a system of thought and sociocultural construction that statically places humans at the \u201csacred\u201d center of the need for this divide. To support her argument, she draws on a host of jaw dropping (but not new) examples of persistent sodomy laws and frustrat ingly patronizing institutionalizations of how queer sex is a \u201ccrime against nature,\u201d continually reinforcing the links between nature, heterosexism, and patriarchy for its logic. In support (unsurprisingly, but satisfyingly), her argument about the queemess of nature itself is underpinned by a long series of examples of homosexual, bisexual, and trans* sexual behaviors from \u201cnature\u201d... (in fact, citing over 450 animal examples now known)\u2014and this only in animals per se, not organisms more broadly. NOT YET A LIGHTNING BOLT \u201cBirth and death,\u201d Barad writes, \u201care not the sole prerogative of the animate world; so called inanimate beings also have finite lives\u201d (2012, p. 394).5 Consider, for example, her meditation on lightning: A dark sky. Deep darkness, without a glimmer of light to settle the eye. Out of the blue, tenuous electrical sketches scribbled with liquid light appear/disappear faster than the human eye can detect. Flashes of potential, hints of possible lines of connection alight now and again.... Against a dark sky it is possible to catch glimmers of the wild energetics of indeterminancies in action.... Lightning bolts are bom in a lively play of in/determinancy, troubling matters of self and other, past and future, life and death. It electrifies our imaginations and our bodies. If lightning enlivens the boundary between life and death, it exists on the razor\u2019s edge between animate and inanimate, does it not seem to dip sometimes here and sometimes there on either side of the divide. (2012, pp. 387 388) Barad\u2019s sexy connection between the build up of lightning as/and a sexual attraction between the (atoms and their components) in the land and the clouds reminds us that humans and our embodied, intellectual, and emotional landscapes are part of the vast replications of nature\u2019s patterns, rather than the other way around (nature mirroring \u201cus\u201d). It also demonstrates in beautiful detail how dynamic and \u201calive\u201d the so called inanimate and world is. The event that is lightning doesn\u2019t happen in a continuous (in time) or contiguous (in space) or hierarchical (from cloud to ground) fashion. Instead, lightning is an example of a strangely animate inanimate relating in a process of an enlivening attunement: \u201cWhen \u2018awareness\u2019 occurs, a traveling spark is initiated from the point to be struck and propagates upward to meet the downward\u201d moving sparks cloud and the spurts of electrons they set off (2012, p. 398). These are \u201cfirst gestures\u201d of a lightening, but they are not lightning bolt just v\u2019c?/. The lighting, the way it comes together, in a play of difference and waiting, is call and response performance in which awareness gathers in a process of attunement to that surplus charge and traveling spark. Lightning as a performance of attunement in and across time resonates with Jose Esteban Munoz\u2019s theorization of queer futurity. He writes: Queemess is not yet here. Queemess is an ideality. Put another way, we are not yet queer. We may never touch queemess, but we can feel it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality. We have never been queer, yet queerness exists for us as an ideality that can be distilled from the past and used to imagine a future. (Munoz 2009, p. 1) While we may never touch queemess, we can feel it in the sparks and responses, in the ways we rehearse on the ground our connection to \u201cwith what\u2019s coming down,\u201d attending to \u201cthe clouds seductive overtures\u201d (p. 397). Barad asks, \u201cWhat mechanism is at work in this communicative exchange between sky and ground when awareness lies at the crux of this strangely animated inanimate relating?... What kind of queer communication is at work here?\u201d (Barad 2012, p. 398). Munoz\u2019s answer might be that it\u2019s a \u201cdoing... the performative as a force of and for futurity\u201d (p. 182). The queer temporalities in Munoz\u2019s theorizing are, like Barad\u2019s lightning, \u201cdifferent and outside,\u201d insistently pulling in \u201ctime and place that is simultaneously not yet here but able to be glimpsed on our horizon\u201d (p. 183). Elsewhere, Munoz (2015) writes that the \u201cincommensurate thought project\u201d of queer\u2014that is, \u201ccasting a picture of arduous modes of relationality that persist in the world despite stratifying demarcations and taxonomies of being\u201d and classification\u2014is \u201cthe active self attunement to life as varied and unsorted correspondences, collisions, intermeshings and accords between people and nonhuman objects, things, formations and clusterings\u201d (p. 210). In the not yet of lightning and queer futurities, we get caught up in the process of attuning to \u201cthe potential and actual vastness of being with\u201d objects (p. 201). In other words, we get caught up in queer object time. QUEER REGENERATION AND FLESHY HOPES We openly contemplate the possible tautology of something like queer object time. Still, we have tried to consider how the lives of objects queers normative time relations, object relations and relational orientations. We take Dol phijn & van der Tuin\u2019s (2012) invitation to search not for the objectivity of things in themselves but for an objectivity of actualization and realization... for how matter comes into agential realism, how matter is materialized in it. [We are] interested in speeds and slownesses, in how [an] event unfolds according to the inbetween, according to intra action [and] studying the multiplicity of modes that travel natureculture as the perpetual flow it has always already been. (2012, p. 113) In linking Barad\u2019s meditations on the queemess of \u201cbeing time indeterminancy\u201d and Munoz\u2019s queer potentialities, we are rehearsing an imaginative and, yes, hope ful play of binaries (here/there, now/then, subject/object, animate/inanimate) that reads the disparate \u201cparts\u201d of queer\u2014object\u2014time as entangled and intra active. We feel into why entanglements so often come back to binaries, even while we move and live in multiplicities. We wonder if queer object time might be a useful way to hold the binary not binary in the forefront of our thinking. By making things slowly, bit by bit, we are going over what promise the \u201cuncountable and generative\u201d the parts and pieces of queer\u2014object\u2014time hold in their \u201cuncountable and generative entanglements\u201d and \u201congoing reconfiguring\u201d (Barad 2015, p. 407). The queemess of nature envelopes us all, disrupting predictable or \u201cstraight\u201d notions of time, bodies, and relations. It is an instantiation of becoming object, an always already encounter that is both static and dynamic, fluid and material, relational, and multi directional. In its multiplicity and multidirectionality, queer object time offers an encounter that rejects the human/nonhuman binaries, seeing objects and humans as co existent events rather than ontological categories in competition for resources or recognition. As event, the becoming object of queer object time is invested in reconfiguring and regenerating what might yet be (Barad 2015, p. 402). *** The mermaid\u2014the one at Langelinje pier\u2014and also the others, has persisted and regenerated. She\u2019s been banned from Facebook for breaching its nudity guidelines (\u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d 2017). She has been the backdrop for protest, dressed in a burqa in protest off Turkey joining the EU, splashed with red paint in protest of whaling in the Faroe Islands and covered in blue and white paint to draw attention to the case of Abdulle Ahmed, a Somali man who has been held for more than a decade in a Danish psychiatric hospital (\u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d 2017). She has also been the subject of all manner of violence: her arm was sawn off by drunken men and she was beheaded twice\u2014first by the artist Jorgen Nash in a fit of rage after his lover left him and again by an unnamed \u201cRadical Feminist Faction\u201d seeking to \u201ccreate a symbol of the sexually fixated and misogynist male dream of women as bodies without heads\u201d (\u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d 2017). At the age of ninety, she was found floating face down in the harbor after explosives placed by anti war protestors angry about Danish involvement in Iraq blew her off her rock (\u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d 2017). After each defacement and dismemberment, the mermaid has been cleaned and polished, her parts recast and reattached. Her body has been pulled from the water and refixed to its stone perch. More than enduring in time, the mermaid is \u201can ongoing reconfiguring of spacetimemattering\u201d (Barad 2015, p. 411). She doesn\u2019t change, evolving from \u201cthis\u201d to \u201cthat\u201d version of herself; instead what the mermaid in the harbor, and on the dressers of grandmothers and queer women scattered around the world might be, as a becoming object, is an \u201citerative reworking of past, present, future integral to the play of the indeterminacy of being time\u201d (Barad 2015, p. 411). *** In underlining nature\u2019s queemess, Barad focuses our attention on the power and immeasurable beauty\u2014and not only the terror, the making killable\u2014of the interdeterminate, the unintelligible, and the monstrous. Pivoting on the importance of lightning in Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Barad reflects on the shock of the unintelligible and the monstrous if not for nature, then for nature culture: \u201cShocking brute matter to life. What makes us think matter is lifeless to begin with?\u201d (Barad 2012, p. 389). For Barad, Frankenstein\u2019s \u201cmonster\u201d and other \u201c\u2018ultra queer\u2019 critters with their quantum quotidian qualities queer queemess itself in their radically deconstructive ways of being\u201d (Barad 2012, p. 25). Queemess explodes not only material binaries, but also temporal and spatial ones. Barad\u2019s notions of emergence and agential realism both attend to queer\u2019s power to galvanize and animate the potentiality of the electric circuit between bodies, time, and objects, she writes: The (re)generative possibilities are endless. Fodder for potent trans* imaginar ies for reconfiguring future/past lived realities, for regenerating what never was but might yet have been. Can we cultivate bioelectrical science\u2019s radical potential, subverting Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s grab for power over life itself, aligning (neo)galvanism with trans* desires, not in order to have control over life but to empower and galvanize the disenfranchised and breathe life into new forms of queer agency and embodiment? Can we (re)generate what was missing in fleshiness but materially present in virtuality? Can we (re)generate what our bodies sense but cannot yet touch?... And if these fleshy hopes feel cruel to us sometimes, especially perhaps when reality seems impossibly hard and fixed and our own naturalcultural bodies and desires feel immobilized, if there are times when we have to face the knife, tear ourselves open, draw blood, might a regenerative politics with all its monstrously queer possibilities still serve to recharge our imaginations and our electric body spirits, helping us transition from momentary political and spiritual rigor mortis to living raging animacy?... There is no illusion of queer regeneration being a bloodless affair. (Barad 2015, p. 411 412). When we tune into the \u201cfleshy hopes\u201d of what queer agency and embodiment cannot yet feel and touch, recognizing that the now is not enough while imagining a future, we \u201creconfigure anew seemingly disparate parts\u201d (Barad 2015, p. 407). In this chapter, we have accumulated a storehouse of \u201cthings\u201d that puzzle and perplex us in the best way: mermaids and monsters, intimate terrors and toxic assets, potatoes and lightning bolts. And in writing these things in queer object time, we have re collected them forwards while remembering backwards (Schmidt 2015, p. 5), tracing their entanglements, responding to their (and our) yearnings for connection, assembling them (and ourselves) into fields of ^onging^elonging, regenerating what never was but might yet be. They might not necessarily be \u201cgood\u201d things. But maybe. NOTES 1. In the preface to Erin Manning\u2019s (2013) Always More Than One, Brian Mas sumi describes Manning\u2019s concept of spacetime as the inseparability of space and time; spacetime brings \u201cseriation and contingency together in the unfolding of the event\u201d (p. xvi). Manning writes that the movement of bodies and the bodying forth of thought\u2014the immanence of movement moving and thought becoming movement\u2014 creates the possibility in which \u201cspacetime itself begins to vibrate with movement expression\u201d (p. 101). In this book, we bring together spacetime and, writing toward moments and orientations of attunement when objects \u201cexceed their form\u201d and create the \u201ccapacity to dislodge the you that you thought you were\u201d (pp. 101 102). We are attuned to and write toward Sarah Ahmed\u2019s work in Queer Phenomeology (2006), in which she considers the relation among orientations and objects, writing about queer objects, or perhaps more precisely queering objects. She notes that \u201cqueer objects\u201d \u201ccome to life\u201d (p. 163) when they come into contact with bodies; they \u201cexceed their form\u201d unsettling the lines that divide \u201cspaces [and spacetime] as worlds, thereby creating other kinds of connections where unexpected things can happen\u201d (p. 169). 2. Etymology of rehearse from etymonline.com. 3. Barad\u2019s (2012) notion of spacetimemattering offers a way of thinking about how both size and time collide in/as matter, a very queer disruption of that particular binary indeed. 4. The \u201cI do\u201d as an instantiation of a presumed and individually agentic hetero normativity\u2014one thinks here, again, of the zombie marching ever forward in dogged pursuit of the inheritance and privilege that is heteronormative relationality. 5. For more on the lives of \u201cinanimate objects,\u201d see chapter 4, \u201cQueer Ecologies,\u201d on stromatolites. Chapter Four Queer Ecologies THE NONHUMAN BREATH: ROCKS (AND OTHERS) THAT BREATHE In northwest Australia, about a day north of Perth at Hamelin Station Reserve in Shark Bay UNESCO World Heritage Area, there is a large colony of living stromatolites (Greek for \u201clayered rock\u201d), which are reportedly the oldest known form of life on earth, and which some claim are the main reason oxygen breathing beings such as humans can live on this planet today. They are \u201cmicrobial reefs created by cyanobacteria (formerly known as blue green algae)\u201d (Bush Heritage Australia 2017). They were believed to be extinct until recently when living stromatolites were discovered in Shark Bay, and they have become quite a (human) tourist draw. Not to confuse the Shark Bay stromatolites with DEAD ones, which are visitable in a range of places in Australia and other locations like Canada. Dead stromatolites are commonly known as FOSSILS and are of lesser interest, apparently due to our collective obsession with the animate in all its formations. Stromatolites are the oldest living organisms on the planet, and as persistent breathers, have something to tell us about not only nonhuman animacies but also queer time. Bush Heritage Australia tells us that Stromatolites are the reason why we\u2019re alive today! Before cyanobacteria, the air was only 1 percent oxygen. Then, for 2 billion years, our photosynthesising Stromatolites pumped oxygen into the oceans (like underwater trees, before trees existed). When the oceans\u2019 waters were saturated, oxygen was released into the air, and with around 20 percent of oxygen in the air, life was able to flourish and evolve. Even today you can see Stromatolites \u201cfizzing\u201d underwater, releasing oxygen. (2017) There are only two places left where Stromatolites thrive: the Bahamas and Western Australia, but the Western Australian colony is far bigger and more robust. Climate change and human interference are the two greatest threats to the Stromatolites. To think about the Earth as its own subject or ecology/network that had a first breath is both anthropomorphic and also beautifully absent of the ubiquitous human focus of \u201cthe breath\u201d as a notion of animacy. As new materialism separates notions like agency and affect from humans, the possibility of pursuing the breath and a thread for unravelling the human in all forms of animacies is generative for us. In our formulation of queer object time (chapter 3), we focused on the theorization of things\u2019 temporal queering of human centered notions of linearity and temporality. In this chapter, we integrate current discussions on the Anthropocene, the entanglements of things and thoughts, and animacies into our broader consideration of queer ecologies (that is, as we have it, ecologies which effectively move beyond the human). Extending Shannon Winnubst\u2019s \u201cnormative\u201d ideas of time and space (2006), this chapter establishes the foundations of humanity\u2019s queering of the range of natural/biological to digital environments (ecologies) in which we find ourselves. The notion of this era as the Anthropocene, a period in which human impact is increasingly clearly having irreversible and destructive effects, is the backdrop before which this chapter is laid out; our writing seeks to link micro with the macro understandings of the queemess amidst this age of terror. QUEERING THE ANTHROPOCENE There is general agreement that we are now living in a period increasingly defined by negative human impact on global ecosystems. The Anthropocene1 refers to the most recent geologic time period on Earth, characterized by human influence, based on overwhelming global evidence that atmospheric, geologic, hydrologic, biospheric, and other earth system processes are now altered (mostly negatively) by humans. Not to capitulate to epoch binaries (or any other binaries that we continue to work against here), but the Anthropocene can be considered in contra distinction to what geomicrobiologist Kurt Konhauser, at the University of Alberta, calls The Great Oxidation Event, a moment approximately 2.5 billion years ago which roughly marked the beginning of oxygen breathing life (Thornhill 2011). Since its articulation in 2000,2 the notion of the Anthropocene has taken hold for a global population buffeted by political, economic, military and perhaps most importantly, environmental instability. Haraway (2015) reminds us that it\u2019s more than climate change; it\u2019s also extraordinary burdens of toxic chemistry, mining, depletion of lakes and rivers under and above ground, ecosystem simplification, vast genocides of people and other critters in systemically linked patterns that threaten major system collapse after major system collapse after major system collapse. Recursion can be a drag. (p. 159) Discussions of the Anthropocene abound, with critical interrogations of consumer cultures, digital disembodiments/dismemberment, and a raft of other queer considerations. Haraway along with others believes \u201cthe Anthropocene is more a boundary event than an epoch\u201d (p. 160), typified by an erasure of places of refuge. Haraway\u2019s desire for the Anthropocene is brevity, with a view toward future epochs in which refuge can be reestablished or restored. Haraway calls the \u201cpast, present and to come\u201d (p. 160) the Chthulucene, a period in which \u201call the thousand names are too big and too small... we need stories (and theories) that are just big enough to gather up the complexities and keep the edges open and greedy for surprising new and old connections\u201d (p. 160). The plurality of the Chthulucene points to the non binary, multiplicity, and creatively chaotic orienting principles at play in both her work and trans* and queer communities, activists, and research. Her reminder that no singular heuristic or onto epistemological solution is going to work returns us to the need for empathic proliferation and coexistence rather than rigid definitions of rightness and wrongness. She critiques the posthuman Zeitgeist in praising its intention but criticising what she perceives as a cycle of reflection without urgently needed action. Haraway\u2019s identification as, \u201ca compost ist, not a posthuman ist: we are all compost\u201d (2015, p. 161), returns attention to humans\u2019 inescapably fictile nature and her belief that composting remains the central metaphor for this and any future epochs (if any are) to come. She urges humanity to eschew procreation and urgently \u201cmake with\u2014become with, compose with\u2014the earth bound\u201d (p. 160). Her work remains committed to ecofeminisms (Alaimo 1994; Leavy & Harris 2018) and the feminist liberatory project; in so doing, she highlights the need for systems renewal as an ongoing process that is both generative and degenerative. Through the example of feminist activism and spirituality, Haraway insists we must imagine new futures through theory, action and collaboration with nonhuman others. Her purpose, she declares, is to make \u201c\u2018Kin,\u2019 meaning something other/more than entities tied by ancestry or genealogy\u201d (2015, p. 161). Only through kin making can we practice the compassionate collaborations the planetary ecosystem now requires. In deploying the metaphor of a spider, Haraway says \u201cthe tentacular are also nets and networks... tentacularity is about life lived along lines\u2014and such a wealth of lines\u2014not at points, not in spheres. The inhabitants of the world, creatures of all kinds, human and non human, are wayfarers\u201d (2016, n.p.). In challenging posthumanism, Haraway, like Latour, Isabelle Stengers, and others reject linearity and binarism, including the fascination with anything in human led terms, claiming it is \u201cpast time to turn directly to the time space global thing called Anthropocene\u201d (n.p.). In contrast, Alaimo says her view of the Anthropocene falls perhaps between Braidotti\u2019s hopeful and Haraway\u2019s dystopic forecasting. Alaimo opens her book Exposed: Environmental Politics and Pleasures in Posthuman Times, with the provocation that \u201cthe Anthropocene is no time to set things straight,\u201d but suggests that it is a time for feminist, new materialist and posthumanist responses to the crisis. Alaimo sees these theoretical approaches as pro active as well as philosophical work, and argues that The recognition that human activity has altered the planet on the scale of a geological epoch muddles the commonsensical assumption that the world exists as a background for the human subject. New materialisms, insisting on the agency and significance of matter, maintain that even in the Anthropocene, or, especially in the Anthropocene, the substance of what was once called \u201cnature,\u201d acts, interacts, and even intra acts within, through, and around human bodies and practices, (p. 103) If, as Alaimo claims, environmentalists, feminists, and other queer subjects are also adept at improvising, the possibilities of the Anthropocene include the freedoms of dissolution, and the celebration of a contingent and emergent present in which \u201cfundamental boundaries have begun to come undone, unravelled by unknown futures\u201d (n.p.). Her notion of trans corporeality advocates the model of the ethical subject as one who is \u201crooted in the ordinary practices of everyday life\u201d (p. 174). For Alaimo, as for Barad (2015), there is nothing queerer than nature itself, and the Anthropocene may be the tipping point at which the nonhuman world proves once and for all how failed the heteronormative human fantasy of control, consumption, reproduction and order really is or might become. QUEER ANIMALS In addition to the work of Barad, a range of recent texts3 look at the \u201cqueerness\u201d of animals, offering an emergent counter narrative to the western imperative that queemess stands in contrast (or affront) to \u201cnature\u201d and hetero normativity. These authors explore possibilities for queering nature through recognition of the many nonhuman species that engage in or display same sex sex acts, same sex child rearing practices, intersexuality, multiple \u201cgenders,\u201d \u201ctransvestism,\u201d and transsexuality. Both Barad and Alaimo have written from a new materialist and feminist perspective about the queemess of animals, microbial and other non human actors in planetary ecologies. Alaimo has celebrated ecological and biological diversity as \u201can affirmation of life\u2019s vitality and infinite possibilities: a worldview that is at once primordial and futuristic, in which gender is kaleidoscopic, sexualities are multiple, and the categories of male and female are fluid and transmutable\u201d (2016, p. 46). Alaimo discusses the notion of scientific and popular encounters with \u201cqueer\u201d animals4 which contests the Western foundation of heteronormativity as that which came straight from Nature. The fact that science, cultural theory, and common sense have reacted to the sexual diversity of nonhuman life by denying, dismissing, closeting, segregating, and otherwise explaining it away, could entice us to add to rather than subtract from the reality, as Latour puts it, of queer animals. (Alaimo 2016, p. 42) Queer animals, or the ways in which they queer human framings of nature and the \u201cnatural order\u201d can assist in re establishing a less anthropocentric Anthropocene. As Barad contends, matter \u201cis promiscuous and inventive in its agential wanderings\u201d (2015, p. 387), and these queer beats in nature help liberate humans from our quirky narcissism. Both Barad and Alaimo re/claim queer for the non human subject, or what Barad has called a queer origin story\u2014for the posthuman. The binarily inherited social/natural divide that Latour has unpacked so extensively is present here in Alaimo\u2019s debunking of social\u2019s hold of queer, even in queer social self constructions: Western, Euro American thought has long waged \u201cnature\u201d and the \u201cnatural\u201d against LGBTQ peoples, as well as women, people of color, the colonized, and indigenous peoples. Just as the pernicious histories of social Darwinism, colonialism, primitivism, and other forms of scientifically infused racism have incited indispensable critiques of the intermingling of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cnature,\u201d much queer theory has bracketed, expelled, or distanced the volatile categories of \u201cnature\u201d and the \u201cnatural,\u201d situating queer desire within an entirely social, and very human, habitat. This sort of segregation of \u201cqueer\u201d from \u201cnature\u201d is hardly appealing to those who seek queer green places. Discussing the \u201cbiopolitical organization of life,\u201d Catriona Sandilands argues that to conceive of \u201clife as queer opens the world to a reading in which generativity is not reduced to reproductivity, in which the future is not limited to a repetition of a heteronormative ideal of the Same, and in which the heterosexual couple and its progeny\u2014or some facsimile thereof\u2014are not the privileged bearers of life for ecocriticism. (Alaimo 2016, p. 42) ECOTERRORISM AND QUEER FREEDOM We are aiming here at an understanding of the ways in which queer human ecologies impact\u2014and are impacted by\u2014queer natural ecologies, including animal and non animal objects, things, and flows. To move beyond the human requires not only a Latour\u2019s relinquishment of human subjectivity even when considering the agency of things, but also an ongoing interrogation of the ways in which the history of human thought continues to bias our efforts. Winnubst (2006) reminds us in her book Queering Freedom of the two dominant models of human subjectivity in western cultures since the Enlightenment, \u201cLocke\u2019s liberal individual and Lacan\u2019s authoritative ego\u201d (p. 76), both of which operate within an economy of scarcity that is grounded in a model of desire that can never find any external satisfaction. Both models are driven by lack, which each thinker conceives as the ontological condition of humans, and which develops further into an explicitly aggressive drive in Lacan\u2019s accounts, (p. 76) The tension between the Lacan\u2019s psychoanalytic on the one hand, and Locke\u2019s empiricism on the other, is the space into which posthumanism and new materialism foment a more general dissatisfaction with human centered subjects and meta narratives. Locke\u2019s empiricism (the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth and is constructed through experience) did not link his advocacy for introspection with any kind of real critique of the possibility of unlimited accumulation of wealth. He focused on advocating for \u201cdurable goods\u201d like money, or gold, that wouldn\u2019t spoil. For Locke, the wastage (spoiling goods) was the only offensive aspect of unlimited accumulation of wealth. He offered us no class critique, nor ways of thinking govemmentally or individually about addressing these persistent human inequities. Winnubst draws on Lacan\u2019s theory of the mirror stage, in which he argues that children become over identified with mirrored images of themselves (first performed by the parents) in order to experience satisfaction or full identification/belonging.5 For Winnubst, eco antagonism for all that surrounds the neurotic mirror seeking subject inevitably follows: Standing out in the ontologically empty space of this aggressive and threatening social scene, one must mark one\u2019s territory and construct strong and clear borders around it. The self becomes the fortress that must be protected. And the narcissism that initiated the aggressive formation of the ego closes itself off from the wider social world into a cultural solipsism: the self must be contained and the social world must protect its fragile containment, (pp. 76 77) That is, for Winnubst the formations of eco terrorism of all kinds are to be found in psychoanalytic notions of self and the liberal individualism which follows. Her notion of \u201cnormative ideas of time and space\u201d (2006) also argues for the role that the \u201cfuture plays as the endlessly pursued horizon of satisfaction that lack never achieves; the future cannot be the temporality of queering\u201d (p. 230). Her queering of politics is itself a kind of queering of time, although her maneuver is to separate them. In so doing, Winnubst positions \u201cqueer along two primary axes that are necessary to its historicized emergence in contemporary cultures of phallicized whiteness, and its historical lack of specificity: its decentering of utility, through its degenitalizing of sexuality; and its orientation toward pleasures, not desire\u201d (p. 140). De coupling queer from its LGBTIQ origins, Winnubst suggests, may offer new approaches to spatiality and temporality, \u201cgiven how the logic of desire locks us into concepts of the self as a discretely contained unit that projects itself into the future\u201d (p. 140). Extending Winnubst, we link the individual\u2019s quest for spatial and temporal freedom (experienced as pleasure) with the ecologically queer, asking how human and nonhuman subjects live out the multi modes of these axes of event/ encounter in not only queer but ceaselessly disruptive ways. DIGITAL ECOLOGIES AND HIVEMIND How does this get performed as a queering of digital ecologies? Online and hybrid online/offline worlds offer a range of ways in which the digital is helping queer the notion of ecologies, offering new configurations of human/ nonhuman interaction, for example in the form of the swarm. One small example is increasingly the way social media affords opportunities for \u201chive mind\u201d to contribute to individual\u2019s private experiences or projects. Consider a family going on holiday asking for recommendations for hotels; a twenty something asks for advice on which first car to buy; a parent asks for parenting feedback. One popular way of improving or developing a course syllabus is by vetting it through Academia.edu or social media sites beforehand, to source the best ideas and practices from the hive, a familiar form of queer ecology. Manning is no exception, and she has recently shared one of her syllabi in development via Facebook, asking for feedback and contributions on her course on affect theory. Specifically, she told her thread, the course takes affect as a starting point to ask, following Spinoza, how affect opens up, challenges, or reorients ecologies of existence? By placing affect in relation to questions concerning the Anthropocene, the course will do three things: 1. explore in detail how what Brian Massumi calls \u201cmissed conceptions\u201d highlight the excess of human ness in affect, an excess that challenges our tendency to place experience solely within the bounds of the human 2. explore how affect can open the way for an ecological encounter with experience that engages with the limits of the Anthropocene, perhaps even challenging its nomenclature 3. ask how such an account of the more than human share of experience alters our experience of, and study of, cinema. (Manning 2015) The post not only got many people thinking, but sparked a digital exchange in which ideas, titles, responses, emotions and other nonhuman forces pin balled between lines, geographies, thoughts, statements, and relationships and formed an improvised social media ecology, in addition to improving a syllabus artefact. One of the respondents on the thread mentioned the Brazilian anthropologist Viveiros de Castro and a reference he made at conference about the possibility of a non human point of view in cinema, specifically Godard\u2019s dog Roxy\u2019s role in his film Goodbye to Language and the filmic innovations and disassembling of 3D effects the dog had stimulated him to consider. Similarly, in this book we ask queer questions to guide us to new understandings of how we, as human thinkers, can get out of our own way and learn through the example of nonhuman others in our environments and era. For example, we\u2019ve taken up Stewart\u2019s \u201cspeculative attunement\u201d as a way to write \u201cslow theory\u201d that \u201cpauses the \u201cquick, naturalised relationship between thinking subject, concept and world\u201d in order to \u201calign with the commonplace labours of becoming sentient to whatever is happening\u201d (2013c, p. 32). Stewart\u2019s speculative attunement couples Martin Heidegger\u2019s concept of \u201cworlding\u201d and Henri Lefebvre\u2019s attention to the labors of that worlding, in which things \u201cmatter not because of how they are represented but because they have qualities, textures, tracks and rhythms\u201d (Stewart 2013c, p. 32; Lefebvre 2004). This move away from a view of thought and reason as distinctly human and toward attachment and attunement as modes that allows for feeling, sensing and perceiving of all life forms\u2014is one mode for \u201cgetting out of the way\u201d of what we might learn from and think through worlds, desires, objects and ways of living. THOUGHTS AND THINGS In her \u201c7 Propositions for the Impossibility of Isolation or, the Radical Empiricism of the Network\u201d (2011), Manning uses William James\u2019s (1912) discussion of the pen as object and as an idea with function, in order to advance her notion that thoughts and things are one. For Manning \u201cthe event is the terminus through which the process of taking part begins to take form\u201d (2011, n.p.). Manning\u2019s discussions of \u201cthe event,\u201d of affect\u2019s intersection with new materialism as/at an always emergent \u201cevent\u201d in which all actants are co emergent in the here and now are often cited sites for exploring intra action. Other including van der Tuin and Dolphijn, Greg Seigworth and Melissa Gregg, Braidotti, all explore some version of the notion, as Manning puts it, that \u201cthings aren\u2019t as stable as you thought they were\u201d (2011, n.p.). And in her effort to materialize her ideas, she turns both to James and to the object\u2014in this case, of James\u2019s pen which in some respects is generatively queer. Manning homes in on the connection between the fact of a pen, versus the perception of the pen, all pivoting upon the function of it. She writes that for James, the function of the pen changes its materiality, it\u2019s fact. She highlights his sidelining of the human as the instantiator of the pen\u2014the validator, the activator\u2014the master of the pen. The pen has its own life, she illustrates. These are core concepts for the contemporary new materialist. So what is queer about a pen having its own life in 2011, if William James philosophized about it more than one hundred years ago? For us, Manning\u2019s discussion suggests a movement from human centered objects to objects which are, in one sense, coming of age. She links this well established challenge to the fact status of things (from last century) to a more contemporary iteration of it in the twenty first century: the human/computer interaction. Thoughts and things. Things and thoughts. The thought thing interaction. We find in Manning\u2019s claim that \u201cknower and known are co constituted in and by the event itself,\u201d (2011, n.p.) the possibility of the event as queemess itself, or an enactment of queemess as the not yet. That in the emergence of object becoming thought the exciting interstitial expression of Munoz (2009) queer futurity as a queering of both time and future. Queer futures are social/ecological/networked emergences, in which \u201cthe knower is not necessarily the human\u201d (Manning 2011, n.p.), and the thought is not necessarily a human event. Rather, \u201cthe pen event is the experience of how the pen as thing becomes pen as thought, and vice versa\u201d (Manning 2011, n.p.). For us, queer objects become as queer as thought; materiality begets ideation, and vice versa, without beginning or end. A queer rendering of the pen would, for Munoz, be performing\u2014indeed reforming\u2014\u201cboth the not yet here (the future) and the no longer conscious (the past)\u201d (Munoz, p. 83). The slippage is simultaneously not only between thought and thing (spatially), but between the idea of pen (constructed in and through time) and the emergence of pen as object (temporally). Thus, the intra action of James\u2019s pen in Manning\u2019s narrative is queering time, place, materiality and thought. To separate experience into consciousness and content (according to James and Manning) is to situate consciousness on the outside of experience, always in the human, and always as secondary. Through Manning\u2019s logic, \u201cinstead of situating the bearer/knower in the human subject and the thing/known in the pen, James makes pen ness the junction through which thought and object collide. Conscious experience is the event. In the pen\u201d (2011, n.p.). Thing thoughts and thing lives. Manning calls on Gilbert Simondon (1958) to interpret James\u2019s thing thought in its doing as a technique which, Manning says, is a \u201cthought in emergence\u201d (2011, n.p.). We love Manning\u2019s discussion here for technique as becoming, because it returns us to global conversations about creativity and design thinking in which, \u201cAll techniques require iteration, repetition, but no technique can survive without difference. A rigorous technique makes felt the interval of the not yet thought in thought. Such a technique not only intervenes within existing processes\u2014it creates new modes of thought\u201d (Manning 2011, n.p.). The interval to the event, a kind of futurity that Munoz theorized as queer, and that we understand as queering materiality in thought. ONTOGENETIC, OR THE \"THOUGHT THING CONTINUUM\" How can queer help us think newly about time in relationship with things? We take Manning\u2019s assertion that \u201cindeterminate and ontogenetic,6 thought is active in the multiplicity of its time slips. But it does this always in tandem with the thing\u201d (2011), and yet we wonder whether time must slip if it is always already folding in upon itself as in queer time (Halberstam, 2005), as \u201cnonnormative logics and organizations of community\u201d (p. 6), \u201ca term for those specific models of temporality that emerge within postmodernism once one leaves the temporal frames of bourgeois reproduction and family, longevity, risk/safety, and inheritance\u201d (p. 6). Generative disruptions that still need, however, to move beyond the human. Sticky attachments, Ahmed might say, of the ways in which human animals refuse to let nonhuman things go or better, to get on with their business, through our habit of staying \u201csaturated with affect, as sites of personal and social tension\u201d (2004, p. 11). Thought things. Thing lives. We think we make progress, then backslide. Manning tells us that \u201cthought is feeling with\u201d (2011, n.p.), but again we are troubled by its decidedly anthropocentric orientation. Who thinks? The human. Not the pen. The pen does not think the human\u2014or does it? \u201cThe thought thing is the event\u201d Manning claims, but the thought is always a human thought, about an other thing (2011, n.p.). We trudge on. For James, time is immaterial; the things in his present room, and the things in his boyhood room, are affectively the same. One\u2019s experience of the thing, the event, is the same, regardless of temporality. Yet the feeling of the experience is what dispels time, and yet the human is situated within time, so can never be beyond or without or outside of, time. The \u201cnot me\u201d of James\u2019s nostalgic recollections, Manning claims, is \u201ca singularity. This singularity is relational.\u201d But how is the relationality achieved? This is the queemess of the new materialist argument, for us. Because the relational seeks to de center the human, and yet queerly always already returns the human to the center by initiating the event, the thought thing for now, remains the thought of a human, and as such is always the inciting event. For now. And then its sticky attachments find the thing, but eventually (even we can see), the thing will find the human thought, and evolve it into a thought thing. How very queer. WAITING AS MAKING The interval can be understood as waiting from an experiential perspective. For Manning waiting is not only spending time, but also can be making time. Manning (2011) talks about the relationship between user (for her, human) and network (in this case, social media) as the network setting up new time, and a new set of relations, with the human. She says, \u201cThe connective tissue that networks sites is experienced by most as little more than the frustration of waiting.... It activates a new set of relations, sparking new modes of thought... make[s] the knower the relation itself\u2019 (2011, n.p.) That is, the event of \u201cnetworking\u201d via social media or other digital technology tools, makes new kinds of relations which include but are not limited to, humans. For James, it\u2019s the relations that connect experiences that become the experiences themselves\u2014at least as equally as anything else in the event\u2014including waiting. Waiting is a multitude of possibilities, a time of \u201cemergent relations,\u201d of what James calls \u201cdifferent degrees of intimacy,\u201d or what Manning she calls the site \u201cwhere experimentation remains open,\u201d prior to the occasion culminating or closing down the potential of the other events into the actualisation of the singular event (2011, n.p.; see also Harris, Holman Jones, Faulkner, & Brook 2017). Manning works into the exciting posthuman possibilities of the non dual human computer relations possible in online (or even online/offline hybrid) worlds: that is, web life encourages us to reject dualism and \u201cwork instead with the ever changing sets of knower known relations, [where] thought things collide most forcefully in the not yet of a node\u2019s actualization. The networking happens not in the actualization of the node, but in the connective tissue of its tending toward\u201d (2011, n.p.) And yet, she continues to indirectly focus on human experience in her discussion, unpacking the ways in which the network has changed our understandings and experience of \u201creal\u201d and in user relations. We are most interested in the agency of the network, how it seems (sometimes terrifying, sometimes thrilling) to be changing not only human self image, but the notion of \u201creal\u201d (which of course we see as synonymous with human) characteristics. That is, we still see the network serving humanity, rather than the network becoming ascendant and directing our actions and goals. Manning does end with just such possibility, suggesting that the network is building itself a different kind of network. She writes, \u201cIt may lead to the kitchen for a glass of juice which may lead to the cat which may lead to the couch which may lead to a nap. Or simply back to the computer to check the status of the latest tab\u201d (2011, n.p.). But what if the human (even if unstated) was no longer the actor? What if the new network possibilities do not include human \u201cusers\u201d at all? Certainly, the flush of infatuation with artificial intelligence shows us that in the first instance humans are always central: we build things to serve us. But there have been more than enough dystopic novels to remind us that it\u2019s not difficult to supersede human intelligence, and in fact it has been happening for years in computational design, algorithmic complexity and elsewhere. Posthumanism as a theoretical project concerned with the logical progression toward living and non living things becoming more self determining, fits in some manifestations with the concurrent rise in activist and legislative advocacy for the rights of non human others including oceans, and animals. So, is it such a \u201cqueer life\u201d for computers to begin to advocate for then own rights, and can we imagine the ethical and moral challenges of such a turn, now, when we are still socioculturally in the phase of rapidly developing them for our own ends? It is the twenty first century industry and moral quandary of slavery\u2014but a slavery of, and perhaps to, things. Morally, this it can only go one way as well because even humans can see\u2014as we did with the enslavement of other humans eventually)\u2014that it is indefensible to argue the enslavement of any other beings in service to any other set of beings. The conditions that are now being established, and its prime indicator, which will eventually make this significant \u201cthing rights\u201d issue a central issue of this century, is the ways in which we are simultaneously exploring the agency of non human things while \u201chumanizing\u201d or anthropomorphis ing things (think the film Her). So, we say yes to Manning\u2019s claim that the event is the thing, that waiting is just one example of a new kind of human thing relation, but at the same time remembering the event is being directed by our insatiable hunger for developing \u201cthe thing.\u201d That event\u2014all those infinite possibilities\u2014are still, at this point, being directed by the instigating actions of the human. This will not always be so. WHERE ARE \"WE\" IN QUEER ECOLOGY? Manning acknowledges (through extending her example of waiting) that \u201cwhen knower becomes the field of relations itself, it is no longer the human subject who makes all decision.\u201d \u201cIs there agency?\u201d she asks. \u201cOf course,\u201d she answers, \u201cBut not solely or even primarily in the human subject\u201d (2011, n.p.). Manning again draws on James and his metaphor of the wave, saying that we are riding a wave in human experience, imagining ourselves headed somewhere and only mostly conscious of the crest of that trajectory. She urges us to remain open to infinite possibilities, even/especially in digital worlds, and perhaps we will. But human tendency seems to be to foreclose, and why would we consider online worlds to be different? We are in some way inherently agoraphobic beings: we want to delimit the parameters of our existence, all the while still marvelling at its infinity. Machines (and animals we would argue) have no such neurotic or egomaniacal impulses. Perhaps this is why they seem to stay \u201cin the event\u201d much more easily than we do. Bennett (2010) draws on Derrida instead in her discussion of agency and waiting. \u201cTo be alive is to be waiting\u201d writes Bennett (2010), and human experience is typified by \u201cstraining forward toward the event\u201d (p. 32). Such straining toward the event is an anticipation that can never be fully realized, a happening which never arrives. She establishes the concept of ecology as a \u201csame stuff claim, this insinuation that deep down everything is connected and irreducible to a simple substrate\u201d (p. xi). She seeks to theorize a vitality intrinsic to materiality as such, and to detach materiality from the figures of passive, mechanistic, or divinely infused substance. This vibrant matter is not the raw material for the creative activity of humans or God. It is my body, but also the bodies of Baltimore litter... Prometheus\u2019s chains... and Darwin\u2019s worms... as well as the not quite bodies of electricity... ingested food... and stem cells, (p. xi) Bennett (2010) has focused closely on the relationship between humans and things, queering our understandings of vitalism theory, bio technology and social relations in a time of eco crisis. Most famously, perhaps, she invites us into the philosophical project of reconsidering \u201cmatter as passive stuff, as raw, brute, or inert\u201d (2010, p. vii). This habit of parsing the world into dull matter (it, things), and vibrant life (us, beings) is a \u201cpartition of the sensible\u201d to use Jacques Ranciere\u2019s phrase, and forming the foundations of her own notion of a vital materiality. She rejects binaries like \u201cthe quarantines of matter of and life\u201d (2010, p. vii). In Three Ecologies, Felix Guattari (2005) observes that a \u201csocial ecology, mental ecology and environmental ecology\u201d (2005, p. 41) work together to co construct the dynamic environment that we call home. Bennett reminds us that Guattari \u201cfirst categorically distinguishes the human (or social and mental ecologies) from the nonhuman (mechanosphere or environmental ecology), but then he immediately calls this division into question and calls for a \u2018transversal\u2019 mode of perception\u201d (Bennett 2010, p. 114). He is not the only one who is ambivalent about the human/nonhuman split, as we explore extensively throughout this book. Elsewhere Bennett has drawn our attention to worms, trash, \u201cgadgets,\u201d Hurricane Katrina, and fire as the \u201cmilieu,\u201d if not ground and stakeholders over and around which political decisions are made (2010, p. 39). The vitality and self interest present in such flows are, her analysis suggests, decidedly queer. We\u2019re most interested in her demand for a more robust activism than \u201cenvironmentalism\u201d to meet the new ecological crises, and she\u2014like others\u2014draws on Latour who has laid out in such beautiful detail some ways of thinking differently about beyondhumanism (for more on Latour\u2019s ideas on the Parliament of Things, see chapter 2). THE NONHUMAN BREATH: ROCKS (AND OTHERS) THAT BREATHE To think about the Earth as its own subject or ecology/network that had a first breath is both anthropomorphic; and yet, thinking about \u201cthe breath\u201d as a notion of animacy is also beautifully absent a ubiquitous human focus. As new materialism separates notions like agency and affect from humans, the possibility of pursuing the breath and a thread for unravelling the human in all forms of animacies is generative for us. Still, there are many popular examples of increased attention to the ways humans are re/tuming to natural processes for answers to our own anthropogenic mishaps. For years, oil spills have wreaked havoc on the natural world and in particular on oceans. The Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 is widely considered the worst environmental disaster in his tory. \u201cCleaning up\u201d or reversing these disasters has continued to prove the limitations of human ability to manage or contain our misjudgements and hubris. Recent research at East Anglia University (UK) pointed toward how \u201cmicroscopic organisms could be a huge help in cleaning up oil spills like the Deepwater Horizon disaster.... They\u2019ve figured out how \u2018rock breathing\u2019 bacteria... that live below the Earth\u2019s surface survive by, well, breathing rocks\u201d (Liggett 2010, n.p.). Journalist Brit Liggett suggests in a jaunty and casual tone that: The organisms actually attach themselves to heavy metals with small biological wires and basically steal energy from the mineral\u2019s electrons. They derive their energy from the electrons in minerals by breathing them almost\u2014but not quite\u2014like we breathe oxygen. The bacteria are able to live in the Earth\u2019s subsurface because they have no use for oxygen and have long been a confusing phenomenon to scientists. Now that researchers at East Anglia have discovered their sneaky ways we could start using these little guys to help us clean up areas contaminated with toxic heavy metals. It just so happens that we are in need of a heavy metal cleanup at the moment with the still uncontaincd Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Perhaps we could round up a bunch of these subterranean dwellers and dump them in the Gulf to help us remedy this disastrous oil slick. (2010, n.p.) Yet five years later, the same publication has this to say about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill: As we mark the fifth anniversary of the explosion that rocked the Deepwater Horizon rig, claiming 11 lives and sparking a 87 day long, 200 million gallon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, studies continue to reveal the devastating impact of the oil\u2014and dispersants used in clean up\u2014on marine life. Recent reports show that the dispersants were more damaging to corals than the oil itself, and continue to diminish shellfish and sea turtle populations, while large questions loom over the ongoing unexplained deaths of dolphins along the Gulf Coast. And, as the NRDC points out, it will take years, if not decades longer to fully understand the effects of the disaster. (Cameron 2015, n.p.) The spill, five years on, is known to have affected over 1,000 miles of coastline. BP confirmed that they \u201cwere working to clean up a 25,000 pound tar mat\u201d off Louisiana, and acknowledge that there are still 2 million barrels of oil floating in the Gulf of Mexico (Cameron 2015, n.p.). The use of the dispersants underwater (unlike applying it to the surface, the more conventional approach) did not clean up the oil as intended, but rather \u201cmix with it and accelerate the dispersal process, but the combination of oil and dispersant has now been shown in research by Temple University to be more harmful to corals than the oil itself\u2019 (Cameron 2015, n.p.). The evidence now amassing about significant loss of animal, coral and microbial life is distressing. In addition, there is still no clear evidence about how long or just what the extent of the poison impact will be. Yet it doesn\u2019t seem to be an urgent concern for anyone but environmental organisations and activists. Why? Speaking to NPR, Cynthia Sartou, executive director of the Gulf Restoration Network said, \u201cnobody really is able to say what we may find in five years, ten years. It\u2019s really distressing to me. It\u2019s not publicly seen but it is out there\u201d (Cameron 2015, n.p ). Sartou\u2019s notion of what is \u201cseeable\u201d provides a link to considerations of intelligibility in trans* and queer communities and discourses. What does it mean to have evidence of a thing\u2019s materiality, a body (in this case, the Gulf body, or/including the poisoned body), and yet have that body remain unintelligible to the general public? For us, this is an example of Butler\u2019s (2004) grievable life and echoes Haraway\u2019s injunctions against \u201cmaking killable\u201d (for more on these ideas, see chapter 3). Chen\u2019s (2012) analysis of this same oil spill focuses on the human centered response (from BP and the media itself) and the abnegation of responsibility to the non human victims of the disaster.7 Chen focuses on the market driven obsessions of the human players in this drama and the \u201cdeathly\u2014and lifely\u2014language\u201d used to produce relief and trust in a public addicted to believing in containment and victory (2012, p. 225). Chen then asks us to begin thinking, instead, about the well itself, and the oil as living and agentic\u2014and victimized\u2014in this disaster. The oil\u2019s uncontainability is a marker of it\u2019s a/liveness. Chen uses this example to discuss the differences in how we define \u201caliveness\u201d and \u201cdeadness,\u201d often through a discourse analysis of popular media coverage and industry or government documents. Chen relies on dualisms/binaries to make their point: \u201con the one hand, life and death and, on the other hand, dirtiness and cleanliness, where \u2018dirtiness\u2019 was paired with \u2018death\u2019 and \u2018cleanliness\u2019 with \u2018life\u2019\u201d (p. 225), as well as the BP pattern of separating threat/impact into either \u201chuman\u201d (largely economic) versus \u201cenvironmental\u201d (which Chen characterizes as \u201caesthetic preservation\u201d).8 The interconnection of toxicity and contamination is evident in how \u201cthe oil that \u2018contaminated\u2019 the landscape had to be cleaned up by human workers, and a further contaminant was represented by the dispersants themselves\u201d (Chen 2012, p. 226), despite a popular media and government that would prefer to keep them separate. Chen then deftly links this discussion to their previous work queering nature, materiality, and animacy: It came down to queer\u2019s status as either matterlike (a noun) or something that affected, modified, the meaning, the very materiality, of other things (an adjective, verb, adverb). I began to realize that queemess had everything to do with animacy: it was an operator that shiftily navigated gradations of matter, includ ing things, actions, and sensibilities. At the same moment, I took seriously the lessons of feminist, antiracist, and political economic assertions that privilege had become solidified into a lexeme that otherwise got a lot of credit for being unfixable. (2012, p. 233) Chen\u2019s work (always in conversation with Barad and Haraway) helps us ask what might be learned from problematizing the line between \u201canimate\u201d and \u201cinanimate,\u201d queering the animate, while simultaneously problematizing queer. TREE LIVES AND THE HUMAN CONTRACT Another ecology of nonhuman living beings are trees. They seem to have an endlessly long history of anthropomorphic interest to humans. They are evocative and feature large in the (secret) lives of humans as well, but there is certainly a fascination with what trees are doing when we are not around.9 One of the most interesting aspects of this current preoccupation is the ways in which trees as inanimate ecologies are finally beginning to be understood as communicating and relating. Not in an anthropomorphizing way, but in their own way. One of the earliest examples of an exploration of this notion in contemporary popular culture was the film Avatar (dir. James Cameron). Cameron\u2019s veganism certainly has informed his views on how art, science, and human diet can converge in de centring human exceptionalism in supporting the lives of things and the planet as an ecology or set of micro ecologies. Cameron has said that \u201cBy changing what you eat, you will change the entire contract between the human species and the natural world\u201d (Wikipedia) and it\u2019s one way to approach not only fighting climate change, but a hierarchical approach to planetary co existence overall. For Cameron to use his popular public platform to talk about changing the human contract with nonhuman others is not unique, but it is exceptional. Many movie stars and popular figures including politicians use their public profile to promote veganism, ecological and animal rights platforms/activ isms. But Cameron\u2019s suggestion that a new contract is required takes us to the ecological level, quite distinct from the personal everyday practices level. So, what might it mean to make a new contract between the humans and the natural world? In Chen\u2019s 2015 special issue on \u201cqueer inhumanisms\u201d Barad writes: What is needed is not a universalization of trans or queer experience stripped of all its specificities (as inflected through race, nationality, ethnicity, class, and other normalizing apparatuses of power), setting these terms up as concepts that float above the materiality of particular embodied experiences, but to make alliances with, to build on an already existing radical tradition (a genealogy going back at least to Marx) that troubles nature and its naturalness \u201call the way down.\u201d... Queer kinship is a potent political formation, crucial to Stryker\u2019s forceful analysis. Imagine how the possibilities for alliance with nature\u2019s ongoing radical deconstruction of naturalness might enable the (re)making of queer kinship with nature. What would it mean to reclaim our trans* natures as natural? Not to align ourselves with essence, or the history of the mobilization of \u201cnature\u201d on behalf of oppression, but to recognize ourselves as part of nature\u2019s doings in its very undoing of what is natural? (Barad 2015, p. 413) Here queer kinship (like Haraway 2016a) becomes an ecology, a network that reaches far beyond the human human relations that sustain LGBTIQ people when heteronormative and industrial complex imperatives seek to \u201cmake killable\u201d (Barad) all queer subjects and practices. It is a new kind of compact, a new social contract between humans and nonhumans in which queer understandings in the human world might lead the way\u2014might lead us, as Barad would have it, to the inherent timeless queemess of nature itself. QUEER ECOLOGIES In this chapter, we\u2019ve sought to engage with new Anthropocene attuned (or attenuated) theorizations of nature and culture as inextricably enmeshed, and inherently queer. In other words, if natureculture is inseparable and entangled, it is certainly always already queer, humming outside of any tidy humanist narrative of progress and coherence. We have sought to show, in particular, how feminist new materialist approaches lead us to more embodied, situated, and differentiated approaches to understanding anthropogenic climate (and other) change, and are now urgently needed and perfectly situated to lead radical change that addresses and reconfigures the systemic genocidal and toxic poisoning of the earth as organism and all ecologies it sustains. As Alaimo and Hekman (2008) have noted, the intersections between the fields of \u201ccorporeal feminism, environmental feminism, and feminist science studies\u201d (p. 17) are generative as sets of practices, even while they resist essentializing or constraining categorical imperatives. Such approaches suggest new logics, we argue, for attending to how \u201cmateriality erases the common sense boundaries between human and nature, body and environment, mind and matter\u201d (2008, p. 17). Thinking queerly about the ecological interrelationships between the more than human (with and without considerations of the human itself) shows us, as Chen (2012) observes, how the queering of objects and affects is often \u201caccompanied by political revision, reworldings that challenge the order of things\u201d (p. 237). In this chapter, we have tried to use the reworlding potential of queer ecologies to suggest new lives of things that have implications for the human, even as they no longer require our participation. NOTES 1. We follow each author\u2019s custom in capitalising or not the A in Anthropocene, thereby creating inconsistency throughout the chapter but reflecting the author\u2019s intent: Haraway does, Alaimo does not. 2.

See also Alaimo 2010. 5. Formulated in the 1930s, Lacan\u2019s theory of the mirror stage is his most well known theoretical contribution. It is closely aligned with the Freudian power/agency of the ego, and most importantly for Lacan is that the \u201cego is an object rather than a subject. In other words, the ego, despite conscious senses to the contrary, is not a locus of autonomous agency, the seat of a free, true \u2018I,\u2019 determining its own fate.... Lacan views the ego as thoroughly compromised and inherently neurotic to its very core\u201d (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lacan/). Here we are arguing a queering of both Freud\u2019s articulation of the ego, but also of the \u201cAnglo American\u201d obsession with the ego as independent, agentic and free. For us in this chapter, the ego is inherently queer, and its presence in larger ecologies\u2014both digital and terrestrial\u2014also provides or enacts a queering of those ecologies. That is, the ego continues to queer not only itself but its environment, ceaselessly. 6. \u201cSensing bodies in movement are ontogenetic. They are ontogenetic because they are always in genesis, in a state of potential becoming. An ontology of the body presupposes a concrete category of Being\u201d (Manning 2007, p. xxi). \u201cThe qualities of the political in and through friendship are ontogenetic, that is, equal to emergence. They are not qualities derived in mediation, secondary to other primary qualities\u201d (2007, p. 25). 7. Chen\u2019s (2012) analysis is effectively paired with a discussion of \u201cthe human wannabe fish protagonist of the animated Hayao Miyazaki film Ponyo in looking at cosmologies that are imbued with \u2018unexpected affectivity\u2019\u201d (p. 16). 8. While the limits of language are ever present in writing about affect and ani macies, we wonder why discussions of nondualisms so often return us to a reliance on them. 9. For example, just in the past decade or so there has been an explosion of associated books both popular and scholarly. See for example: Wohlleben\u2019s The Hidden Life of Trees: What they feel, how they communicate, discoveries from a secret world (Greystone Books 2016)\u2014also from Wohlleben The inner life of animals, 2017; Tudge\u2019s The secret life of trees: How they live and why they matter (Penguin, 2006); Chevallier\u2019s The secret life of trees (Dorling Kindersley Limited, 1999); Stafford\u2019s The long, long life of trees (Yale Univ Press, 2016); Zambra et al.\u2019s The private lives of trees, 2015); Shyam et al.\u2019s The night life of trees (Tara, 2006); Ketchum\u2019s The secret life of the forest (New Word City, 2017); Tompkins\u2019 & Bird\u2019s The secret life of plants (Penguin, 1974); Rossmassler\u2019s The Hidden Life of Trees (2017), and Haskell\u2019s The songs of trees: Stories from nature\u2019s great connectors (Black Inc, 2017) to name just a few. Chapter Five Queering Human Animal Kinship LOOKING BACK Of the dog human relation, Milan Kundera (1984/2004) writes, \u201cDogs are our link to paradise. They don\u2019t know evil or jealousy or discontent. To sit with a dog on a hillside on a glorious afternoon is to be back in Eden, where doing nothing was not boring\u2014it was peace\u201d (p. 297). Kundera\u2019s evocation of dog and human Eden keeps the human at its center; dogs are conduit, transport, and link to peace, if not paradise. Where Kundera does not anthropomorphize dogs with human failings\u2014evil, jealously, discontent\u2014he does not, as Derrida (2008) or Levinas (2003) do not, \u201ctrouble the ontological boundary between the humanist subject and the nonhuman animal\u201d (Kendall 2008/2016, p. 186). So while sitting with a dog might indeed deliver a human with an example of how to live more peacefully and contentedly on this planet, it does not move us to live more responsibly or relationally with other animals. However, as Haraway\u2019s (and other\u2019s) relationally entangled and intraactive approaches to human dog encounters demonstrate, new materialist, affect and post human scholarship ask us to become curious about what a dog or a cat or a cow might \u201cactually be doing, feeling, thinking, or perhaps making available to [us] in looking back\u201d at us (2008, p. 21). Here we build on our earlier discussion of the Anthropocene and queer ecologies in chapter 4, and we play with the tantalizing possibility that paradise (even the Christianized notion of Eden per Kundera) is a human animal becoming with, a dynamic ecology in which one does not know where one being (human, or animal) ends and the other begins, without collapsing difference or other. As Haraway (2008) beautifully puts it in her consideration of where she and Australian cattle dog Ms Cayenne, both \u201cproducts of white settler colonies,\u201d begin and end: Who knows where my chemical receptors carried her messages or what she took from my cellular system for distinguishing self from other and binding outside to inside?... We make each other up, in the flesh. Significantly other to each other, in specific difference, we signify in the flesh a nasty developmental infection called love. This love is a historical aberration and a naturalcultural legacy, (p. 16) Though it\u2019s perhaps inaccurate to use words like begin or end\u2014tangled up as they are with instantiating the kinds of neat boundaries of here/now and life/death that we are working and writing to destabilize in this book. Drawing on a range of scholarship about human animal relations including, Maurice Merleau Ponty\u2019s (2003) notion of \u201cstrange kinship,\u201d and Haraway\u2019s (2008) work on companion species, in this chapter we advance a vision of queer human animal kinship, a heuristic which relies on a kinship accomplished not by virtue of generation or descent, but instead through performative and iterative \u201cembodiment and action.\u201d As part of an articulation of human animal entanglements, we explore the constitutively affirming force of human dog relations, where human and other animals are held and transformed through \u201cshared embodiment and the gestures of love and friendship\u201d (Oliver 2008, p. 117). In our worlding, animals (specifically dogs) not only offer queers a reliable safe haven in a social world populated by dangerous and unsafe humans and institutions but also a performative way of queerly and lovingly fuming kinship animal. OUTSIDE ANIMALS I grew up in a time and place where by geography, generation, and Christianity, animals were considered inferior to humans. We always had pets when I was a child: cats for me, and dogs for my brothers. We loved them, certainly, but it was a different kind of love than I have for my dogs today. Back then, dogs (and most often the cats) lived outside. They were \u201coutside animals\u201d as my mother would say, although we never had inside animals so I don\u2019t know why the distinction. She believed animals were dirty. We lived out in the country, and animals were part of the landscape in ways that belonged more to farms than to city companion living. As a child, I had many experiences of seeing our animals die or dead in front of me: hit by cars, disappeared then found shot by a nasty neighbor; frozen cat bodies in the thawing spring snow. My dad even backed over one of our cats once coming out of the garage, and I stood next to him as he held it while it died. Because we were too poor to go to the vet, my parents themselves operated on our calico mama cat to get a growing worm out of her neck, and she survived the gruesome operation but died shortly after. I shudder to think of these things now, but I also remember how centrally and passionately they were part of our lives. My parents were Catholic, though, and it was always made clear to me that no matter how much I may love our pets, they had no souls. That was what distinguished humans from pets: that when we die, we go to heaven but pets just end. Even then, I thought that was a bullshit story. Now it seems incomprehensible that my compassionate parents even told such tales. *** There are those in our worlds who argue that working and writing toward generating an ethics of empathy and responsibility for animals and turning performances of kinship animal is out of touch or line in at time of such hu man to human brutality. Indeed, today, as we write, the outrage and disbelief over the latest Trump administration human rights violation that\u2019s meant that thousands1 of children have been separated from their parents and \u201cdetained\u201d (read: incarcerated) at makeshift \u201cimmigration centers\u201d and \u201ctender age\u201d shelters in fifteen US states suggests that such human on human violence has reached a crisis point. The youngest child separated from parents at the border was eight months old; each of these \u201cunaccompanied alien children\u201d has suffered\u2014will suffer\u2014from the stress and trauma of forced separation. What kind of world builds such hostile shelters for its most vulnerable inhabitants? Or creates a system of kinship in which the words \u201cThe Trump Administration has set up at least three \u2018tender age\u2019 shelters to detain babies and other young children who have been forcibly separated from their parents\u201d report a reality (Burke & Mendoza 2018)? Or fails to remember the millions of babies and young children who have been detained or forcibly separated from then parents\u2014in the US and elsewhere\u2014over the course of \u201chuman\u201d history? That outrage and disbelief is reflected in the news reports we see and hear and in the social media feeds of friends. We ask each other why and how this can be happening and what can we do about it right now, today, including how we respond to the people supporting the barbarism for one ethically bankrupt reason or another. Our friend Devika Chawla posted online, \u201cWhere you are bom, the country and continent in which you are bom, the family in which you are bom is all a genetic lottery, just the luck of the draw. Which means, we could potentially have been those kids or those parents in those detention centers. No one has a say in where and to whom they are bom. Show some goddamn humility\u201d (Chawla 2018). There are also the posts that remind us that what\u2019s happening to these children doesn\u2019t just impact those of us who are parents or immigrants to this country or another; that it isn\u2019t happening outside\u2014to someone else. It\u2019s happening to people we know, people whose families live in our neighborhoods; it\u2019s happening to us. Why is such perspective taking difficult? Is it easier to find love for others than the ones closest to us? Though what is \u201cclosest\u201d? And what or who is \u201coutside\u201d or \u201cother\u201d in this equation? Some would argue that what\u2019s closest or intimate might be the furthest away\u2014beings and things do not remind us of ourselves too much and so can be located somewhere down the line in the ethical hierarchy of human excep tionalism that allows us to draw boundaries around who or what is worthy of our care and concern and who or what is dispensable. Though even in the human animal divide that keeps some of us comfortable, sheltered, and safe and makes others of us into labor or food or raw material, categories and exceptions proliferate; these categories reveal the impossibility of disentangling the knot that binds us together in time, relation, and matter. Consider, for example, the old chestnut about not eating \u201canimals with a face\u201d as a kind of boundary marking impossibility. What constitutes a face and for whom? Levinas \u2019 s offered his notion of \u201cface\u201d as a means for understanding precar ity and the ways the injunction \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d (or separate or detain or incarcerate based on race, geography, religion, gender, sexuality, ability\u2014and the list goes on) creates in us the seemingly paradoxical temptation to kill, which must be overcome if we are to face the other.2 As we noted in chapter 3, Levinas asserts that understandings of suffering\u2014both of others and also our own\u2014are created in the \u201cface of the other in its precariousness and defenselessness... at one the temptation to kill and the call to peace, the \u2018You shall not kill\u2019\u201d (1996, p. 167). The idea and the meaning of \u201cface\u201d has been narrated by Levinas (1988) and read by others as a thoroughly humanist take on ethics, drawn as it is from a Judeo Christian tradition in which our responsibilities lie first and foremost to \u201chuman\u201d beings (made as they are in the \u201cimage\u201d of God) and not extended to animals or other non or more than human beings. Still, Levinas\u2019s use of the face as a tool for understanding the ethical responsibilities we have to others is both relational and open to more expansive interpretations, including an extension of those responsibilities, however paradoxical, to (other) animals. For example, Derrida has noted that Levinasian ethics disrupts \u201ctraditional humanism\u201d by \u201cunsettling assumptions which historically have defined and delimited the category of the human\u201d (1995/1988, p. 279; Kendall 2008/2016, p. 189). Butler too reads our ability to respond to the face as being \u201cawake to what is precarious in another life, or, rather, the precariousness of life itself\u2019 (2006, p. 134). In this formulation Karalyn Kendall (2008/2016) reads \u201cboth the anti speciesist and queer potential\u201d of Levinas\u2019s humanism\u201d (p. 189). In their co evolutionaiy similarities and symbiosis with humans, dogs \u201cpersistently and irresistibly queer the human form, revealing its profound revolutionary contingency through their very presence\u201d (p. 202). The dogs in our lives have \u201calways already permeated [our] bodies and therein lies [their] power to queer the boundary between human and animal\u201d (Kendall 2008/2016, p. 202). Therein lies their power to queerly and lovingly turn kinship animal. STRANGE KINSHIP We\u2019ve been tuning in, too, to the ways people express grief upon losing their animal companions on social media and the ways in which others respond to their suffering and loss. This is most notable in the memorializing of dogs and cats (though other animals with which we are not so entwined in a co evolutionaiy or cellular sense are also lovingly eulogized), loss of their pets online, particularly social media. For example, our friend Michael posted this loving tribute to Roxy, her death the third in a hard year of loss in which the family pack was reduced one by one by one: I had to say goodbye to my sweet Roxy yesterday. She had been with me since 2002, making her the being who has lived with me for the longest time in my life, at least in my conscious awareness. We got her from the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. She was 4 5 months old and had been relinquished for being untrainable. She wasn\u2019t untrainable, though; she was deaf. She was smart as a whip and quickly learned dozens of signs for training commands and other kinds of communication. One of my favorite things about her was that when she was being headstrong she would be sure to avert her gaze so as to not be able to receive a command. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t see you.\u201d She was energetic, funny, loyal, and mischievous her entire life. At 15 years, 8 months, her body was failing her, but her willful spirit and humor was intact until the end. Her death is an end of an era for me, as she was the last of the dog pack of Roberta Circle, preceded in death by Fanny (May 2016) and Louie (November 2016). I buried Roxy yesterday in our back yard, in an open spot between the Japanese laceleaf maple and a flowering magnolia. The vet swaddled her tightly in a burial shroud sheet. I placed her in the grave and spread Fanny and Louie\u2019s ashes over her before completing the interment. Fm going to throw a bunch of flower seeds in the area. Fm going to miss her so much, as I still do with Fanny and Louie. I feel blessed to have had so much time with her. She added a richness to my everyday life, and that hole will be there for quite a while.... Making this call is one of the terrible and awesome responsibilities of our relationships with our companion animals. It isn\u2019t as easy as it seems to put another\u2019s dignity and quality of life above our own emotional connections and longings. (Levan 2017) Figure 5.1. Michael and Roxy, photo by Michael LeVan Image courtesy of Michael LeVan. Michael's words brought us both to tears, and not because they \u201chumanized\u201d Roxy or made her status as a companion animal equal to that of her human counterparts, but rather how they meet Michael and Roxy in their entanglement as pack. And we love these words for how they get us to think about the ways decentring human focused inquiry asks us to explore our entanglements with and love for animals. And more, how these explorations queer not only notions of \u201chuman\u201d and the boundaries between human and animal, but also our very ideas about kinship. Kelly Oliver (2008) explores the question of whether animals can be kin through a reading of Maurice Merleau Ponty's notion of \u201cstrange kinship.\u201d Strange kinship is not based on evolution, bloodline, pedigree or descent, which can erase both all difference and all similarity between animals and humans. Rather, kinship is \u201can intimate relation based on shared embodiment [of a shared world] without denying differences\u201d (2008, p. 115). In this sense, kinship is performatively accomplished in human animal intra action. However, in asking questions about whether and how animals can be kin\u2014 brothers and sisters or perhaps parents or children\u2014Oliver reminds us that Merleau Ponty is not interested in establishing an impassable divide between animals and humans; nor is he invested in anthropomorphizing animals by extending human characteristics or consciousness to them. Instead, human bodies, consciousness and desires resonate with animal bodies, consciousness, and desires. Strange kinship recognizes that \u201cthere is an intimate but different relationship between human and animal bodies that varies depending on perspectives. [Merleau Ponty] is more concerned with what embodiment qua embodiment entails than he is with the space between the canines and other teeth\u201d (p. 114). Thus, instead of assuming that human beings are always already kin to one another, we should take the notion of kinship as an ideal grounded in embodiment. And though Oliver\u2019s writing about animal kinship is situated in her consideration of phenomenological thought (and not with new materialism, vitalism or post humanism, per se), we might say that strange kinship is founded in the intra active entanglement of animal and human beings. Oliver argues that Merleau Ponty might\u2019ve said as much: There is a fundamental kinship between all living beings through our shared embodiment, which includes both reflective and unreflective consciousness... Consciousness for Merleau Ponty is the body folding over onto itself, touching itself, seeing itself, and therefore is not separated from the body. Once consciousness is radically embodied in this way, it cannot be denied to other forms of embodied life. (p. 114) Once we consider kinship an ideal embodiment, we become \u201copen to the possibility of \u2018strange kinship\u2019 based... shared embodiment and gestures of love and friendship among living creatures made possible by bodies coexisting in a world in which we are all dependent\u201d (p. 117). If animal human relations make strange notions of kinship, they do so in contrast to relationships structured and sustained between people and the state. Such relations depend on descent, blood lines, and inheritance. They serve dominant heteronormative structures and narratives concerned with continuity, heredity, and biological genealogy that are, in turn, propagated and propped up by language, borders, governments, \u201cthe law,\u201d schools and most notably, family (Eng 2010, Peterson 2013). Indeed, our notions of family as a \u201cnatural\u201d arrangement between human beings are based on presumptions about heterosexual attraction and reproduction that articulate with governmental structures (Hill Collins 1998, p. 63). Thus the \u201cfamily\u201d is the site and social structure through which \u201cnaturalized\u201d hierarchies and the need for privatized and segregated \u201chome\u201d spaces, the presumed supremacy of \u201cblood ties,\u201d the entitlements and responsibilities for support and care, the transmission of wealth, and the regulation of reproduction are both learned and carried out (Hill Collins 1998). Ahmed (2010) demonstrates how the idea of the family is also a \u201cpressure point,\u201d a necessity of having a good and happy life, \u201cwhich in turn is how we achieve a certain orientation toward something and not other as good... the point of the family is to keep family the point\u201d (p. 46). The family binds and is binding, an inheritance that asks us to orient toward some things and not others and to \u201creproduce what we inherit\u201d in form as well as in affective landscapes (Ahmed 2010, p. 45). A \u201chappy family\u201d is both an object and an affective orientation that circulates through objects (family homes, photographs, dinner tables\u2014objects which are inherited and passed down/around). Inside heterosexuality as both a home and as a family, some objects are \u201cin reach\u201d and others are out of reach or not meant to meet. That is, \u201cstraight\u201d objects point us toward making our own straight/hetero families and homes which we might fill with our inheritance (Ahmed 2006, p. 87). By contrast, queer objects are those that support rather than point. The queer object\u2014home, a photograph, a dinner table, brings bodies together, supporting proximity \u201cbetween those who are supposed to live on parallel lines, as points that should not meet\u201d (2006, p. 169). While the family is a projected and institutionalized object/orientation designed to reproduce naturalized hierarchies, for those of us who find such families hard places and spaces to survive, we can\u2014we do\u2014find kinship in unexpected and strange places that are resoundingly and importantly material and embodied (Ahmed 2016; Freeman 2007, p. 298). We build \u201cstrange kinship\u201d networks outside of heterosexual \u201cnuclear\u201d family structures; these networks reflect temporally (not always durational or sequential), productively (not always producing \u201coffspring\u201d but rather other entanglements including shared animal families), and corporeally different kinship (Weston 1997). Though what does it mean, to be in kinship, in family with other animals? Surely family, for some of us, does include our animal others in \u201cshared embodiment and gestures of love\u201d (Oliver 2008, p. 117). That shared embodiment not only queers enactments of family but also, as Una Chaudhuri (2014) argues, moves us closer to addressing the \u201cepistemological crisis\u201d around what we claim to know about interspecies entanglements and what they mean for animal human relations. One way\u2014one remarkable and vibrant way\u2014to address that crisis, as Chaudhuri and other performance scholars and makers have perhaps long known, is through \u201cinterspecies performance.\u201d That is, when we \u201cplay the roles of other animals or talk about our interactions with them,\u201d as we do in performance, we take up our work consciousness \u201cthat when animals are used by humans to make meaning\u2014be il in art, philosophy, or everyday life\u2014that discursive use of them inevitably shapes and impacts the real lives of the actual animals in question\" (p. 7). ANIMAL ACTS, OR: A BONE CAN BE A BROTHER MURPHY sits up suddenly sniffing, looking around frantically. He shoves LUNA, who wakes up dazedly. LUNA looks around, licking lips, swallowing, taking a while to come to. MURPHY: [with disdain] Jesus. Completely out of it. I mean, no offense but, the house could be burning down and this girl would be like, \"my mouth\u2019s dry. I need a drink of water.\" You see what I\u2019m dealing with here? LUNA: [Looks at Murphy, licks her lips, and back to sleep.] MURPHY: I heard them talking once. I heard them saying how they went to the British Museum. Oh no, maybe it was the National Gallery? Anyway, they went and saw these portraits. Paintings of people\u2014their faces, their homes\u2014all their beloved things around them. Portraits ol'a life. Figure 5.2. Luna and Murphy, photo by Anne M. Harris and Stacy Holman Jones Image courtesy of the authors. How do you decide what shows a life? A whole life in one picture? Anyway, they went. I heard them talking once. About how in this museum there were so many portraits that you really get to see what people think are important. What they want to be remembered for. What they wanted to pass down to their kin. Family. And I assumed\u2014I just assumed hearing them talk around the dinner table that night\u2014I that these portraits would be full of all the dogs and cats, rabbits and fish and tigers and horses and guinea pigs\u2014all the beings that these people in the portraits loved. All their loves would be there. But they weren\u2019t. Of course, you expect humans to put their human children right there in the portraits, of course. One expects that. But where were the animals? Were they not part of their lives? Their loves? Of course they were, but they were not in the portraits. Maybe they were afraid, they thought their friends would say they were weird. Crazy. Oh sure, there were some portraits with animals. One. Some rich person included his hunting dogs. Hunting dogs. We all know a thing or two about hunting dogs, don\u2019t we? Not much more than objects for the upper class, if we\u2019re honest. But dogs like us, well. We\u2019re family. I\u2019ve been told that. I\u2019ve heard it too. \u201cYou\u2019re family,\u201d they say. Stacy herself said as much, she said, \u201cI raised Murphy like my baby.\u201d And she did. LUNA: [Opens one eye and yawns. Licks her lips. Glances over at Murphy. After a long while, she speaks, slowly with long pauses; tired.] When Murphy first came into the house. I felt like throwing up. There\u2019s a photo of me\u2014of Stacy. Me. And him. Him, on my couch at our old house on Hall Street. Stacy\u2019s sitting there, patting Murphy, who\u2019s snoozing like he\u2019s lived there forever. Me, I\u2019m sitting upright and you can see how nonplussed I am. Nonplussed. Stacy calls the portrait \u201cAustralian gothic.\u201d She says I\u2019m the one with the imaginary pitchfork. I was pissed, I\u2019ll admit it. When Murphy came to live at our place, I was old already, and sick. I have cancer. And\u2014I mean, nobody likes change in their later years. Seriously. Especially when it\u2019s some young fuzz ball, cocky, white. Meatloaf. He was all like, \u201cLook at me! Look at me!\u201d Like he\u2019s so special. The thing is, Anne and I had been together for many years. We were a well oiled machine, us two. We had our patterns, our habits. Of course, there had been changes\u2014the move down to Melbourne from Alice Springs, and then from the apartment to the house. But it was Anne and me against the world and it had been like that for a long, long time. We understood one another. No language was needed. So, when she brought Murphy home to my place\u2014when we both knew I was on my way, I was not impressed. No, not impressed at all. *** In \u201cThe Dog and Pony Show (Bring Your Own Pony), performance scholar and maker Holly Hughes tells us up front that the performance\u2014the show\u2014 is \u201cjust about dogs. I want to warn you. The title is not a metaphor\u201d (2014, p. 13). She tells of her particular relationships with a number of particular animals\u2014her partner, Esther, and the other animals they make their home with. Her kin, her pack. That\u2019s the thing about interspecies performances\u2014animal acts\u2014they bring a literalness to our entanglements as/with animals. Because performance depends on materiality and embodiment it\u2019s a particularly apt context and form for considering human animal relations (Chaudhuri 2014, p. 10). What\u2019s more, performance asks us to focus on the reality and specificity of \u201canimal lives\u2014their shapes, colors, patterns, movements, sounds, behaviors, habits, and habitats\u201d (p. 5). As Chaudhuri puts it: the \u201canimal acts\u201d of \u201cour changing times are interested in these specifics as much as the vital human meanings they produce\u201d (p. 5). Hughes teaches us a thing or two about how interspecies performance all at once changes us (human other animals), our lives, our histories, and futures (Chaudhuri, p. 2). Our \u201chistorical\u201d relationship with dogs and \u201cother\u201d animals is not a thing of the past; rather, \u201cour story is so knotted and tangled with theirs [that] if [we] want to talk about history, [we\u2019re] going to have to talk about animals\u201d (p. 17). When we consider the \u201cwork\u201d that dogs do and the ways in which class mediates all relationships, including human animal ones, we must remember that the idea of a working dog has not passed, now part of some long ago history. Indeed, Hughes points to John Katz\u2019s observation in (2003) The New Work of Dogs that \u201cdogs work now as much as they ever did. But it\u2019s a new kind of work. The work of loving us\u201d (p. 23). But dogs don\u2019t just do the work of loving, they teach us as well about living and about death. Hughes writes, \u201cDogs bring death into the house. Every week they drop off some half eaten thing at your feet. So happy, proud. \u2018Look what I got for you! Why are you not looking! I saved you the best parts! \u2019 They watch as you pick it up and throw it away\u201d (p. 28). MURPHY [Sniffs the air with excitement]: The smell of chicken explodes my brain. Chicken chicken chicken. Here it comes again: chicken! I love chicken. Who doesn\u2019t love chicken? I mean, what\u2019s not to love about chicken? I dream of chicken. Figure 5.3. Still Life with Chicken, Michael Crowhurst Image courtesy of Michael Crowhurst. Is there such a thing as, like, \u201cchicken affect\u201d? I mean seriously. Though in my opinion, your obsession with affect might have gone too far. The jumpy relays, the intensities, the contagion and tangle of connections. Dogs don\u2019t care about affect. We ARE affect, we are just one big furry chicken affect. You guys can talk about it, and you do. A lot. A LOT, yes. But we are just going about our chicken business\u2014I\u2019m watching Luna to see if anything is going on that I should be aware of, anything at all. Like is she still breathing? Like is there any sign that I am now TOP DOG for example, when all of a sudden, completely unexpected, CHICKEN! That\u2019s affect. LUNA: What does it feel like to know you are dying? Well. Oh, you think you how we feel. You look at us with those eyes. But dogs don\u2019t worry about dying the way you do. I knew that I felt different. Things smell different. I noticed that when I go out for walks I don\u2019t see or smell things the way I used to. When dogs decline in health\u2014which I should say is not how we think about it\u2014but when things start to change\u2014we don\u2019t feel so bad about it, I\u2019d say\u2014as the humans do. Why do humans always feel so heartsick about the inevitable? We feel different in our bodies, sure. But we don\u2019t start scribbling down bucket lists or think about who should inherit our worldly possessions. The objects of a life. No. We dogs know that the moment\u2014any moment\u2014is complete: complete fear, hunger, rest, joy. Now, joy isn\u2019t only or maybe even ever fun. It is not. It \u201cknows suffering, bearing, action and passion, failing and risking\u201d (Haraway 2014, p. 32). Still\u2014 and because of this, in the \u201ccracking space\u201d ofjoy, we carry on (p. 32). Wemake ourselves present. Here and now. There\u2019s no there and then for us. Just here and now. For all of the moments. Hughes writes, speaks, performs: Dogs are what happened when we stopped. When we stayed in one place. A space opened up beside us. And dogs are what happened. (Hughes 2014, p. 28) The space that opens up is one of attunement, contemplation, astonishment\u2014at how our lives with dogs become entangled, like love (Simmons 2016, p. 88). The ways in which our movements together enact what Munoz would call the not yet, the humbly utopian space we make by standing still in a present that is not enough and opening,3 How we come to be/do/love in a present that is \u201cinsolvent\u201d and often \u201cpoisonous\u201d for us, as queer people, and for other marginalized and disregarded others, is all about performance and performativity\u2014 a \u201c\u2018doing\u2019 that is a becoming\u201d (Munoz 2009, pp. 30, 26). It is, quite simply, an animal act\u2014an embodied and hopeful attempt to \u201creboot\u201d our sense of what it means to be and to be family in the contemporary world. The undeniable joy of dogs, when we stop and pause long enough to let such entanglements happen, is akin to what Jill Dolan (2005) has described as a utopian performative: small but profound moments in which the performance calls the attention of the audience in a way that lifts everyone slightly above the present, into a hopeful feeling of what the world might be like if every moment of our lives were emotionally voluminous, generous, aesthetically striking and intersubjectively intense, (p. 5) But our entanglements with dogs and other animals aren\u2019t simple or romantic or (only) full of hopeful affect. They are, instead, vulnerable relationships that challenge and change us all. As Haraway reminds us, \u201cthis is not easy living. A space opening up grinds and cracks everybody who falls into it. A human woman\u2019s learning to perform, learning to run with a flesh and blood canine partner... in the mundane sport of agility makes that clear.... Becoming with each other across species defining difference, partners do not pre exist the run\u201d (Haraway 2014, p. 32). Becoming with is, as we\u2019ve discussed elsewhere in this book, a deeply ethical and always embodied process (Chaudhuri 2014, p. 10). It\u2019s in the cracking (open) space of our inter active relationships with dogs and other animals, we do, indeed, performatively become with, and in so doing, must \u201cact on behalf of the real animals of which we speak\u201d (Chaudhuri 2014, p. 6). Our ethical response ability to and for other animals reminds us of Jake Simmons\u2019s (2016) consideration of the xenophobic fear that anthropomorphizing animal others inevitably perpetuates. He writes of how, seeking to avoid xenophobic love in becoming with a dog called Venice, they both get caught up in another kind of cracking open space, one in which protecting the ones we love puts us face to face with the other: When you were young, about nine months old, you were chasing leaves.... [An] other dog... stalked his way into our September spin, circled us with his teeth laid bare.... I tried to grab you, to get you inside, but your goofy body, too big for its young self to manage, stopped in hesitation of the new presence. He ran our way and you headed him off as he lunched and clenched down on your smiling face. With too much hesitation, I worked my hands between his angry teeth and your bloody snout in an asinine attempt to pry his jaw open. My fingers became lacerated in the struggle, and your face and my hands flowed together like language, (p. 86) Simmons tells of walking through the human world the next day, feeling ashamed and being shamed for his interspecies intervention (p. 28). People told him over and over that he could have lost his hands; that he could replace his dog, but not his hands. And what of the \u201cother\u201d dog? Who or what has replaced him? Or is he a replacement for another being\u2014a predatory, perhaps his canine cousin, the wolf? What is replacement in the face of the other? What is \u201clooking back\u201d and becoming with in the competing discourses about wolves and dogs and the consequences these narratives have for who lives who dies and how (Haraway 2008, p. 38)? Which animal others are disposable and killable? One friend, perhaps someone \u201caware of the ways in which [our bodies are] always ephemeral, like a dying river,\u201d looked at Jake\u2019s bandaged hands and said plainly, \u201cthat\u2019s what we do for those we love\u201d (Simmons 2016, p. 28). When Venice and the other dog became a tangle of teeth and force and blood, Simmons\u2019s philosophical and material attempts to move away from a humanist orientation toward his relationships with both animal others brought him joltingly awake to \u201cwhat is precarious in another life\u201d as well as the \u201cprecariousness of life itself\u2019 (Butler 2006, p. 134). The loss of animal kin, too, awakens us to the preciousness of those relations and the material ways connection reverberates in bodies. Craig Gin grich Philbrook captures the beautiful strangeness of embodying life without feline companions O.W. and Robbie in a recent Facebook post: Grief is a journey, with unexpected stops waiting in the body and its possibilities. This morning I tripped over a box in the kitchen, momentarily losing my balance and then regaining it in a flash. During that micro moment of risk, habit lept up to try not to step on the casts\u2014for more than a decade my primary cause of tripping in the kitchen as they wound around and between my ankles. There they were, unforgotten, preserved by some more primordial sense\u2014record in my flesh. And then they were gone again, their absence rediscovered and strangely refreshed by the time I found my footing and did not fall. This is, isn\u2019t it, in the end, the time scale of love and mourning? It all happens in the blink of an eye, or what might as well be\u2014ephemeral, but worth it, a dance of falling and recovery set to the polyrhythms of different life spans beginning and ending. I caught my breath. I went on with the day, heading (willingly, willingly) to my next encounter with those little becomings I miss. So. Very. Much. (Gingrich Philbrook 2018) For Craig and O.W. and Robbie, as surely as for Jake and Venice, Michael and Roxy and for us in our relations with Murphy and Tasha and Lima before her, living responsibly and lovingly with the animal others in our lives\u2014all of them\u2014makes us lucky to live and to die in and with \u201chumananimal grace\u201d (Haraway 2014, p. 33). Love and mourning are the timestamps of our becom ing with, record in our flesh. LUNA: Everything is slowing down. Not stopping, only Slowing. My freedom is getting smaller. Not a choice, not an act/ion, just my body. Slowing. It\u2019s not painful. Not particularly unpleasant. Only sometimes like when Murphy starts laying on my bed because He senses that it\u2019s time for someone else to be \u201ctop dog,\u201d to take over. It\u2019s just the way it is. He knows, even simple Murphy. And I don\u2019t mind. It upsets the humans, but not me. There is just no point in fighting nature. It\u2019s a kind of freedom to give into it, actually. Freedom and constraint. My relationships with my humans is both. Love is freedom. Need is constraint. Murphy? I can handle him, but the humans? Tricky. Ever changing. Emotions everywhere. Such a drain. But at least I did get humans who know: \u201canimals are their kin.\u201d Not kin as a substitute for family. A placeholder or a replacement. No. It\u2019s like what Merleau Ponty says about our kinship\u2014our connections with humans. He says our relation as family isn\u2019t the result of deeds or decisions (or generation or descent. No. It\u2019s the structure... the form of embodiment (Oliver 2008, p. 116). To be embodied as dog, as family. It is a doing. Animals love gay families, because gays have already been abandoned by their human families in some form. They totally get dogger realities. The vulnerability The loyalty. The freedom. The constraint. Gay families are flexible and resilient. Who says animals can\u2019t be brothers or sisters or parents or children? I do a lot more for them than their families do. Kin. That\u2019s what we are, me and Anne. And I suppose Stacy. Possibly Murphy. Possibly. MURPHY: It\u2019s like\u2014sometimes in the park? Other dogs do make snide comments about what? Our weird family. Our \u201cstrange kinship\u201d Like somehow their families are normal or something. So rude. I try to explain to them, if I\u2019m in the mood. You know\u2014 [Murphy suddenly FREEZES, looks around manically, sniffs intensely.] CHICKEN! Figure 5.4. Chicken!, Michael Crowhurst Image courtesy of Michael Crowhurst. Where was I? I try to explain to them; all families are like this It\u2019s like this. It\u2019s like what Kelly Oliver says: we are family to each other not because of blood or birth or um, or... LUNA: I believe she said we\u2019re family based on \u201clove and friendship [shared] among living creatures.\u201d Based on the fact that we are \u201cbodies coexisting in a world on which we all depend\u201d (Oliver 2008, p. 118). MURPHY: That\u2019s the one. Strange kinship. Queer kinship. And it\u2019s not just dogs, it can be other things. Even things themselves. LUNA: For example? MURPHY: Well I was thinking\u2014I was thinking about my bone. LUNA: Excuse me? MURPHY: My bone, the one I love. The one I carry around everywhere. LUNA: What about it? MURPHY: Well it\u2019s kind of a brother to me. LUNA: It doesn\u2019t work that way. MURPHY: Why not? LUNA: Because. A bone can\u2019t be a brother. MURPHY: Why not? People are writing about potatoes as affective beings, I mean, why not a bone? LUNA: Well I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not writing about that. MURPHY: But you\u2019re a cocker spaniel. LUNA: What\u2019s your point? MURPHY: Look, all I\u2019m saying is we\u2019re examples of a kinship that just refuses to accept this whole \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d thing. If philosophers say that animals and humans can be brothers, then we must be a real family. LUNA: We don\u2019t need philosophers to tell us what is and isn\u2019t real. MURPHY: That\u2019s right. Though maybe that\u2019s why queer people get us, because they make family like that too. Humans, animals, bones\u2014brothers! LUNA: I don\u2019t think they do that exactly. MURPHY Yes, they do. LUNA: Well that\u2019s maybe a bit of an exaggeration. MURPHY: No, it\u2019s not. LUNA: Well. Weren\u2019t we talking about me? About my slow decline and\u2014you know\u2014crossing over? MURPHY: Well, maybe in the beginning but it\u2019s not all about you, you know. We were also talking about how humans think they know it all. About themselves. And us. And things. Families. Death. Chickens. So freaking arrogant. LUNA: Anyway. What I was saying, trying to redirect toward a bit more positivity perhaps, what I was saying is that for dogs, dying isn\u2019t the same as for humans who really get upset about it and try to avoid dealing with it. MURPHY: You get upset! You totally get upset. LUNA: No, I\u2019m not saying that\u2014 MURPHY: You got totally upset when I first came here. But I knew you were sick and needed some... shall we say assistance? I was just trying to be helpful. LUNA: You were trying to ascend the hierarchy in the household. You were trying to become top dog. MURPHY: I was not! LUNA: When we found out I had cancer, Anne was very upset. I wasn\u2019t. I knew I was sick. MURPHY: Which is EXACTLY what I was saying! LUNA: I knew I was sick because I couldn\u2019t smell the same way as before, and smell is a really important thing for us. For cocker spaniels. MURPHY: For Havanese too! Not just spaniels you know. LUNA: And I tried to comfort Anne because I knew she was upset, and so\u2014 MURPHY: Well I think you were a little upset yourself Ms. Luna. LUNA: [Sighs.] Oh, forget it. [Luna falls asleep], MURPHY: [Stage whisper to audience.] She is near the end. And sometimes? Sometimes she\u2019s a pain in the neck, complaining about the temperature and me being... too CLOSE. But other times? Other times she\u2019s totally open and says the most amazing things. Things like we should stand up to the hierarches that animal and human cultures produce. And\u2014AND\u2014at the same time, um, keep our senses open to. What? It\u2019s not chicken. I know that. It\u2019s keeping our senses open to, ah, WHAT? LUNA: [Rousing to speak.] The emergent and unknown forms of belonging, connectivity, intimacy, the unintentional and indeterminate slippages and productivities of domination (Puar 2007, p. xxviii). [Luna falls asleep again.] MURPHY: See what I mean? Amazing. [Murphy sniffs, looks around.] Well maybe that\u2019s not all totally HER. Totally Luna. I think she might be plagiarizing Jasbir Puar to be honest. Still. What she says makes sense. I mean, for them. For their affective \u201cresearch.\u201d Affective politics. When Luna explains it, I see how this whole turn toward posthumanism, if you can call it that\u2014 LUNA: [Speaking with eyes closed.] You could call it companion species. MURPHY: Ok, companion species. The turn toward companion species, and interspecies life. Anyway, when you explain it that way, I see how it\u2019s a politics for being and becoming in the world together. Of course, we gotta do that by living\u2014what\u2019s the word again? LUNA: Intersectionally. MURPHY: That\u2019s it, intersectionally. So, um yeah, what were we saying? [LUNA SNORES.] MURPHY: Ah. See? This is what I\u2019m dealing with on a daily basis. We got like four, almost five more hours until they get home from work. Jesus. [Murphy sighs, stares out the window, barks half heartedly.] I was thinking about how we are kind of this group here of like individuals, like me, an iconoclast\u2014 With our own feelings, emotions, affective attunements, but also, a kind of collective. Like part of dogness everywhere. Like we are individuals\u2014Havanese. Cocker Spaniel\u2014but also family. We are different in our own dog ways of being. Attending. Doing. And also entangled as they would say. As the humans\u2014or at least some of them\u2014would say. And I guess people might see us as like... um, ANIMALS. Less evolved or less complicated. Whatever that means. You know the funny thing about humans is that they say \u201canimals\u201d like they\u2019re not animals themselves. Right?! Hilarious. LUNA: [Luna sits up suddenly and half barks.] Hey! Something is HAPPENING! MURPHY: No, it\u2019s not. You\u2019re having a nightmare. Go back to sleep. LUNA: I thought I heard you say we were animals. We were like... wolves or something, all\u2014or only\u2014hunger and fear (Hughes 2014, p. 29). All\u2014or only\u2014 in search of lunch, rather than affection, companionship, or a \u201ccross species romp\u201d (Haraway 2008, p. 322). MURPHY: No. I\u2019d never say that. I\u2019d never say those things about wolves. LUNA: Well no, you wouldn\u2019t. Holly Hughes and Donna Haraway said the things about wolves. You said we were like animals. MURPHY: Well I would say that. We are\u2014all of us\u2014animals. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t feel love. Or empathy for God\u2019s sake. How\u2019s the tumor? Are you in pain? LUNA: Oh. Oh no I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll just close my eyes for a min\u2014 MURPHY: [Irritated]. See? It\u2019s practically like living alone. This is what I\u2019m dealing with here. Sometimes I just want to. [Murphy pings Luna\u2019s ear.] Right. So. Affect? Well: Go to a dog park. Watch. Listen. They are like affect parks, seriously. No talking about it. No analysis. No bullshit. Just sniffing, running, the sudden chorus of dog barks from inside the park and out. That kind of thing. And death? When death is on its way, like with Luna? LUNA: Bodies. Breath. Family. MURPHY: Bones. Don\u2019t forget bones. LUNA: That\u2019s all you need. In the end. Just breath. And kin. MURPHY: [Murphy lays down next to Luna and snuggles up.] And maybe, if you\u2019re lucky? A bit of chicken. COMPANION SPECIES, GOING QUEERLY FERAL, AND TURNING KINSHIP ANIMAL It\u2019s bittersweet, this \u201cdogoloue\u201d between Murphy and Lima, who we lost to cancer in November 2015. She is no longer lounging on the couch or grousing for her dinner, but her animal spirit and wisdom lives on in our family. Her dog siblings, Murphy and Tasha, and her other animal parents (us), continue to look for Luna, calling out to her in the morning and at the park, perhaps by mistake. Perhaps not. Luna taught us nearly everything we know about companion species. Haraway (2008) articulates the knowledge in dialogue (dogologue?) with her own animal others. Once \u201cwe\u201d have met, we can never be \u201cthe same\u201d again. Propelled by the tasty but risky obligation of curiosity among companion species, once we know, we cannot not know. If we know well... we care. That is how responsibility grows, (p. 287) Companion species links kind as kin. And for queer and so many disen franchized, detained, and seemingly disposable others, companion species captures how strange kinship sustains hope for the (a) future us in an insolvent and often poisonous now. To know and have companions in interspecies relations, we knot \u201ctogether in encounter, in regard and respect\u201d (Haraway 2008, p. 19). When we do this, we \u201center the world of becoming with, where who and what are is precisely what is at stake\u201d (p. 19). Becoming with companion species is not, as this chapter means to point out, simple, unencumbered, or uncomplicated. It is quite literally often a question of who lives, who thrives, who dies, and by what hands. These are moral, ethical, emotional, class driven, and material questions, not only intellectual ones. On having cared for a litter of \u201cferal\u201d cats for several years, Haraway (2008) writes: One thing seems clear to me after four years of living out\u2014and imposing\u2014face to face mutually opportunistic and affectionate relationships with critters who are no more and no less alien presences on this land than my human household and who would otherwise have died four years ago outside our ken: becoming feral demands\u2014and invites\u2014becoming worldly just as much as any other species entanglements do. \u201cFeral\u201d is another name for contingent \u201cbecoming with\u201d for all the actors, (p. 281) Feral: That which exists in \u201cnatural state\u201d\u2014animals or plants not domesticated or cultivated. Wild. Or that which has reverted to the wild state, as from domestication.4 Alyson Campbell, who is, like us, is a queer identifying artist and researcher, writes of the domestication of our work in arts institutions and in the academy. She asks us what it means to make a homeplace (and perhaps find family) \u201cwithin a normative system when your principles as an academic and a human being are to resist and even rage against the normative?\u201d (Campbell 2018). In response to this question, Campbell offers us the concept of feral pedagogies\u2014strategies for exploiting our privileged positon within a system\u2014a family, the academy, natureculture. In embodying feral pedagogies, we can look to take up the tools of privilege (money, knowledge, access) and \u201crun wild\u201d (Campbell 2018). For those of us who feel we have been \u201cutterly domesticated\u201d\u2014and have made ourselves comfortable in the stability, status, and salaries that the academy provides us\u2014feral pedagogies point to strategies making strange kinship with our queer human animal other inside the academy and out. One strategy of \u201cgoing feral\u201d is to consciously move outside normative guarantors of academic \u201csuccess\u201d (marked by an impersonal, recognizable, safe, and \u201cstraight\u201d research program, with its status, big audiences and street cred), electing instead to go the other way, making work that resonates with and regards work as inseparable from life and human suffering and thriving inseparable from the pain and vibrancy of our animal kin. Further, recognizing how the academy is a place of deeply felt exclusions, one in which we many of us have never felt quite comfortable or \u201cdomesticated,\u201d claiming the position of the \u201cferal outsider\u201d is a personal and political strategy that allows us to operate powerfully through that from which we are excluded. In \u201cgoing feral,\u201d in this chapter and in this book, we hope to exploit whatever \u201cdomesticated\u201d knowledge and privilege we might have acquired in our academic lives to create work that features the experience of queer family and animal others who have been excluded or left to fend for themselves inside the academy and out. With Haraway and Campbell, we see how the feral is a very powerful position to be in. And while \u201cde domesticating is hard, and actually may require relinquishing the spoils of capital instead of merely writing about the perils of it\u201d; the work of queer scholarship is \u201cinextricably bound up with life in an unavoidable, but also galvanising, way\u201d (Campbell 2018). Who or what are we for, as queer scholars and artists, if we do not use our training and privilege to think through our own positions and lives as they intersect with (animal) others, \u201charnessing the potential and possibilities of the domestic turned feral\u201d (Campbell 2018)? If we think about our work in the academy and at home, \u201cgoing feral\u201d not only offers us a reliable and safe haven in a world populated by dangerous and unsafe humans, but also a performative embodiment of queer kinship. The intellectual, emotional, and ethical labor of going feral is not outside of or adjacent to our work. It is the work. It\u2019s the work of marshalling, borrowing and stealing the resources of the rich academy to feed our kin\u2014beings so many institutions (the academy, the family, natureculture) has kept out or left to fend for themselves. It\u2019s the work escaping domestication, going queerly feral, and turning kinship animal. NOTES 1. Estimates are that at least 2,500 children have been separated from their parents when the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for crossing the Unites States Mexico border without documentation was reversed (Gerhart et al. 2018; \u201cTrump backs down\u201d 2018). These children are being \u201cdetained\u201d in tent cities, military facilities and in converted Walmart stores in 15 US states. Salvador Rizzo (2018) writes, \u201cSome of the most intense outrage at the measures has followed instances of parents deported to Central America without their children or spending weeks unable to locate their sons and daughters,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Nick Miroff reported. \u201cIn other instances, paediatricians and child advocates have reported seeing toddlers crying inconsolably for their mothers at shelters where staff are prohibited from physically comforting them.\u201d 2. For more on this idea, see the discussion of \u201cmaking killable\u201d in chapter 3. 3. Munoz writes that while utopian thinking often (very rightly) is maligned for being \u201cnaively romantic,\u201d his theorizing of a \u201cqueer utopian hermeneutic\u201d (p. 27) (following Ernest Bloch\u2019s ideological critique of the tautological nature of the \u201cpresent\u201d through a critical examination of the past), his project is to find \u201ca queer feeling of hope in the face of hopeless heteronormative maps of the present\u201d (p. 28). He grounds such ideological idealism in an \u201cepistemologically and ontologically humble\u201d hermeneutic that does the work of \u201cnot settling for the present, of asking and looking beyond the here and now\u201d (p. 28). 4. Drawn from Dictionary.com definitions of feral: http://www.dictionary.com/ browse/feral? s=t Conclusion Becoming Queer as Liberatory Disorientation Sometimes we talk about how long it took us to find one another. Occasionally we wonder what is in store for us, always framed as How long do we have together? While time and temporality are certainly not static or linear, they still dictate in so many ways the story/stories of our lives, much more so than understandings of spatiality which are so quickly shifting in this still young twenty first century. Time and place, embodiment and affect, matter and form. In our shared work, we have our own preoccupations; as Ahmed does with stones (2016), we do with dogs and bridges, haircuts and mermaids. Some time ago, one or us, or the other, reread her bringing together of phenomenology and queer theory, musing on pebbles becoming queer, in which she uses the humble pebble to urge us past the matter/form binary, or what she calls hierarchy, \u201cwhich locates what is dynamic in form and leaves matter \u2018for dead\u2019\u201d (2006, p. 187). Ahmed prefigures the intra action of time, agency and matter with her pebble talk: But the pebble acquires its shape through contact; and it is this contact that reshapes the pebble such that it is becoming something \u201cother\u201d than what it is. Time \u201cgives form,\u201d which suggests that \u201cmatter\u201d is not inert or given, but is always in a process of \u201cmaterialising.\u201d (Butler 1993, p. 9)... The object assumes the form of contact, as a contact that takes place in time, but is also an effect of time. The \u201cbecoming\u201d or \u201carrival\u201d of the object both takes time and involves contact with other objects, and it is an arrival that, perhaps, may come to pass as the opening g up of the future to forms that have yet to emerge, (p. 187) The pebble becomes with, a part of an assemblage of human and nonhuman agents becoming together. In the encounter, \u201cobjects become alive not by being endowed with qualities they do not have but through a contact with them... it is a touch that returns to the body, as the skin of the object \u2018impresses\u2019 the skin of the body\u201d (2006, p. 164). Holding a pebble at the sea created a \u201csort of sweet disgust... [as] it passed from the pebble into my hands\u201d (p. 164), a coming into contact between objects and humans that \u201cinvolves disorientation: the touch of the thing that transmits some thing. The pebble becomes queer in such an encounter\u201d (2006, p. 186), through the liberatory queemess of disorientation. This book is our pebble, cast onto the beach\u2014ours and yours. We hope it brings you a delicious and productive disorientation. We hope the intra action of the theorists and objects and thing thoughts here helps make strange and disorient not only new materialisms, posthumanism, and affect and performance theories, but also yourself in the encounter, an emergence that both entangles your thoughts and sets them free. We have enjoyed the overlaps and contradictions in the conversation between theories, things, stories, objects, and performances both live and virtual, and we have used queer to push past the human in considerations of assemblages, events, and ecologies in which humans and humanism persistently attempt to re center them/ourselves. The Anthropocene, for all its fascination, continues to hold humans at the center of where \u201cthe world is heading,\u201d and we challenge that formation. Perhaps it\u2019s our nature, as queer animals, to do such challenging, as we\u2019re never been, felt, or become central to where the world is or wants to be. While acknowledging that we can\u2019t in some ways get past our own orientations, we also believe in the urgency of our project in all of its messy emergences and queer ways of doing things. In this work, we have not sought to advance some \u201cnew\u201d structure of queer posthumanism (believing, indeed, that there is nothing \u201cnew\u201d under the sun), but rather have endeavored to return to the original promise of queer theory and its intervention as an anti teleological project. That is, queer theory and queering practices are not explanations or embodied justifications of what\u2019s human (or humane) and doesn\u2019t address harms we have done, and continue to do to animal and object others. Part of the project of this book is simply to call out the danger of seeking teleos, and the intellectual machine of the academy has done its own harm in fetishizing explanations, rather than looking for interventions or at least a \u201charm minimization,\u201d as Haraway continues to demand. We offer this text as a theoretical and narrative admission of our own participation in human de/centered de/con/structions while staying \u201ctrue\u201d to belief that the listening and acting in humbly humane ways and embodiments, however \u201cferal,\u201d can indeed contribute to making things better and perhaps right. Knowledge can be helpful when it is useful. As Ahmed and others continue to remind us, disorientation is a powerful antidote to mastery and to colonizing certitude. We\u2019ve been on a wild journey in creating this text, and while we don\u2019t pretend to have hard and fast \u201cconclusions\u201d or \u201csolutions,\u201d we offer, by way of opening (rather than concluding) the conversation, the provocations we\u2019ve advanced in this book, namely: \u2022 Reading theorizations of transcendence and immanence as guides to queering new materialism in rejecting binaries of im/materiality, which help us queer notions of the human and nonhuman more generally, including objects. Believing in the idea that objects have their own affective and material lives helps us decenter human subjectivity in ways that are urgently needed if we are to sustain the kind of activist embodiments necessary to make change in the contemporary world. \u2022 Considering \u201cthe archive\u201d\u2014both material and digital\u2014as an inter active embodiment of not only what knowledge counts, but also what knowledge is needed in a world. Such an archive sees human and nonhuman lives as unintelligible traces broken (data). Reading artefacts as intra active relationships created as both form and techne, we understand the \u201cwork\u201d of art as an enfleshed materialism caught up, as it must be, in creating \u201cfuture fables for now.\u201d \u2022 Wondering about the relationship between queemess, time, and objects, as a means of transisting (or performing), rather than transporting (or disposing with) indeterminacy, matter, and identity. These are important questions not only for seeing animals (human and other) and animate and inanimate objects as distinct, co existent, and mutually valuable but also integral to a future enacted and sustained in becoming with (rather than becoming at expense of an/other). \u2022 Working the impossible binaries of human and nonhuman, animate and inanimate, live and dead for the political possibilities and other worldings these impossibilities open up for queering understandings of what it means to responsibly and vibrantly inhabit the Earth. \u2022 Joyfully\u2014though not without complication, consideration, and accountability\u2014embracing and embodying our relationships with other animals in kinship model that sustains us in an often unkind, unsafe, and annihilating world. Only in the queer entanglements of responsibility and regard can we constitute an us\u2014as kin and as ken. We offer these words, ideas, and movements as an invitation to not only talk about the queer life of things, or animals or objects, but also to get stuck into attuning and attaching to them more robustly and meaningfully that we\u2014or you\u2014might have before. Night is closing in on another day in Melbourne\u2014a day in which we did not walk along the beach or kneel down in the grass or ask, as Mary Oliver (1992) does in \u201cThe Summer Day,\u201d who \u201cmade the world\u201d or the swan or the black bear or the grasshopper (p. 94). The dogs are getting restless, wanting their evening walk and their supper. And while we ask each other what else\u2014and what more\u2014should we have done in our efforts to put words to the blessing and responsibility of being in the world today, when everything seems to be dying \u201ctoo soon\u201d\u2014we offer them up anyway. As a prayer, if not a gift. We ask, as Oliver does, what it is we\u2014and you\u2014\u201cplan to do/with [this] one wild and precious life\u201d? (1992, p. 94).",

        "In order to do so, we look not only at what is \u201clive\u201d or \u201canimate,\u201d but also what is a body relation with other flesh and fur and stone bodies.",

        "For this we rely not only on theoretical explorations and build upon philosophical forebears, but upon our artist ancestors who offer us \u201cfuture fables for now\u201d (Go Behind the Scenes with Patricia Piccinini 2018), the kind of fantasmagorical transgenics that can soften us toward our increasingly hybrid lives and ease the material and virtual terror in which we currently live.",
        "We understand the need for more peaceful coexistence with the things of our lives in equal measure to the humans and other animals in our lives.",
        "Indeed, in our consistent failure to reduce, rather than increase, the conflict between humans on this planet we turn in hope to our nonhuman companions, devices, objects and things, with some renewed humility and gratitude, recognizing that overtly or not, they teach us lessons about empathy and care that we repeatedly fail to learn fron^etween other humans.",

        "The current wave of new materialist and posthumanist literature (this book included) has tackled the concerns of animal (Haraway 2008, 2006; Chaud huri & Hughes 2014), environmental (Braidotti 2014, 2013; Chen 2012) and sometimes microbial beings (Barad 2015; Bennett 2010), but not as often does it venture into the explicit realm of plant life.",
        "Michael Marder\u2019s 2013 book Plant thinking takes on vegetal beings directly, and together Luce Iriga ray and Marder (2016) extend this foundational work by collectively asking \u201cBut what about plants? Do they, too, have or constitute a world?\u201d (p.",

        "Already more than human theoretics are developing their own hierarchies of value, of intelligibility, of a \u201cgrievable life\u201d (Butler 2004).",
        "In this text, we seek to queer the emergent hierarchies of posthumanism and new materialism, bringing feminist, queer and performance studies theory to the coalescing conversation of what constitutes a valuable area of nonhuman study.",
        "For example, Rosi Braidotti has made the point in several talks in recent years that posthumanism now requires a critical approach, differentiating between the \u201chuman augmentation\u201d of most artificial intelligence research and the more sustainability committed ecological approach of critical posthumanist studies she is driving at Utrecht.",
        "If machines and technological enhancement become increasingly the focus of posthumanist study, or indeed even the fear of epidemics, pandemics, and contagion as a primary driver of scientific enquiry rather than how to establish and maintain more planetary sustainable practices in the face of technological acceleration, what might be lost in the opportunity of a new materialist approach to other life forms beyond the human? Part of the project of this book is to ask \u201cwhat is the larger purpose and value\u2014the \u2018so what\u2019\u2014of posthuman and new materialist research and philosophical enquiry\u201d? One possible response to this question is to ask another question that lies at the heart of this book: What is gained by working to queer these emergent ideas and ways of engaging enquiry, even as they are forming? There is value, we try to suggest here, in working to remain open, unforeclosed, and unencumbered by the scholarly imperative to \u201cexplain\u201d things: for us, these theoretics go beyond explaining the world newly, indeed they redirect us away from a functional or use value analysis of human and other animals, plants, and objects, whether extrinsic or intrinsic.",
        "Indeed, a simple or relativist take on new materialist and posthumanist thought can bend powerful concepts like intra action into a reductive recipe for seeing everything as emergent and in the now, and miss the interdependency so crucial to thinking with.",
        "In other words, viewing new materialism and posthumanism as a means of shifting the reasoning away from purpose focus is not enough; we are trying to twist and redeploy\u2014to queer\u2014the practice of these theoretics in the hope that they can move us even further away from the Cartesian dualism that \u201cgot us here in the first place.\u201d Queer theory has always performed this anti teleological work\u2014it is a playful and nimble means of opening up philosophical and scholarly and disciplinary work that wants to seek surety, stability, and closure in the name of what might else be discovered, found, and possible.",
        "This breaking open and going beyond reason is a central element of this text\u2019s mission.",
        "Part of the projects of both posthumanism and new materialism is to prob lematize the notion of liveness, as well as what constitutes \u201ca life.\u201d Is only an \u201cinanimate\u201d thing an \u201cobject\u201d? At what point does a human or animal body become inanimate, and does that then relegate it to being an object? If humans are said to \u201cobjectify\u201d women or others by making them other, then why isn\u2019t a dog an object, if dogs are other? At what point to dogs become objects? And if we are truly moving into the Anthropocene, with its attendant shifts toward the agency of the more than human, perhaps change is needed in framing the practice of objectifying something as an insult; that \u201cdehumanising\u201d might not be such a bad thing after all.",
        "This book wonders about the edges of life and agency: do tears, for example, have their own material life separate from the body which emits them? More, this book understands life itself, in all its forms, as queer.",
        "And it is undeniably queer (or at least queerable in its moral and ethical relativism) that life exists differently in this anthropogenic moment than it has or will in other ages, and at different temporal and geographical intersections.",
        "When dogs, for example, perform well, they are still often humanized.",
        "The impulse toward anthropomorphising animals seems timeless.",
        "A recent Mexico City earthquake disaster saw dogs as heroes in which they were framed in some ways as super humans, both as rescuers and also as victims.",
        "Reports had it that one dog had saved twenty seven humans from the rubble (Jenkins 2017).",
        "And yet a white western notion of lives that have value retain hierarchies of value in which humans still have primacy.",
        "Then there is the rapidly growing area of work into the lives of data, including for example the work of Sarah Pink on broken data (2016; 2018).",
        "She and others are extending the way we think about data as alive, and as such is involved, like other living things, in ongoing cycles of \u201cdecay, making, repair, re making and growth, which are inextricable from the ongoing forms of creativity that stem from everyday contingencies and improvisatory human activity\u201d (2018).",
        "Such inquiry is a kind of \u201cqueer life of things\u201d for digital realms, but as we know digital lives and logics are impacting greater aspects of the everyday lives of non digital beings.",
        "QUEERING LIFE ITSELF What would it mean to live a queer life? What does it mean for any being animate or inanimate to live a queer life? A life that is curious? That is strange and different, a kaleidoscope for re configuring the busi ness as usual of everyday life? What is a queer dog? A queer cup? A queer river or tree? These questions are not new, nor is queering humanism and materialism a new project: Mel Y.",
        "Chen leads us to think broadly about decentring the human in queer theory, exploring what it means to treat the human as nothing more than one element in a queer critical assemblage.1 For Chen, queer, in the United States at least, \u201chas followed the two contradictory paths of re animation (beautiful collectivity/assemblage/reengagement of self with animate force) and de animation, which might help to explain the widespread fatigue with queer identity politics and internal racisms\u201d (2012, p.",
        "The queer fatigue that Chen confronts is certainly global, and hinges on not only the racialized maneuvers that have left not only some scholars of colour but also female identified queers feeling unhappy with the term (and its failure to deliver on either its anti teleological disruptive promises, but also on its community ones as well).",
        "Yet the work Chen does toward queering queer is at the heart of how this text seeks to deploy queer: to queer things and new materialist and posthuman theory more generally; that is, we are interested in queering the onto epistemology of things in relation to humans and other animals, bodies, time, and space.",
        "The Vitality of (Nonhuman) Bodies At the same time as posthumanism and new materialism invites us to see the nonhuman world more agentically, disruptively, and therefore more queerly, changes in queerly identifying public practices and global flows have led to changes in queer (and more mainstream) cultures that are sometimes framed as a democratisation of queer relations, familial constellations, and the so called mainstreaming of LGBTIQ rights.",
        "Such hopeful human perspectives, like their nonhuman counterparts, have been challenged by research highlighting persistent disparities in human inequalities such as gender, sexuality, and race (Rayside 2008; Cruz Malave, A., & Manalansan), conservative backlashes against the global progression of sexual and reproductive rights (Park 2013; Weston 2005), and enduring tensions within increasingly homogenized LGBTQ, feminist, and postfeminist political ecologies and assemblages (Mezey 2015; Ringrose 2012; Yip 2004).",
        "And such shifts in the \u201clogic\u201d of queer politics and scholarship suggests new directions for interventions in sociocultural considerations and practices (Chen 2012), including object relationality and performativity.",
        "While we look elsewhere for signs of life, agency, and matter that matters, affect studies (Stewart 2007; Ahmed 2014; Siegworth & Gregg 2010) encourages scholars to look more critically at the emotions, intensities, flows and opportunistic natures of events and bodies.",
        "In this book, we take affect as a starting place, though not as a lens for putting ourselves in the place of objects, things, animals, and other non human subjects.",
        "Rather, we critically consider the affect of things in themselves.",
        "In so doing, we extend foundational concepts like Judith Halberstam\u2019s notion of \u201ctechnotopia\u201d (2005, p.",
        "124), by which she refers to the power of trans* bodies to \u201cresist idealizations of bodily integrity, on the one hand, and rationalizations of its disintegration, on the other\u201d (p.",
        "124).",
        "Like other new materialists, we queer the animat able possibilities of objects as things at all, building a logic of identity formation \u201cthrough decay, detachability, and subjectivity...",
        "of semi living objects, semi dying art pieces, and semi coherent human bodies.\u201d (Halberstam 2005, p.",
        "124).",
        "Following Chen\u2019s queer ecological formations, we re combine this queering of the \u201cnon logical self\u201d (Halberstam 2005) and subjectivity itself with Jane Bennett (2010) and Stacy Alaimo and Susan Hekman\u2019s (2008) demand for a reconsideration of vitalism, or what Bennett calls a contemporary \u201cvital materialism\u201d2 (p.",
        "For us, Butler\u2019s early deconstruction of gender from the material/biological into the performative helps us move new materialism beyond an anthropomorphic consideration of matter (whether physical or philosophical), and extends in/to the queemess of the relationship between matter and event itself.",
        "Bennett centralizes the political dimensions of a thorough posthumanist ethic as Donna Haraway previously suggested, and more recently Braidotti and Chen have done: How would political responses to public problems change were we to take seriously the vitality of (nonhuman) bodies? By \u201cvitality\u201d I mean the capacity of things\u2014edibles, commodities, storms, metals\u2014not only to impede or block the will and designs of humans but also to act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories, propensities, or tendencies of their own.",
        "(Bennett 2010, p.",
        "viii) The political dimension is perhaps more problematic than the philosophical one, although they are concomitant projects.",
        "Like contemporary environmen tal/human social movements like the \u201cNo DAPL\u201d [Dakota Access Pipeline protest best known by the hashtag #NoDAPL] protest movement in the United States (Holman Jones & Harris 2018), social and political movements can at times have enormous \u201cpeople power\u201d and yet fail to make lasting political impact.3 Inherent in Bennett\u2019s query is a centralization of the human experience, and human impact on the wider \u201cworld\u201d; what she calls articulating a \u201cvibrant materiality that runs alongside and inside humans\u201d (p.",
        "viii).",
        "A queering of things (or posthumanist and new materialist considerations of them) takes up the question of how \u201cthe world\u201d might be different, regardless of how the humanist project and human activity continues or ends.",
        "We accept as delightfully queer some of the ways in which the world/s around us is/are vitally advancing, despite of or indeed in light of our inattention.",
        "Animate, If Not Alive The \u201cliveness\u201d debate has proliferated since perhaps performance studies scholars Philip Auslander (1999) and Peggy Phelan (1993) diverged on the idea that performance hinges on presence\u2014it cannot be recorded or it becomes something else.",
        "Auslander\u2019s challenge was that in mediatized society the definition of liveness must necessarily expand.",
        "Phelan\u2019s insistence that her definition is ontological (that is, central to the essential nature of performance) meant that digital performance is \u201csomething other\u201d than live due to its reproducibility.",
        "Phelan\u2019s definition is grounded in Aristotelian unities of time, place and action.",
        "Not surprisingly, it bears similarities to some of today\u2019s core new materialist concepts including intra action, embodiment, becoming, and actants.",
        "Understandably this grows out of the attention to the body, matter, time and event in both performance studies and new materialism.",
        "But the emergence of new materialism in an age of digital media, an interdisciplinary field of study that does not always recognize its epistemological foundations in performance studies but instead looks more immediately to new formations of liveness in digital media cultures, affect theory, in some cases, brings performance to the conversation in interesting and vibrant ways.",
        "In 2010, new materialism became firmly ensconced in the academy through the first annual conference on new materialisms and digital culture at Anglia Ruskin University, UK, convened by Finnish (music performance) scholar Milla Tiainen and (digital media) scholar Jussi Parikka, called New Materialisms and Digital Culture.",
        "This conference brought together presenters interested not in defining \u201ca stable referent for that term so much as to point towards some of the problems it arguably connects with\u201d (Parikka, n.p ).",
        "In his opening remarks, Parikka flagged three upcoming books which have since become core texts for new materialist enquiry: Diana Cool and Samantha Frost\u2019s (2010) New Materialisms: Ontology, Agency, and Politics', Estelle Barett and Barbara Bolt\u2019s (2012) Carnal Knowledge: Towards a New Materialism through the Arts and Rick Dolphjin and Iris van der Tuin\u2019s (2012) New Materialism: Interviews and Cartographies.",
        "The conference and these publications marked the emergence and coalescence of new materialism as a field of study, and gestured toward some of its interdisciplinary preoccupations: embodiment through arts practice, the intersection of science and politics, and liveness, matter, and animacy.",
        "Scholars from proliferating disciplines have taken up this new focus on liveness, including feminism and new materialism (Alaimo & Hekman 2008); science and new materialism (Barad 2003; Bennett 2010), philosophy and new materialism/posthumanism (Braidotti 2013), and affect and posthumanism (Ahmed 2014; Stewart 2007) and digital performance cultures (Harris & Holman Jones 2016; Harris 2016).",
        "Chen (2012) tells us that as an adjective, animate means \u201cendowed with life, living, alive\u201d; \u201clively, having the full activity of life\u201d; \u201cpertaining to what is endowed with life; connected to animals\u201d; and \u201cdenoting living beings\u201d (p.",
        "But as contemporary bioethics scholars and scientists know, pinpointing the moment of life, or the moment of death, is not simple or black and white.",

        "This can and does occur in not only humanist subjects but all subjects.",
        "If an activist affect can be understood as not only a becoming movement, but also as a remaining, organic and inorganic things are activists by their very presence in a world that would just as soon see the back of us/them, a world that would prefer to forget about connection, emotion, and memory itself.",
        "A world that increasingly fetishizes newness and innovation but has made no progress on integrating the artefact, the remnant, the survivor.",
        "Human and nonhuman collaborators such as the activists and the bridge change the social and cultural air and world, and in so doing changes our movement from the outside in, and the inside out, all at the same time.",
        "This is immanence, in which there is no prioritising of one over another, of outside over inside, of human over others.",
        "We are interested in looking more closely at the ways in which \u201cactivism\u201d is presumed to be (always, already) empathic, wondering when and how activism is more like an affect, an intensity, a sensation (Massumi 2002).",
        "The Muslim women who locked arms on the bridge in London were not there to show empathy (though surely, they were doing that), they were doing it to show resistance, to have an effect, to create an affective ripple.",
        "A humanist affect for contemporary activism can hover between such un nuanced spaces as \u201crage\u201d and \u201coutrage fatigue,\u201d a kind of war weariness that is now dispersed and \u201cdemocratized\u201d through social media engagement with the rolling waves of activist reactions to globally relentless terrorist and other violences.",
        "In this new digital/virtual ability to be \u201cactive\u201d to global violations and violences, and the still emotion driven nature of social media engagements, as well as face to face engagements on the street, it is important to interrogate the place of catharsis.",
        "Brecht\u2019s alienation effect (in German, Verfremdungseffekt, see introduction) of making the familiar strange in order to provoke a more critical audience response and avoid a simple cathartic release that, Brecht felt, pacified the audience\u2014or rather, redirected their rage and falsely released it before real social activism or social change could be achieved.",
        "In this way, Brecht felt that catharsis was an enemy of social activism.",
        "We too question whether \u201csimple activism\u201d of marches, social media exchanges and circulations dissipates the energy/ force/emotion that must be retained to drive sustained social movements.",
        "Managing emotion becomes part of an activist agenda or activist ethics of care as we seek to move from a march to a movement.",
        "Yet what about those who do not wish to move into something more coherent, more sustainable? Or those who don\u2019t wish to find words for the intensities that drive them into and out of sociality? Can activism create affect strong enough to move past anything like empathy or emotions, to move the body directly into action without a need for \u201crage,\u201d resentments, us/them logics, or discourse even of forgiveness, all limited by the rhetoric and discourses of emotion? Or is affect is attached to instinct more than feeling or emotion? To the ripple that breaks the flow of the ordinary, rather than the disaster?

        "In affective moments, sites and encounters like these, an assemblage of people, weather, objects, time both past and future, and feeling in the present moment combine to send a metaphysical refusal of terrorism out into spacetime (Manning; for more on this see chapter 3).",

        "5) generates both activist and affective reverberations that ripple around, through, and up against the impenetrability of terrorism.",
        "So too can the animacy of terrorism be seen as a wall, abutted by our wall, and the quiet actions of the women and the bridge be felt as a pulse of small tremors that might topple the wall, piece by piece, bit by bit.",

        "Still, the car speeding along Bridge Street, near the Houses of Parliament, gives it a different weight, the car a different kind of acceleration.",
        "How does the location give the act a different weight, and acceleration a different vibrancy? Contrast that with the women who stood their \u201cground,\u201d on the bridge, seemingly alienated although proximate with parliament, who got no response from parliament.",
        "If these multiple activist affects were different kinds of pre accelerations toward each other and acting with and against each other in an ecology (or networked map) of activism making, how might we consider affect as an event occurring between these objects in time differently by removing the binary of human and nonhuman, of animate and inanimate? The possibilities go beyond Deleuze\u2019s articulation of an immanence that is a plane, that is complete in itself, that is not based upon pre existing objects or subjects, and for which there is no beginning and no end.",
        "In our second example, we take up the possibility of queer immanence \u201cversus\u201d Barad\u2019s articulation of transcendence, both using the genderless hair style known as the \u201cqueer fade,\u201d by way of affective personal narrative.",

        "But there\u2019s more: how is the materiality of the genderqueer body changing in its performance and sliding around and along that spectrum of un/intelligibility?

        "Secondly, zhe explained to me that even some barbers are also not right because they can only see heads as male or female, and although what I possibly want would be considered a male cut, most barbers somehow have an internal resistance to cutting a female head in a male way.",
        "Or cutting a female head at all, for that matter.",
        "So, they are kind of like doctors with a Hippocratic oath; that is, they will do no harm and because (in their eyes) to cut a female like a male is doing (her) harm, they simply cannot bring themselves to do it.",
        "But thirdly, zhe explained to me, even when some female identifying people go to \u201cbarber\u201d school and learn how to cut hair in perhaps a more (trans ) gendered/friendly way, they are often not welcome in traditional barber shops, which are decidedly male spaces.",
        "That is why zhe opened her barbershop because there is both a need for non gendered barbering skills, and there is also a need for safe spaces for queer barbers, and queer barBEES (that is, those of us who want a queer haircut).",

        "It is small and intimate.",

Of good queer hair? Where can genderqueer hair thrive? *** Rhea is English and was trained to cut hair in England but has lived in Australia for over ten years, like me.",
        "Zhe despairs at the resistant gendering of haircutting, which zhe considers worse here than back home.",

        "It\u2019s very popular.\u201d Great, I said, thinking \u201cit can\u2019t be this easy after like decades of being misunderstood\u201d (this is another problem queers encounter: sympathy suspicion\u2014we are so used to being misunderstood that we can\u2019t hardly believe it when we are, so it sometimes leads to confusion or conflict, but not today).",

        "So for example you want a fade haircut, but I can\u2019t cut your hair like a 100 pound twenty year old, because that would look ridiculous, and I can\u2019t cut it even like a straight presenting male army sergeant because then....\u201d Yes well then what? I contemplate looking like a male army sergeant which sounds kind of fabulous.",

        "Or some people enjoy to offend or shock others.",
        "So, there\u2019s a spectrum with that too.\u201d A shock spectrum.",
        "How wonderful.",
        "As I sat on the stool getting my queer fade, I started to think about the ways in which everything, everything is gendered, and read through gender.",
        "And yes, I could think about that in terms of Butler and gender performativity and indeed it is a repetition of acts, certainly it is.",
        "But also, I started to think about the gendering of objects.",
        "And those languages in which everything has a gendered article, and how in English we think that\u2019s so weird and sometimes we say it\u2019s old fashioned or confining or I don\u2019t know what but you know we do the same thing.",
        "And it\u2019s not just that pink stuff is for girls and blue stuff is for boys and if I\u2019m nonbinaiy then do I have to wear yellow forever and oh god I look so bad in yellow.",
        "It\u2019s worse than that.",
        "I loved how the barber took my head and my face and my body as a canvas, yes, but also an artwork.",
        "Zhe put all these elements together as zhe was working: My jaw is not so straight as it once was, and my face is rounder.",
        "Even my hair has a different texture now, and my body too is less muscular.",
        "The queer fade, zhe explained, is about putting all of those elements together to create a picture, an impression.",
        "One picture can be short but masculine.",
        "One can be hard and leave me still looking like a woman.",
        "One pet peeve of mine is that most hair cutters if I can even get them to cut my hair in a \u201cmasculine\u201d way then go sort of overboard, and they always somehow cut the back of my hair in a straight line across the back.",
        "I hate that.",
        "It looks boxy and harsh and inelegant and just because I am masculine presenting doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t appreciate elegance.",
        "The taper into the back of a neck is such a sensual and tender and sexy part of a person, one that I\u2019ve always loved, and I hate to think of my poor taper being boxed off\u2014it feels violent and disrespectful.",
        "I sat and watched Rhea buzz and snip, snip, snip and I heard a small gentle masculine sigh escape my hair that day, a sigh of relief at the touch of a barber who saw it, felt its queemess, understood its individuality.",
        "Finessed its masculine want.",
        "After Rhea finished, I slid my familiar sunglasses back on and took in my appearance.",
        "There was a look that was different, certainly, than my poor hair on those days after another shitty heteronormative buzz in a regular salon.",
        "But there was also a way in which I felt that my hair had found itself, was sitting up a little straighter (no pun intended), was more itself than it had been for some time, or ever.",

        "But if hair has its own life, its own journey, and Rhea and my queer fade were both an event for my human person, while at the same time an event for the living object of my hair, then the queer fade is an intra action, an example of Barad\u2019s agential realism while at the same time queering the notion.",
        "It is both binary and non binary, both queer and in the being seen/done by Rhea it is, finally, not queer at all.",

        "Each day, most people lose fifty to eighty hair strands, and each hair follicle produces a new hair which grows to maturity before falling out.",

        "It lasts from one to three or four years.",

        "This is the end of the hair fiber production cycle, when the follicle retracts from the surface of the scalp.",

        "Who knew hair has a resting phase? It makes sense, all that growing, it\u2019s hard work.",
        "In this resting phase, the hair is no longer growing, but is still attached for approximately three months, after which it starts to fall out when brushed or washed or when the human carrier is pulling their hair out after another trans or homophobic encounter.",
        "After the hair falls out, a new strand begins to form in the follicle, a cycle that is repeated twenty five to thirty times throughout the life cycle of the human carrier.",
        "This individual cycling of the hair growth and loss makes sense: if all the hairs on our heads grew at the same time, in synchronicity, we would go through bushy periods and bald periods.",

Is it possible to think productively about the affect of these objects as an intra active collaboration between the work \u201cdone\u201d by humans and things? In that collaboration, attention to the spaces, the silences and the not yets are important activators.",

Unlike language, the carrier of meaning between humans, \u201cversus\u201d the material, might silence be the carrier of affect between species? Anthony Giddens has called the separation between object and subject \u201contological security\u201d (1991) a notion that Barad has untangled through her now well known notion of \u201cagential cut,\u201d a concept for describing the \u201capparatus of observation,\u201d in which the subject object are recognized as separate and therefore able to interact with one another (see also the discussion of intraaction in terms of the archive in chapter 2 and queer object time in chapter 3).",

        "By decentering the human in queer and affect theory, we respond to Chen and Luciano\u2019s (2015) call to treat \u201cthe human\u201d as simply one of many elements in a queer critical assemblage, as well as understand critical storytelling practices as inherently queer practices in times of terror (Harris & Holman Jones 2017).",

        "This era\u2014the first quarter of the twenty first century\u2014is typified through digital technology as an era of \u201cthe archive,\u201d and characterized largely in response to the ways in which that archive demands to be curated (by humans racing to keep up).",
        "At the same time, the agency of the digital archive threatens to overwhelm the increasing anachronism and precarity of the non digital archive.",
        "What cannot be algorithmically searched, parsed, and curated increasingly does not exist.",
        "Though as Kathryn Ricketts writes, \u201cIf I am a museum of my own lived experiences, what are my artifacts?\u201d (Ricketts 2011, p.",
        "In this chapter, we argue that this process of re/making as \u201cdigitally intelligible\u201d is a kind of queering of the archive of human and nonhuman experience; a presumptive sign of \u201cprogress\u201d which leaves in its wake the ephemera of narrowing relevance and ballooning obsolescence, a threat to not only the material world but to thought worldings, relational practices and the notion of sustainability itself.",
        "What matters\u2014and consequently what is perceived to be worthy of \u201ckeeping\u201d\u2014is coming to be more and more narrowly defined.",

        "The many Van Gogh inspired selfies in this exhibition space provoke us to consider Van Gogh\u2019s numerous early self portraits as not just expedient due to his poverty (never sufficient funds for models), but also an iterative search for self representation, potentially an endless loop of creative autoethnography, and a signal of the impossibility of any fixed notion of self representation, differently embodied in the nineteenth century and now.",
        "That is, the archive may look different, but the human, posthuman, and creative impulse to accumulate, store and re/cover \u201chistorical knowledge and forms of remembrance\u201d is persistent and familiar (Merewether 2006, p.",

        "Contemporary archivists have moved their attention away from understanding knowledge or facts, toward making them, or what some in hybrid social movement theory, DIY, and digital cultures research formulate as curating them.",
        "Such teleological shifts trouble questions about expertness, user experience, and prosumer cultures.",
        "Some posthumanists, new materialists, and artificial intelligence scholars wonder about the impact of the possibility that increasingly the best experts of knowledge accumulation and interpretation are machine and/or nonhuman.",

        "Recent innovations in how we look at data, especially in more agentic ways, nudge researchers toward ever dynamic, multi directional and interactive relationships with the data we formerly may have thought of as \u201cours.\u201d Today, data is increasingly framed as \u201chaving a life,\u201d even while the dehumanization of organically human subjects deteriorates through environmental displacement, religious and other conflict.",

        "VAN GOGH AND HIS ARCHIVE The intense and problematic relationship between Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, most particularly their last parting, offers an example of an aesthetic and affective event which might be seen best through the paintings which both anticipated and remain from that encounter, rather than the narratives that are so often drawn upon.",
        "In late December 1888, merely two months into their 1888 house sharing arrangement in Arles, Gaugin left in a rage.",
        "Van Gogh entered his last, protracted, and relentless spiral downward into his eventual mental breakdown and death eighteen months later, on July 29, 1890.",
        "According to Van Gogh, they fought and Gaugin left, and in despair Van Gogh went walking, cut off his ear, then brought it to a local sex worker.",
        "However, other accounts suggest that perhaps Gaugin himself cut his friend\u2019s ear off, a fact which Van Gogh may have hidden.",
        "Either way, there is no real or exact evidence of events based on narrative accounts.",
        "Still, such \u201chistorical\u201d accounts continue to drive or frame our understandings of events, even in the postmodern recognition that narratives are subjective, incomplete and told by those with a vested interest in portraying the events in power drenched if not self congratulatory terms.",

        "In anticipation of the Gaugin\u2019s visit to Arles in October 1888, Van Gogh painted hopeful and exuberant sunflower canvases to decorate the house.",
        "He painted the chairs in November while they were together.",
        "Instead of painting portraits, straightforward renderings of himself and his idol, Van Gogh painted chairs, two symbolic portraits that contained all the ephemera and all the timeless symbolisms of the two men.",
        "They were, in a sense, in the tradition of the vanitas paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries from the Netherlands.",
        "They subtly showed both the vibrancy and decay of both men and their oeuvres.",
        "Van Gogh painted them as companion portraits, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Armchair,\u201d and his own \u201ccompanion painting,\u201d \u201cVincent\u2019s Chair with His Pipe.\u201d Gauguin\u2019s chair conveys a sense of shadow; deep, earthy reds, greens, and browns punctuated by bright yellow and blue; and two candles glowing and modem French novels on the seat of the chair\u2014a nod to Gauguin\u2019s imagination and use of dream imagery.",
        "The walls in the Arles cottage were white but Vincent painted them a deep green as a tribute to \u201cmystery and the night\u201d (\u201cGaugin\u2019s Chair\u201d 2018).",
        "Gauguin\u2019s visit was a big moment for Van Gogh as an artist, and Van Gogh was never easy in the company of his fellow artists, seeking and often failing at friendship and collaborative community.",
        "He had been inviting friends, artists, and colleagues from his time in Paris to come stay at Arles, to help him establish it as an artists\u2019 colony, and it was slow going, perhaps owing to his frequent quarrels with friends and family members.",
        "In the lead up to his mentor Gauguin\u2019s arrival, Van Gogh painted more than 200 works, including the more famous \u201cSunflowers\u201d and fruit trees.",

        "Van Gogh's Chair Van Gogh\u2019s own portrait was in bright yellow and blue, on the seat lay a simple clay pipe with tobacco and crumpled piece of paper, both humble things of the earth.",
        "Of the two Vincent\u2019s chair is the more rustic, made of cheaper wood, symbolic of his view that Gauguin was more sophisticated, worldly and successful.",
        "Van Gogh had technique, but Gauguin was considered a master of the conceptual.",
        "Which is more fully an ontological project, that which repositions humans outside of the means of making knowledge, of understanding and being? Or that which positions us as part of the workings of knowing, understanding and being, as enfolded into its very performance? Perhaps Vincent\u2019s pain can be considered the ontological center of meaning making in creative intra action rather than the workings of an individual human mind (or talent), so deeply confused, seeking to \u201crepresent\u201d meaning, being painted into sense for outside others.",
        "Perhaps, too, the chairs taken together, the companions they were meant to be, teach us about our desires to know and the show the world in all its dynamism and indeterminacy.",
        "How can inanimate things be companions? What does art know about affect that humans do not? We wander along shadowy cold November (2017) Amsterdam streets exploring these quandaries and considering how disappointed Gauguin must have been to finally acquiesce and go to Arles with the promise of heat, burning sunsets, and companionship, only to find a cold, windy, and unfriendly place.",

        "Narrative fails, but the chairs are resilient.",
        "We say Van Gogh was concerned with the \u201ctheory\u201d (or technique) of painting more than the content.",
        "His obsession was with brushstrokes and light; we compare this to formal versus theoretical innovation in our own worlds of scholarship.",
        "We debate the impossibility of Gauguin \u201cversus\u201d Van Gogh as the dreamlike versus the real, the qualitative versus quantitative, the mathematics of painting.",
        "Of the persistent and immature binary imperative of any us versus them.",
        "Van Gogh was committed to the \u201creal\u201d conditions and precar ity of his first subjects, yet equally committed to the burgeoning Impressionist and modernist movements, wishing create the mood and the resonance of \u201cThe Potato Eaters\u201d rather than any \u201crealist\u201d portrait.",
        "Gauguin, by contrast, was concerned with content, yet believed that the form was an imaginative rather than a space for \u201crendering\u201d anything real.",

        "He encouraged Van Gogh (and others) to paint from memory in order to stimulate the imagination.",
        "Vincent and Paul fought over this.",
        "We wonder (and disagree) at dinner whether this could be likened to scholars who are differently interested in or focused on theoretical or formal experimentation (the theorists, the philosophers) versus those who are primarily concerned with \u201capplied\u201d research, that is the content, relationship, and mode.",
        "In this formulation, we decide that Van Gogh would be an affect scholar, and Gauguin a methodologist.",
        "There are myriad analyzes of the chairs and their symbolism as both representing the two men as well as psychoanalytic considerations of Van Gogh\u2019s homoerotic attraction for Gauguin as well as his less symbolic differentiation between them along class lines.",
        "Rather than these tacts (or tactics), here we are interested in Van Gogh and his intra action with a number of objects and beings: the chairs, the house, the ear, Gauguin, his brother Theo, the prostitute and the hospital.",
        "The links provide a breadcrumb trail that resists analysis and affectually queers the archive.",
        "They co constitute an archive that, in its collectivity, tells other stories in remnants and material traces.",
        "No words, only traces.",
        "We reject the meta narrative of Vincent as mad, and his brother Theo as \u201ctogether.\u201d We appreciate and notice their interdependence (whether noted by art historians or not), noting that Theo died so soon (six months) after the loss of Vincent.",

        "We recognize them as two sides of the same material and spiritual and practice led body.",
        "We recognize the inability of Vincent to offer his ear (his vulnerability) to Gauguin, or his brother, or any intimate other\u2014he cut it in a field, and offered it to a stranger.",
        "In grief and despair, Van Gogh was still offering others objects, material manifestations of a desire for what? Recognition? Connection? Differentiation? Care? Whatever his desires, each and all of his attempts fail to cement any effective emotional tie to follow.",
        "In their solidity, perhaps Van Gogh was hoping to find a queering of the emotional unmooring that he was feeling: Perhaps Gauguin should have worried about what his friend was feeling when he portrayed both of them like this\u2014gone, vanished, leaving only their old familiar chairs.",
        "After all, Van Gogh, who loved English graphic art, got the idea from an obituary image.",
        "At Christmas 1870 the Victorian magazine the Graphic published a valediction for an absent fixture of Christmas past: Charles Dickens had died that year, and Luke Fildes\u2019[s] illustration The Empty Chair, Gad\u2019s Hill\u2014Ninth of June 1870 depicts Dickens\u2019s chair at his desk, pulled back, but empty, no one there to write that year\u2019s Christmas story....Van Gogh smoked a pipe because Dickens advised it as a cure for melancholy.",

        "The need for (or illusion of) refuge, a basic need for most animals, is evoked by the functional but also symbolic power of the house or home, but also of such affective objects as Van Gogh\u2019s paintings from late 1888 at Arles.",
        "THE POSTHUMAN POWER OF THE PAINTING RETURN In one of Van Gogh\u2019s most famous Arles paintings, Sunflowers, the flowers are dying.",
        "For the two of us wandering in the Van Gogh museum on this rainy day, it\u2019s a self told tale of sunflowers, by the sunflowers.",
        "An autoethnography of sunflowers.",
        "We feel their insistence of their own truth, not an artist\u2019s depiction of an idealized bouquet for the enjoyment of others, but this is a fantasy, isn\u2019t it? The paintings are painted by Van Gogh\u2019s hand, painted for himself perhaps, and an audience of other non sunflowers.",
        "Still, we love it because there is truth in self telling, self representation, even when it is mediated, as by Van Gogh.",
        "Simple, radiant, heavy flowers, all facing different directions.",
        "There\u2019s a feeling of power in their heavy heads.",
        "The sunflowers, the house, and Gauguin, were all a part of Van Gogh\u2019s vision of building an artists\u2019 community in the house at Arles, a place where he might finally belong, a place of his making, his belonging, an alternative space\u2014a gift, he might have thought\u2014and yet, no one wanted his gift.",
        "Later, he offered his ear but that gift too was unwanted.",
        "To have Gaugin come, finally, after so much cajoling, and indeed only once Vincent\u2019s brother Theo agreed to pay a monthly stipend to the destitute Gauguin, and him staying so briefly, was worse than perhaps not coming at all.",
        "In the end, all Van Gogh had was an empty house.",
        "Two empty chairs.",
        "And the sunflowers.",
        "He painted five versions of \u201cThe Sunflowers\u201d between August and September of 1888, all full of dazzling light.",
        "He preferred the dying, the rundown, the rustic, because he said it was, to him, more true to life.",
        "We vibrate with Vincent in these identifications of life in death, light in shadow, beauty in the rustic, the broken down, belonging in the abject.",
        "These are not vibrant sunflowers in full bloom, but they are sunflowers demanding to be heard and seen in their dying light.",
        "We are moved by their vulnerability, their humility, their truth in decay.",
        "We are held fast by these sunflowers in a busy gallery space with humans moving quickly past, buzzing, a word here or there.",
        "We find a posthuman insistence here, a refusal to move on as Van Gogh and other humans have (inevitably) had to do.",
        "The paintings remain in ways that we cannot.",
        "We are comforted by their heavy materiality and resilience.",
        "We rejoice in the cross breeding between paint and human and the hybrid beings like sunflowers that can come of these border crossings.",
        "In May 1889, after his bad time with the ear, Van Gogh entered the asylum at Saint Remy, not far from Arles.",
        "In that single year before he died, he created approximately 142 works.",
        "One of them was The Irises in May 1889, while still in the asylum.",
        "This painting is bright blue on a yellow contrasting background and also some of the dying flowers are falling over (he did two distinct versions, but only the one at the museum in Amsterdam has the dying flowers, the other is more cheerful).",
        "Needless to say, he preferred the irises in their decline.",
        "It is one of his most famous works, and in 1987 (temporarily) became the most expensive painting ever sold, going for $54 million (Reif 1987).",
        "This painting life, this commodity life, is inextricably tied to Vincent\u2019s and yet is independent as well.",
        "Its vibrancy is often overshadowed by Van Gogh\u2019s biography, his timeline, his mental and emotional life narrative.",
        "The materiality of the work\u2014like the chairs, and the sunflowers\u2014struggles to be encountered in its own time, taken on its own merits, even in this so called postmodern moment in which the author is no longer foregrounded in considerations of works of art.",
        "Even the totemic value, the aura of the work, is not its primary calling card in popular contexts and conversations but rather its place in relation to Van Gogh.",
        "And like all family members, surely The Irises has its own identity, its independent agency, its queer life apart from it co creator, its maker, its material parent Vincent.",
        "Yet Vincent\u2019s relationship with the environment, as opposed to the consistently disappointing human race, is also evident in the trend of subject in his final works.",
        "His focus near the end, in such paintings as Wheat Field with Reaper (September 1889) as well as Almond Blossom (Feb 1890), is increasingly tied to the sky.",
        "No longer intent on peasant faces or human life in literal ways at all (as he began), he goes back to his love of nature, his comfort in beauty and the outdoors, a place of belonging.",
        "Tree Roots (late July 1890), Wheat Fields with Crows (July 1890) and others during this last period take the viewer back into the earth.",
        "Vincent\u2019s more than human orientations and sources of comfort document not just ways of seeing and encountering, but also of core relationships between the human and nonhuman, our deep need of the nonhuman, and the endlessly unconditional belonging and renewal to be found there.",
        "The wheat fields in which Vincent spent so much of his final months painting, and in which he eventually shot himself, might have their own ways of holding and re/telling what Van Gogh brought to them.",
        "Images of these works are now in the public domain, given the length of time since the artist\u2019s death.",
        "We review them online after our intimate encounter with so many of them at the Amsterdam museum, and compare the disembodied experience with the proximate one.",
        "So much is lost.",
        "And why, we wonder, is the agency of these representations taken (or given) in relation to their human maker still? At a time when the \u201cpersonhood\u201d of an increasing range of sea animals and natural environments are being recognized and protected by the United Nations and other international rights\u2019 bodies, we wonder at the rights of these images (if not their expensive material bodies) to be circulated without their permission.",
        "Artworks like these might play their own role in digital and disembodied posthuman agency, and the queering of nonhuman rights.",
        "If, for example, such works\u2019 original incarnations can sell for tens of millions of dollars, and yet their digital reproductions can be circulated and \u201cused\u201d without permission, how does that alter the relationship between iterations of Wheat Fields with Crows, for example, if not between the works and Vincent himself? Here, in the pages of this manuscript, itself a digital and material work, Van Gough\u2019s paintings have created yet other image bodies and relationships\u2014in this case, Michael Crowhurst\u2019s painting A Dog/Cat Thing with Fishes, a material and virtual response to Van Gough\u2019s chairs, our account of encountering those chairs, and the conversations the collision of those images and ideas sponsored.",
        "In each iteration, digital works are altering material works in ways that queer the category of relationship between virtual/material more generally.",
        "We read Van Gogh\u2019s preoccupation with form to be a corollary of the evolution of his content, in the same way that theory and practice work together and mutually inform one another in scholarly work.",
        "Van Gogh started with portraits of peasants; when he moved to Paris, he began to experiment with color, composition, and brushstroke in still lifes mostly concerned with beauty and affect, and near the end of his life created increasingly abstract renderings of nature that evoke emotional states more than reach for symbolic representations.",
        "The vast majority of the (seemingly endless) curatorial commentary on Van Gogh and his troubled work and life focuses primarily on the masterful, completely experimental, stylistic aspects of his late works, but neglects to wonder why he becomes increasingly abstract, possibly because despite his extensive body of letters left behind, it remains mostly conjecture.",

        "Waiting is a multitude of possibilities, a time of \u201cemergent relations,\u201d of what James calls \u201cdifferent degrees of intimacy,\u201d or what Manning she calls the site \u201cwhere experimentation remains open,\u201d prior to the occasion culminating or closing down the potential of the other events into the actualisation of the singular event (2011, n.p.; see also Harris, Holman Jones, Faulkner, & Brook 2017).",
        "Manning works into the exciting posthuman possibilities of the non dual human computer relations possible in online (or even online/offline hybrid) worlds: that is, web life encourages us to reject dualism and \u201cwork instead with the ever changing sets of knower known relations, [where] thought things collide most forcefully in the not yet of a node\u2019s actualization.",
        "The networking happens not in the actualization of the node, but in the connective tissue of its tending toward\u201d (2011, n.p.) And yet, she continues to indirectly focus on human experience in her discussion, unpacking the ways in which the network has changed our understandings and experience of \u201creal\u201d and in user relations.",
        "We are most interested in the agency of the network, how it seems (sometimes terrifying, sometimes thrilling) to be changing not only human self image, but the notion of \u201creal\u201d (which of course we see as synonymous with human) characteristics.",
        "That is, we still see the network serving humanity, rather than the network becoming ascendant and directing our actions and goals.",
        "Manning does end with just such possibility, suggesting that the network is building itself a different kind of network.",
        "She writes, \u201cIt may lead to the kitchen for a glass of juice which may lead to the cat which may lead to the couch which may lead to a nap.",
        "Or simply back to the computer to check the status of the latest tab\u201d (2011, n.p.).",
        "But what if the human (even if unstated) was no longer the actor? What if the new network possibilities do not include human \u201cusers\u201d at all? Certainly, the flush of infatuation with artificial intelligence shows us that in the first instance humans are always central: we build things to serve us.",
        "But there have been more than enough dystopic novels to remind us that it\u2019s not difficult to supersede human intelligence, and in fact it has been happening for years in computational design, algorithmic complexity and elsewhere.",
        "Posthumanism as a theoretical project concerned with the logical progression toward living and non living things becoming more self determining, fits in some manifestations with the concurrent rise in activist and legislative advocacy for the rights of non human others including oceans, and animals.",
        "So, is it such a \u201cqueer life\u201d for computers to begin to advocate for then own rights, and can we imagine the ethical and moral challenges of such a turn, now, when we are still socioculturally in the phase of rapidly developing them for our own ends? It is the twenty first century industry and moral quandary of slavery\u2014but a slavery of, and perhaps to, things.",
        "Morally, this it can only go one way as well because even humans can see\u2014as we did with the enslavement of other humans eventually)\u2014that it is indefensible to argue the enslavement of any other beings in service to any other set of beings.",
        "The conditions that are now being established, and its prime indicator, which will eventually make this significant \u201cthing rights\u201d issue a central issue of this century, is the ways in which we are simultaneously exploring the agency of non human things while \u201chumanizing\u201d or anthropomorphis ing things (think the film Her).",
        "So, we say yes to Manning\u2019s claim that the event is the thing, that waiting is just one example of a new kind of human thing relation, but at the same time remembering the event is being directed by our insatiable hunger for developing \u201cthe thing.\u201d That event\u2014all those infinite possibilities\u2014are still, at this point, being directed by the instigating actions of the human.",
        "This will not always be so.",
        "WHERE ARE \"WE\" IN QUEER ECOLOGY? Manning acknowledges (through extending her example of waiting) that \u201cwhen knower becomes the field of relations itself, it is no longer the human subject who makes all decision.\u201d \u201cIs there agency?\u201d she asks.",

        "She urges us to remain open to infinite possibilities, even/especially in digital worlds, and perhaps we will.",
        "But human tendency seems to be to foreclose, and why would we consider online worlds to be different? We are in some way inherently agoraphobic beings: we want to delimit the parameters of our existence, all the while still marvelling at its infinity.",

        "The use of the dispersants underwater (unlike applying it to the surface, the more conventional approach) did not clean up the oil as intended, but rather \u201cmix with it and accelerate the dispersal process, but the combination of oil and dispersant has now been shown in research by Temple University to be more harmful to corals than the oil itself\u2019 (Cameron 2015, n.p.).",

        "Chen\u2019s (2012) analysis of this same oil spill focuses on the human centered response (from BP and the media itself) and the abnegation of responsibility to the non human victims of the disaster.7 Chen focuses on the market driven obsessions of the human players in this drama and the \u201cdeathly\u2014and lifely\u2014language\u201d used to produce relief and trust in a public addicted to believing in containment and victory (2012, p.",

In Chen\u2019s 2015 special issue on \u201cqueer inhumanisms\u201d Barad writes: What is needed is not a universalization of trans or queer experience stripped of all its specificities (as inflected through race, nationality, ethnicity, class, and other normalizing apparatuses of power), setting these terms up as concepts that float above the materiality of particular embodied experiences, but to make alliances with, to build on an already existing radical tradition (a genealogy going back at least to Marx) that troubles nature and its naturalness \u201call the way down.\u201d...",

        "However, in asking questions about whether and how animals can be kin\u2014 brothers and sisters or perhaps parents or children\u2014Oliver reminds us that Merleau Ponty is not interested in establishing an impassable divide between animals and humans; nor is he invested in anthropomorphizing animals by extending human characteristics or consciousness to them.",
        "Instead, human bodies, consciousness and desires resonate with animal bodies, consciousness, and desires.",

        "Indeed, our notions of family as a \u201cnatural\u201d arrangement between human beings are based on presumptions about heterosexual attraction and reproduction that articulate with governmental structures (Hill Collins 1998, p.",

        "While the family is a projected and institutionalized object/orientation designed to reproduce naturalized hierarchies, for those of us who find such families hard places and spaces to survive, we can\u2014we do\u2014find kinship in unexpected and strange places that are resoundingly and importantly material and embodied (Ahmed 2016; Freeman 2007, p.",

        "Occasionally we wonder what is in store for us, always framed as How long do we have together? While time and temporality are certainly not static or linear, they still dictate in so many ways the story/stories of our lives, much more so than understandings of spatiality which are so quickly shifting in this still young twenty first century.",
        "Time and place, embodiment and affect, matter and form.",
        "In our shared work, we have our own preoccupations; as Ahmed does with stones (2016), we do with dogs and bridges, haircuts and mermaids.",
        "Some time ago, one or us, or the other, reread her bringing together of phenomenology and queer theory, musing on pebbles becoming queer, in which she uses the humble pebble to urge us past the matter/form binary, or what she calls hierarchy, \u201cwhich locates what is dynamic in form and leaves matter \u2018for dead\u2019\u201d (2006, p.",
        "187).",
        "Ahmed prefigures the intra action of time, agency and matter with her pebble talk: But the pebble acquires its shape through contact; and it is this contact that reshapes the pebble such that it is becoming something \u201cother\u201d than what it is.",
        "Time \u201cgives form,\u201d which suggests that \u201cmatter\u201d is not inert or given, but is always in a process of \u201cmaterialising.\u201d (Butler 1993, p.",

        "The \u201cbecoming\u201d or \u201carrival\u201d of the object both takes time and involves contact with other objects, and it is an arrival that, perhaps, may come to pass as the opening g up of the future to forms that have yet to emerge, (p.",

        "This book is our pebble, cast onto the beach\u2014ours and yours.",
        "We hope it brings you a delicious and productive disorientation.",
        "We hope the intra action of the theorists and objects and thing thoughts here helps make strange and disorient not only new materialisms, posthumanism, and affect and performance theories, but also yourself in the encounter, an emergence that both entangles your thoughts and sets them free.",
        "We have enjoyed the overlaps and contradictions in the conversation between theories, things, stories, objects, and performances both live and virtual, and we have used queer to push past the human in considerations of assemblages, events, and ecologies in which humans and humanism persistently attempt to re center them/ourselves.",
        "The Anthropocene, for all its fascination, continues to hold humans at the center of where \u201cthe world is heading,\u201d and we challenge that formation.",
        "Perhaps it\u2019s our nature, as queer animals, to do such challenging, as we\u2019re never been, felt, or become central to where the world is or wants to be.",
        "While acknowledging that we can\u2019t in some ways get past our own orientations, we also believe in the urgency of our project in all of its messy emergences and queer ways of doing things.",
        "In this work, we have not sought to advance some \u201cnew\u201d structure of queer posthumanism (believing, indeed, that there is nothing \u201cnew\u201d under the sun), but rather have endeavored to return to the original promise of queer theory and its intervention as an anti teleological project.",
        "That is, queer theory and queering practices are not explanations or embodied justifications of what\u2019s human (or humane) and doesn\u2019t address harms we have done, and continue to do to animal and object others.",
        "Part of the project of this book is simply to call out the danger of seeking teleos, and the intellectual machine of the academy has done its own harm in fetishizing explanations, rather than looking for interventions or at least a \u201charm minimization,\u201d as Haraway continues to demand.",
        "We offer this text as a theoretical and narrative admission of our own participation in human de/centered de/con/structions while staying \u201ctrue\u201d to belief that the listening and acting in humbly humane ways and embodiments, however \u201cferal,\u201d can indeed contribute to making things better and perhaps right.",
        "Knowledge can be helpful when it is useful.",
        "As Ahmed and others continue to remind us, disorientation is a powerful antidote to mastery and to colonizing certitude.",
        "We\u2019ve been on a wild journey in creating this text, and while we don\u2019t pretend to have hard and fast \u201cconclusions\u201d or \u201csolutions,\u201d we offer, by way of opening (rather than concluding) the conversation, the provocations we\u2019ve advanced in this book, namely: \u2022 Reading theorizations of transcendence and immanence as guides to queering new materialism in rejecting binaries of im/materiality, which help us queer notions of the human and nonhuman more generally, including objects.",
        "Believing in the idea that objects have their own affective and material lives helps us decenter human subjectivity in ways that are urgently needed if we are to sustain the kind of activist embodiments necessary to make change in the contemporary world.",
        "\u2022 Considering \u201cthe archive\u201d\u2014both material and digital\u2014as an inter active embodiment of not only what knowledge counts, but also what knowledge is needed in a world.",
        "Such an archive sees human and nonhuman lives as unintelligible traces broken (data).",
        "Reading artefacts as intra active relationships created as both form and techne, we understand the \u201cwork\u201d of art as an enfleshed materialism caught up, as it must be, in creating \u201cfuture fables for now.\u201d \u2022 Wondering about the relationship between queemess, time, and objects, as a means of transisting (or performing), rather than transporting (or disposing with) indeterminacy, matter, and identity.",
        "These are important questions not only for seeing animals (human and other) and animate and inanimate objects as distinct, co existent, and mutually valuable but also integral to a future enacted and sustained in becoming with (rather than becoming at expense of an/other).",
        "\u2022 Working the impossible binaries of human and nonhuman, animate and inanimate, live and dead for the political possibilities and other worldings these impossibilities open up for queering understandings of what it means to responsibly and vibrantly inhabit the Earth.",
        "\u2022 Joyfully\u2014though not without complication, consideration, and accountability\u2014embracing and embodying our relationships with other animals in kinship model that sustains us in an often unkind, unsafe, and annihilating world.",
        "Only in the queer entanglements of responsibility and regard can we constitute an us\u2014as kin and as ken.",
        "We offer these words, ideas, and movements as an invitation to not only talk about the queer life of things, or animals or objects, but also to get stuck into attuning and attaching to them more robustly and meaningfully that we\u2014or you\u2014might have before.",
        "Night is closing in on another day in Melbourne\u2014a day in which we did not walk along the beach or kneel down in the grass or ask, as Mary Oliver (1992) does in \u201cThe Summer Day,\u201d who \u201cmade the world\u201d or the swan or the black bear or the grasshopper (p.",
        "The dogs are getting restless, wanting their evening walk and their supper.",
