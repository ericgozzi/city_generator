I can remember only two. One, in Junior School, when the Deputy Head told us that the PG chimps were paid more than the workers picking the tea leaves (good man!), and two, in the autumn of 1979, when Margaret Iles and Suzanne Couling stood up, in Olchfa Comprehensive School, Swansea, and read out the end of Chapter Eighteen of this very book. Ah, the bowl of petunias, and the whale. \u2018Oh no, not again.\u2019 And we sat up. We listened. We laughed. For once, we felt part of an assembly, because we knew this stuff. It was a rare moment for teenagers: a shared knowledge of a piece of writing, a shared love. Because, back then, in those days of post punk and Green Flash and Anti Nazi League badges, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy was something truly unique. It was cool. \u2018Cool\u2019 is a horrible word. Too close to cold. It smacks of the beautiful elite. But this book was cool in the best way \u2013 wise and true and subversive and, most importantly, forging a connection between people. And here I mean the paperback specifically. Sure, lots of us loved the radio series, and strained to listen to Radio 4 on Long Wave, but there was just something so special about having all that brilliance, and all those jokes, in book form. It was so portable. So available. So ready to be passed around. In my whole life, I can\u2019t remember a book being so shared. We owned it, with pride, so many of us \u2013 not just the elite, but the whole range, from swots to rugby boys, from girl gangs to young offenders, the tall, the short and the lonely, let alone that vast majority of kids with no label. We carried it around, like an iPod, like cigarettes, like a Gideon\u2019s Bible. You\u2019d see that novel, with its cover like neon left out in the rain, jutting out of back pockets and school bags, clutched like a shield, passed from hand to hand like an initiation. Okay, maybe Harry Potter had a similar moment of glory. But you could never fit that into your back pocket. (This new edition still fits, I just checked.) Because that\u2019s what I loved about this version of Hitchhiker\u2019s, above any other; the soft, bendy, riffable paperbackness of it. It\u2019s vital to remember how much Douglas Adams can mean to kids. As time passes, Hitchhiker\u2019s can acquire something of an elevated air, straddling Oxbridge and Hollywood. But this thing belongs to the playground! When you\u2019re young, and just emerging from the four walls of home into the wide world outside, that\u2019s exactly when you feel so small, like Arthur Dent, all alone in the universe. That\u2019s when you act as wildly two headed as Zaphod. That\u2019s when you really need someone to say \u2018Don\u2019t Panic\u2019. It\u2019s the perfect age to mutter a heartfelt \u2018Oh no, not again,\u2019 a phrase so much wiser than today\u2019s \u2018Whatever\u2019. When we laughed out loud at the poor petunias\u2019 punchline, way back in 1979, it wasn\u2019t just because it was funny. It was because we agreed. I don\u2019t think Douglas Adams is ever included in the lists of great children\u2019s writers. Maybe they don\u2019t ask enough children. But while the Great Man wrote with magnificent intellect and dazzling philosophy, with prose powerful enough to generate a million academic essays, there\u2019s surely the heart of a Great Big Kid inside these pages. And that\u2019s the greatest compliment! All kids invent stories. They imagine games of War, or Doctor Who and the Daleks, or the wonderful logic of Off Ground Touch. But then hormones and kissing and spots take over, and storytelling is put aside; or maybe people simply focus on telling the story of their own lives. But the best writers, I think, don\u2019t forget. They carry that childlike lunacy with them forever, its joy and its danger, and Hitchhiker\u2019s is packed with that unique energy, all barmy and bristling and bold. This book can be witty, iconoclastic, godless, savage, sweet, surreal, but above all, it dares to be silly. Fiercely, beautifully silly. No wonder it became a banner, a badge, a totem, for the Class of \u201979. Douglas Adams was writing for us. And a good book has a radioactive half life way beyond our childhoods. Just a few years ago, I was buying a house. The owner showed me round. I looked at the bookshelves, like you do. And there it was. The original paperback. The wet neon. I picked it out, and just smiled; the man smiled back. We didn\u2019t need to say anything, but it was still there, that connection between strangers, almost thirty years later. Something we once loved, and love now, in the shape of a book. Maybe eBooks are going to take over, one day, but not until those whizzkids in Silicon Valley invent a way to bend the corners, fold the spine, yellow the pages, add a coffee ring or two and allow the plastic tablet to fall open at a favourite page. So, for God\u2019s sake, when you\u2019ve finished this book, don\u2019t seal it away on a shelf. Put it in your pocket. Pass it round. Spread the word. Leave it on a bus! And complete the circle \u2013 go on, someone, please, read it out in a school assembly. Because they\u2019ll love it, those kids, I promise; they will find it makes so much sense. Douglas Adams is waiting for them. So hand over this lovely paperback, for the next thirty years. RUSSELL T DAVIES Writer and producer of Doctor Who and Torchwood Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy lies a small un regarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. This planet has \u2013 or rather had \u2013 a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy. And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches. Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\u00e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything. Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost for ever. This is not her story. But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences. It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy \u2013 not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or even heard of by any Earthmen. Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book. In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor \u2013 of which no Earthman had ever heard either. Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one \u2013 more popular than The Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty three More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid\u2019s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God\u2019s Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway? In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON\u2019T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover. But the story of this terrible stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply. It begins with a house. 1 The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village. It stood on its own and looked out over a broad spread of West Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means \u2013 it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye. The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable. He was about thirty as well, tall, dark haired and never quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about. He worked in local radio, which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought. It was, too \u2013 most of his friends worked in advertising. On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent\u2019s house for what was to be that last time. It hadn\u2019t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead. At eight o\u2019clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn\u2019t feel very good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash. Toothpaste on the brush \u2013 so. Scrub. Shaving mirror \u2013 pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent\u2019s bristles. He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth. Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn. The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with. The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one. He stared at it. \u2018Yellow,\u2019 he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed. Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror. \u2018Yellow,\u2019 he thought and stomped on to the bedroom. He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important. He\u2019d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people\u2019s faces. Something about a new bypass he\u2019d just found out about. It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort itself out, he\u2019d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out. God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue. \u2018Yellow,\u2019 he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with. Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path. Mr L. Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was a carbon based bipedal life form descended from an ape. More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby, and worked for the local council. Curiously enough, though he didn\u2019t know it, he was also a direct male line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr L. Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats. He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job \u2013 which was to see that Arthur Dent\u2019s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out. \u2018Come off it, Mr Dent,\u2019 he said, \u2018you can\u2019t win, you know. You can\u2019t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.\u2019 He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn\u2019t do it. Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him. \u2018I\u2019m game,\u2019 he said, \u2018we\u2019ll see who rusts first.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to accept it,\u2019 said Mr Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, \u2018this bypass has got to be built and it\u2019s going to be built!\u2019 \u2018First I\u2019ve heard of it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018why\u2019s it got to be built?\u2019 Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again. \u2018What do you mean, why\u2019s it got to be built?\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s a bypass. You\u2019ve got to build bypasses.\u2019 Bypasses are devices which allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what\u2019s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what\u2019s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they want to be. Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn\u2019t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn\u2019t know why \u2013 he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers. He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn\u2019t him. Mr Prosser said, \u2018You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.\u2019 \u2018Appropriate time?\u2019 hooted Arthur. \u2018Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I asked him if he\u2019d come to clean the windows and he said no he\u2019d come to demolish the house. He didn\u2019t tell me straight away, of course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver. Then he told me.\u2019 \u2018But, Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn\u2019t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.\u2019 \u2018But the plans were on display...\u2019 \u2018On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the display department.\u2019 \u2018With a torch.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well the lights had probably gone.\u2019 \u2018So had the stairs.\u2019 \u2018But look, you found the notice, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard.\u2019 A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent\u2019s house. Mr Prosser frowned at it. \u2018It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a particularly nice house,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I happen to like it.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll like the bypass.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up,\u2019 said Arthur Dent. \u2018Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you. You haven\u2019t got a leg to stand on and you know it.\u2019 Mr Prosser\u2019s mouth opened and closed a couple of times whilst his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent\u2019s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together. \u2018Mr Dent,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hello? Yes?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?\u2019 \u2018How much?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018None at all,\u2019 said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him. By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed. Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this. This friend of his had first arrived on the planet Earth some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society \u2013 with, it must be said, some success. For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough. He had made one careless blunder, though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name \u2018Ford Prefect\u2019 as being nicely inconspicuous. He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose. There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn\u2019t seem to blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck. He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one \u2013 an unruly boozer with some oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicists he could find till he got thrown out. Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin. \u2018Oh, just looking for flying saucers,\u2019 he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for. \u2018Green ones!\u2019 he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks. Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn\u2019t matter that much really. Thereafter, staggering semi paralytic down the night streets, he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like, \u2018Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you went off home, sir?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m trying to, baby, I\u2019m trying to,\u2019 is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions. In fact what he was really looking for when he stared distractedly into the sky was any kind of flying saucer at all. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts. Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindbogglingly dull as the Earth. Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairian dollars a day. In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur\u2019s house had settled into a steady routine. It was Arthur\u2019s accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother, or a good book; it was Mr Prosser\u2019s accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, or the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers\u2019 accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage. The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course. The sun was beginning to dry out the mud that Arthur lay in. A shadow moved across him again. \u2018Hello, Arthur,\u2019 said the shadow. Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him. \u2018Ford! Hello, how are you?\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018look, are you busy?\u2019 \u2018Am I busy?\u2019 exclaimed Arthur. \u2018Well, I\u2019ve just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they\u2019ll knock my house down if I don\u2019t, but other than that... well, no not especially, why?\u2019 They don\u2019t have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, \u2018Good, is there anywhere we can talk?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur Dent. For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur. \u2018We\u2019ve got to talk,\u2019 he said urgently. \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018talk.\u2019 \u2018And drink,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It\u2019s vitally important that we talk and drink. Now. We\u2019ll go to the pub in the village.\u2019 He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant. \u2018Look, don\u2019t you understand?\u2019 shouted Arthur. He pointed at Prosser. \u2018That man wants to knock my house down!\u2019 Ford glanced at him, puzzled. \u2018Well, he can do it while you\u2019re away, can\u2019t he?\u2019 he asked. \u2018But I don\u2019t want him to!\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 \u2018Look, what\u2019s the matter with you, Ford?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Nothing. Nothing\u2019s the matter. Listen to me \u2013 I\u2019ve got to tell you the most important thing you\u2019ve ever heard. I\u2019ve got to tell you now, and I\u2019ve got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.\u2019 \u2018But why?\u2019 \u2018Because you\u2019re going to need a very stiff drink.\u2019 Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find his will beginning to weaken. He didn\u2019t realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford had learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta. The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this: Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them. Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song \u2018Oh don\u2019t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit / No, don\u2019t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit / For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die / Won\u2019t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit\u2019). Each of the two contestants would then concentrate his will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent \u2013 who would then have to drink it. The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played again. And again. Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx Spirit is to depress telepsychic power. As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological. Ford Prefect usually played to lose. Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all. \u2018But what about my house...?\u2019 he asked plaintively. Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him. \u2018He wants to knock your house down?\u2019 \u2018Yes, he wants to build...\u2019 \u2018And he can\u2019t because you\u2019re lying in front of his bulldozer?\u2019 \u2018Yes, and...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m sure we can come to some arrangement,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Excuse me!\u2019 he shouted. Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did) looked around. He was surprised and slightly alarmed to see that Arthur had company. \u2018Yes? Hello?\u2019 he called. \u2018Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet?\u2019 \u2018Can we for the moment,\u2019 called Ford, \u2018assume that he hasn\u2019t?\u2019 \u2018Well?\u2019 sighed Mr Prosser. \u2018And can we also assume,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that he\u2019s going to be staying here all day?\u2019 \u2018So?\u2019 \u2018So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?\u2019 \u2018Could be, could be...\u2019 \u2018Well, if you\u2019re resigned to doing that anyway, you don\u2019t actually need him to lie here all the time, do you?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford patiently, \u2018actually need him here.\u2019 Mr Prosser thought about this. \u2018Well no, not as such...\u2019 he said, \u2018not exactly need...\u2019 Mr Prosser was worried. He thought that one of them wasn\u2019t making a lot of sense. Ford said, \u2018So if you would just like to take it as read that he\u2019s actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an hour. How does that sound?\u2019 Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty. \u2018That sounds perfectly reasonable...\u2019 he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure. \u2018And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we can always cover for you in return.\u2019 \u2018Thank you very much,\u2019 said Mr Prosser, who no longer knew how to play this at all, \u2018thank you very much, yes, that\u2019s very kind...\u2019 He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won. \u2018So,\u2019 continued Ford Prefect, \u2018if you would just like to come over here and lie down...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Mr Prosser. \u2018Ah, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018perhaps I hadn\u2019t made myself fully clear. Somebody\u2019s got to lie in front of the bulldozers, haven\u2019t they? Or there won\u2019t be anything to stop them driving into Mr Dent\u2019s house, will there?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Mr Prosser again. \u2018It\u2019s very simple,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018my client, Mr Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and take over from him.\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet. \u2018You want me,\u2019 said Prosser, spelling out his new thought to himself, \u2018to come and lie there...\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018In front of the bulldozer?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Instead of Mr Dent.\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018In the mud.\u2019 \u2018In, as you say, the mud.\u2019 As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed. \u2018In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the pub?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that\u2019s it exactly.\u2019 Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped. \u2018Promise?\u2019 he said. \u2018Promise,\u2019 said Ford. He turned to Arthur. \u2018Come on,\u2019 he said to him, \u2018get up and let the man lie down.\u2019 Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream. Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes. Ford looked at him severely. \u2018And no sneaky knocking Mr Dent\u2019s house down whilst he\u2019s away, all right?\u2019 he said. \u2018The mere thought,\u2019 growled Mr Prosser, \u2018hadn\u2019t even begun to speculate,\u2019 he continued, settling himself back, \u2018about the merest possibility of crossing my mind.\u2019 He saw the bulldozer drivers\u2019 union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about this \u2013 his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable or put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered. He began to feel little pricks of water behind his eyelids. Bureaucratic cock ups, angry men lying in mud, indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head \u2013 what a day. What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn\u2019t matter a pair of dingo\u2019s kidneys whether Arthur\u2019s house got knocked down or not now. Arthur remained very worried. \u2018But can we trust him?\u2019 he said. \u2018Myself, I\u2019d trust him to the end of the Earth,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018and how far\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018About twelve minutes away,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Come on, I need a drink.\u2019 2 Here\u2019s what The Encyclopaedia Galactica has to say about alcohol. It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon based life forms. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. It says that the effect of drinking a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate afterwards. The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself. Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol\u2019 Janx Spirit, it says. Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V \u2013 Oh, that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean fish!!! Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost). Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia. Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic. Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink. Sprinkle Zamphuor. Add an olive. Drink... but... very carefully... The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than The Encyclopaedia Galactica. \u2018Six pints of bitter,\u2019 said Ford Prefect to the barman of the Horse and Groom. \u2018And quickly, please, the world\u2019s about to end.\u2019 The barman of the Horse and Groom didn\u2019t deserve this sort of treatment, he was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared out of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur, who shrugged helplessly and said nothing. So the barman said, \u2018Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it,\u2019 and started pulling pints. He tried again. \u2018Going to watch the match this afternoon, then?\u2019 Ford glanced round at him. \u2018No, no point,\u2019 he said, and looked back out of the window. \u2018What\u2019s that, foregone conclusion then you reckon, sir?\u2019 said the barman. \u2018Arsenal without a chance?\u2019 \u2018No, no,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018it\u2019s just that the world\u2019s about to end.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, sir, so you said,\u2019 said the barman, looking over his glasses this time at Arthur. \u2018Lucky escape for Arsenal if it did.\u2019 Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised. \u2018No, not really,\u2019 he said. He frowned. The barman breathed in heavily. \u2018There you are, sir, six pints,\u2019 he said. Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had heard what was going on. None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was smiling at them for. A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men, looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic, arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin at them. \u2018Get off,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018they\u2019re ours,\u2019 giving him a look that would have made an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing. Ford slapped a five pound note on the bar. He said, \u2018Keep the change.\u2019 \u2018What, from a fiver? Thank you, sir.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve got ten minutes left to spend it.\u2019 The barman decided simply to walk away for a bit. \u2018Ford,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018would you please tell me what the hell is going on?\u2019 \u2018Drink up,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018you\u2019ve got three pints to get through.\u2019 \u2018Three pints?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018At lunchtime?\u2019 The man next to Ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored him. He said, \u2018Time is an illusion. Lunch time doubly so.\u2019 \u2018Very deep,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018you should send that in to the Reader\u2019s Digest. They\u2019ve got a page for people like you.\u2019 \u2018Drink up.\u2019 \u2018Why three pints all of a sudden?\u2019 \u2018Muscle relaxant, you\u2019ll need it.\u2019 \u2018Muscle relaxant?\u2019 \u2018Muscle relaxant.\u2019 Arthur stared into his beer. \u2018Did I do anything wrong today,\u2019 he said, \u2018or has the world always been like this and I\u2019ve been too wrapped up in myself to notice?\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019ll try to explain. How long have we known each other?\u2019 \u2018How long?\u2019 Arthur thought. \u2018Er, about five years, maybe six,\u2019 he said. \u2018Most of it seemed to make some kind of sense at the time.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018How would you react if I said that I\u2019m not from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?\u2019 Arthur shrugged in a so so sort of way. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he said, taking a pull of beer. \u2018Why \u2013 do you think it\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019re likely to say?\u2019 Ford gave up. It really wasn\u2019t worth bothering at the moment, what with the world being about to end. He just said: \u2018Drink up.\u2019 He added, perfectly factually: \u2018The world\u2019s about to end.\u2019 Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of the pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business. \u2018This must be Thursday,\u2019 said Arthur to himself, sinking low over his beer, \u2018I never could get the hang of Thursdays.\u2019 3 On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office blocks, silent as birds. They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing. The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomers and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them \u2013 which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they\u2019d been looking for all these years. The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub Etha Sens O Matic which winked away quietly to itself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect habitually wore slung around his neck. The contents of Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were quite interesting, in fact, and would have made any earth physicist\u2019s eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top. Besides the Sub Etha Sens O Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb \u2013 a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator. This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million \u2018pages\u2019 could be summoned at a moment\u2019s notice. It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words DON\u2019T PANIC printed on it in large friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor \u2013 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in. Beneath that in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels. A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value \u2013 you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand to hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindbogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can\u2019t see it, it can\u2019t see you \u2013 daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough. More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit, etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have \u2018lost\u2019. What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still know where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with. Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in \u2018Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There\u2019s a frood who really knows where his towel is.\u2019 (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel, the Sub Etha Sens O Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea. \u2018You got a towel with you?\u2019 said Ford suddenly to Arthur. Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him. \u2018Why? What, no... should I have?\u2019 He had given up being surprised, there didn\u2019t seem to be any point any longer. Ford clicked his tongue in irritation. \u2018Drink up,\u2019 he urged. At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him. Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 he yelped. \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018they haven\u2019t started yet.\u2019 \u2018Thank God for that,\u2019 said Arthur and relaxed. \u2018It\u2019s probably just your house being knocked down,\u2019 said Ford, downing his last pint. \u2018What?\u2019 shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford\u2019s spell was broken. Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window. \u2018My God, they are! They\u2019re knocking my house down. What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford?\u2019 \u2018It hardly makes any difference at this stage,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018let them have their fun.\u2019 \u2018Fun?\u2019 yelped Arthur. \u2018Fun!\u2019 He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing. \u2018Damn their fun!\u2019 he shouted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime. \u2018Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!\u2019 bawled Arthur. \u2018You half crazed Visigoths, stop, will you!\u2019 Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts. \u2018There you are, sir,\u2019 said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, \u2018twenty eight pence if you\u2019d be so kind.\u2019 Ford was very kind \u2013 he gave the barman another five pound note and told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn\u2019t understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal. This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn\u2019t very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse. The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance. He didn\u2019t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe. \u2018Are you serious, sir?\u2019 he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub. \u2018You think the world\u2019s going to end?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018But, this afternoon?\u2019 Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said gaily, \u2018in less than two minutes, I would estimate.\u2019 The barman couldn\u2019t believe this conversation he was having, but he couldn\u2019t believe the sensation he had just had either. \u2018Isn\u2019t there anything we can do about it, then?\u2019 he said. \u2018No, nothing,\u2019 said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pocket. Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become. The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes weaved their way up to Ford. \u2018I thought,\u2019 he said \u2018that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.\u2019 \u2018If you like, yes,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018That\u2019s what they told us in the army,\u2019 said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back towards his whisky. \u2018Will that help?\u2019 asked the barman. \u2018No,\u2019 said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go.\u2019 With a wave, he left. The pub was silent for a moment longer and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it. The barman checked his throat. He heard himself say: \u2018Last orders, please.\u2019 The huge yellow machines began to sink downwards and to move faster. Ford knew they were there. This wasn\u2019t the way he had wanted it. Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He didn\u2019t notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn\u2019t notice the wind, he didn\u2019t notice the sudden irrational squall of rain. He didn\u2019t notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home. \u2018You barbarians!\u2019 he yelled. \u2018I\u2019ll sue the council for every penny it\u2019s got! I\u2019ll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And boiled... until... until... until you\u2019ve had enough.\u2019 Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast. \u2018And then I will do it again!\u2019 yelled Arthur. \u2018And when I\u2019ve finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!\u2019 Arthur didn\u2019t notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he didn\u2019t notice that Mr Prosser was staring hectically into the sky. What Mr Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds. Impossibly huge yellow somethings. \u2018And I will carry on jumping on them,\u2019 yelled Arthur, still running, \u2018until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then...\u2019 Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back. At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger shot upwards. \u2018What the hell\u2019s that?\u2019 he shrieked. Whatever it was raced across the sky in its monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with a mind buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull. Another one followed and did exactly the same thing only louder. It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense \u2013 running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit. Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub Etha Sens O Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillow and woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern, sitting alone in his small dark room, a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn\u2019t it just have to be the Vogons. Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: he wouldn\u2019t need them where he was going. Everything was ready, everything was prepared. He knew where his towel was. A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the noise. For a while nothing happened. The great ships hung motionless in the sky, over every nation on Earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don\u2019t. And still nothing happened. Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound. Every hi fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid range driver in the world quietly turned itself on. Every tin can, every dustbin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board. Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message. \u2018People of Earth, your attention please,\u2019 a voice said, and it was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep. \u2018This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council,\u2019 the voice continued. \u2018As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you.\u2019 The PA died away. Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth. The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron filings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to. Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said: \u2018There\u2019s no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you\u2019ve had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it\u2019s far too late to start making a fuss about it now.\u2019 The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black square. By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcast a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed back into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said: \u2018What do you mean you\u2019ve never been to Alpha Centauri? For Heavens\u2019s sake, mankind, it\u2019s only four light years away, you know. I\u2019m sorry, but if you can\u2019t be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that\u2019s your own lookout.\u2019 \u2018Energize the demolition beams.\u2019 Light poured out of the hatchways. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said the voice on the PA, \u2018apathetic bloody planet, I\u2019ve no sympathy at all.\u2019 It cut off. There was a terrible ghastly silence. There was a terrible ghastly noise. There was a terrible ghastly silence. The Vogon Constructor Fleet coasted away into the inky starry void. 4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun. Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of. Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold. The boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before it reached its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean. The boat sped on. Because of this topographical awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold project was so secret. The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence \u2013 in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France. One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences. But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent shock waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy \u2013 Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas. Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed. Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. President? No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least. Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was ideal presidency fodder.* What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it. He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun. Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence. As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily along the seat back. He steered with an extra arm he\u2019d recently had fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski boxing. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he cooed to himself, \u2018you\u2019re a real cool boy, you.\u2019 But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle. The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore. On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee. It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold \u2013 mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green sylph like maximegalaticians, an octopodic physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super intelligent shade of the colour blue). All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi coloured ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion. There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck. (An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference to them if they\u2019d known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it. Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job. The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seamanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns. In fact it didn\u2019t need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms \u2013 but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water. They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes in the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming in the boat\u2019s wake as it careered across the bay. Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at. He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves. Within seconds he ran out on to the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people. The three billion people weren\u2019t actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri D: that\u2019s what they were for. He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn\u2019t know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for. The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His tousled fair hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven. A twenty foot high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it floated a wide semi circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all done for effect as much as anything. Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa. He spread his two arms along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might scream. Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff. Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below. Zaphod smiled, picturing himself. A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one. At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt. To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light. The President of the Galaxy had arrived. He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hand in greeting. \u2018Hi,\u2019 he said. A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it. Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider. \u2018Hi,\u2019 he said again. Everyone beamed at him, or at least, nearly everyone. He singled out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab, of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from Damogran. Trillian wasn\u2019t anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him. \u2018Hi, honey,\u2019 he said to her. She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly \u2013 but by this time he was looking at something else. \u2018Hi,\u2019 he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote. The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they\u2019d built it that way. Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindbogglingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain wrenching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named \u2013 the Heart of Gold. \u2018Wow,\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn\u2019t much else he could say. He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press. \u2018Wow.\u2019 The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He winked at Trillian, who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible show off. \u2018That is really amazing,\u2019 he said. \u2018That really is truly amazing. That is so amazingly amazing I think I\u2019d like to steal it.\u2019 A marvellous presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub Etha News Matics and the President grinned. As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket. Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen beaming smiles. 5 Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects. Not that he ever went swimming, of course. His busy schedule would not allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet\u2019s virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again: they should never have survived. The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick willed slug brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution? they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery. Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vog sphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees of breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burnt the crab meat with; elegant gazelle like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on. They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway. Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy, and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears. Every year they import twenty seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitchhikers. Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz\u2019s flagship, a small match flared nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous. His name was Ford Prefect.* He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they kept themselves very much to themselves. This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon. It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out. He ripped it open and shook it. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again. Ford Prefect said: \u2018I bought some peanuts.\u2019 Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently. \u2018Here, have some,\u2019 urged Ford, shaking the packet again, \u2018if you\u2019ve never been through a matter transference beam before you\u2019ve probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit.\u2019 \u2018Whhhrrrr...\u2019 said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. \u2018It\u2019s dark,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford Prefect. \u2018It\u2019s dark.\u2019 \u2018No light,\u2019 said Arthur Dent. \u2018Dark, no light.\u2019 One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in It\u2019s a nice day, or You\u2019re very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty foot well, are you all right? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months\u2019 consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If they don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn\u2019t know about. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he agreed with Arthur, \u2018no light.\u2019 He helped Arthur to some peanuts. \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 he asked him. \u2018Like a military academy,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018bits of me keep on passing out.\u2019 Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness. \u2018If I asked you where the hell we were,\u2019 said Arthur weakly, \u2018would I regret it?\u2019 Ford stood up. \u2018We\u2019re safe,\u2019 he said. \u2018Oh good,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018We\u2019re in a small galley cabin,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn\u2019t previously aware of.\u2019 Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch. Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing. \u2018How did we get here?\u2019 he asked, shivering slightly. \u2018We hitched a lift,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Excuse me?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bugeyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in, I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the Thumb\u2019s an electronic sub etha signalling device, the roundabout\u2019s at Barnard\u2019s Star six light years away, but otherwise, that\u2019s more or less right.\u2019 \u2018And the bug eyed monster?\u2019 \u2018Is green, yes.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018when can I go home?\u2019 \u2018You can\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch. \u2018Shade your eyes...\u2019 he said, and turned it on. Even Ford was surprised. \u2018Good grief,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018is this really the interior of a flying saucer?\u2019 Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak. \u2018Go away!\u2019 he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn\u2019t now be him who delivered the report they\u2019d just received. The report was an official release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary. Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn\u2019t shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome. A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray. It was grinning like a maniac. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about. Ford and Arthur stared around them. \u2018Well, what do you think?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It\u2019s a bit squalid, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Ford frowned at the grubby mattresses, unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin. \u2018Well, this is a working ship, you see,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018These are the Dentrassi sleeping quarters.\u2019 \u2018I thought you said they were called Vogons or something.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks, they let us on board.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m confused,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Here, have a look at this,\u2019 said Ford. He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Sqornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to life again. Ford handed the book to Arthur. \u2018What is it?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. It\u2019s a sort of electronic book. It tells you everything you need to know about anything. That\u2019s its job.\u2019 Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands. \u2018I like the cover,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t Panic. It\u2019s the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody\u2019s said to me all day.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll show you how it works,\u2019 said Ford. He snatched it from Arthur who was still holding it as if it was a two week dead lark and pulled it out of its cover. \u2018You press this button here, you see, and the screen lights up giving you the index.\u2019 A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to flicker across the surface. \u2018You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so.\u2019 His fingers tapped some more keys. \u2018And there we are.\u2019 The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen. Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice. This is what the book said. \u2018Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy \u2013 not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn\u2019t even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters. \u2018The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. \u2018On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.\u2019 Arthur blinked at it. \u2018What a strange book. How did we get a lift, then?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the point, it\u2019s out of date now,\u2019 said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover. \u2018I\u2019m doing the field research for the new revised edition, and one of the things I\u2019ll have to do is include a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks, which gives us a rather useful little loophole.\u2019 A pained expression crossed Arthur\u2019s face. \u2018But who are the Dentrassi?\u2019 he said. \u2018Great guys,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018They\u2019re the best cooks and the best drinks mixers and they don\u2019t give a wet slap about anything else. And they\u2019ll always help hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you\u2019re an impoverished hitchhiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairian dollars a day. And that\u2019s my job. Fun, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Arthur looked lost. \u2018It\u2019s amazing,\u2019 he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses. \u2018Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years.\u2019 \u2018But how did you get there in the first place, then?\u2019 \u2018Easy, I got a lift with a teaser.\u2019 \u2018A teaser?\u2019 \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Er, what is...\u2019 \u2018A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They cruise around looking for planets which haven\u2019t made interstellar contact yet and buzz them.\u2019 \u2018Buzz them?\u2019 Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018they buzz them. They find some isolated spot with very few people around, then land right by some poor unsuspecting soul whom no one\u2019s ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their head and making beep beep noises. Rather childish really.\u2019 Ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself. \u2018Ford,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018I don\u2019t know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here?\u2019 \u2018Well, you know that,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I rescued you from the Earth.\u2019 \u2018And what\u2019s happened to the Earth?\u2019 \u2018Ah. It\u2019s been demolished.\u2019 \u2018Has it?\u2019 said Arthur levelly. \u2018Yes. It just boiled away into space.\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019m a bit upset about that.\u2019 Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind. \u2018Yes, I can understand that,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018Understand that!\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018Understand that!\u2019 Ford sprang up. \u2018Keep looking at the book!\u2019 he hissed urgently. \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t Panic.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not panicking!\u2019 \u2018Yes you are.\u2019 \u2018All right, so I\u2019m panicking, what else is there to do?\u2019 \u2018You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy\u2019s a fun place. You\u2019ll need to have this fish in your ear.\u2019 \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 asked Arthur, rather politely he thought. Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him. He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of. He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Sqornshellous mattresses and the man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of cornflakes. But he couldn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t feel safe. Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he could identify. He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves. \u2018Shush!\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Listen, it might be important.\u2019 \u2018Im... important?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the Vogon captain making an announcement on the Tannoy.\u2019 \u2018You mean that\u2019s how the Vogons talk?\u2019 \u2018Listen!\u2019 \u2018But I can\u2019t speak Vogon!\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t need to. Just put this fish in your ear.\u2019 Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur\u2019s ear, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish slithering deep into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned goggle eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick. Or of looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new pair of glasses. He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only now it had somehow taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward English. This is what he heard... 6 \u2018Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you\u2019re doing and pay attention. First of all I see from our instruments that we have a couple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello, wherever you are. I just want to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome. I worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn\u2019t become captain of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi service for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent out a search party, and as soon as they find you I will put you off the ship. If you\u2019re very lucky I might read you some of my poetry first. \u2018Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey to Barnard\u2019s Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a seventy two hour refit, and no one\u2019s to leave the ship during that time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. I\u2019ve just had an unhappy love affair, so I don\u2019t see why anybody else should have a good time. Message ends.\u2019 The noise stopped. Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his head. He smiled weakly. \u2018Charming man,\u2019 he said. \u2018I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one...\u2019 \u2018You wouldn\u2019t need to,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018They\u2019ve got as much sex appeal as a road accident. No, don\u2019t move,\u2019 he added as Arthur began to uncurl himself, \u2018you\u2019d better be prepared for the jump into hyperspace. It\u2019s unpleasantly like being drunk.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s so unpleasant about being drunk?\u2019 \u2018You ask a glass of water.\u2019 Arthur thought about this. \u2018Ford,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s this fish doing in my ear?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s translating for you. It\u2019s a Babel fish. Look it up in the book if you like.\u2019 He tossed over The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy and then curled up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the jump. At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur\u2019s mind. His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. The room folded flat around him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel. They were passing through hyperspace. \u2018The Babel fish,\u2019 said The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy quietly, \u2018is small, yellow and leech like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brain wave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish. \u2018Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non existence of God. \u2018The argument goes something like this: \u201cI refuse to prove that I exist,\u201d says God, \u201cfor proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.\u201d \u2018 \u201cBut,\u201d says Man, \u201cthe Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn\u2019t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don\u2019t. QED.\u201d \u2018 \u201cOh dear,\u201d says God, \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic. \u2018 \u201cOh, that was easy,\u201d says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing. \u2018Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo\u2019s kidneys, but that didn\u2019t stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God. \u2018Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.\u2019 Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the kick through hyperspace hadn\u2019t killed him. He was now six light years from the place that the Earth would have been if it still existed. The Earth. Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket two days before and felt a sudden stab \u2013 the supermarket was gone, everyone in it was gone. Nelson\u2019s Column had gone! Nelson\u2019s Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson\u2019s Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind \u2013 his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him. England no longer existed. He\u2019d got that \u2013 somehow he\u2019d got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn\u2019t grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He\u2019d never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, has sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonald\u2019s, he thought. There is no longer any such thing as a McDonald\u2019s hamburger. He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother. He jerked himself violently to his feet. \u2018Ford!\u2019 Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to himself. He always found the actual travelling through space part of space travel rather trying. \u2018Yeah?\u2019 he said. \u2018If you\u2019re a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth, you must have been gathering material on it.\u2019 \u2018Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes.\u2019 \u2018Let me see what it says in this edition, then. I\u2019ve got to see it.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, OK.\u2019 He passed it over again. Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He pressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it. \u2018It doesn\u2019t have an entry!\u2019 he burst out. Ford looked over his shoulder. \u2018Yes it does,\u2019 he said, \u2018down there, see at the bottom of the screen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six.\u2019 Arthur followed Ford\u2019s finger, and saw where it was pointing. For a moment it still didn\u2019t register, then his mind nearly blew up. \u2018What? Harmless! Is that all it\u2019s got to say? Harmless! One word!\u2019 Ford shrugged. \u2018Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only a limited amount of space in the book\u2019s microprocessors,\u2019 he said, \u2018and no one knew much about the Earth, of course.\u2019 \u2018Well, for God\u2019s sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the editor. He had to trim it a bit, but it\u2019s still an improvement.\u2019 \u2018And what does it say now?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Mostly harmless,\u2019 admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed cough. \u2018Mostly harmless,\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018What was that noise?\u2019 hissed Ford. \u2018It was me shouting,\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018No! Shut up!\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I think we\u2019re in trouble.\u2019 \u2018You think we\u2019re in trouble!\u2019 Outside the door were the clear sounds of marching footsteps. \u2018The Dentrassi?\u2019 whispered Arthur. \u2018No, those are steel tipped boots,\u2019 said Ford. There was a sharp ringing rap on the door. \u2018Then who is it?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018if we\u2019re lucky it\u2019s just the Vogons come to throw us in to space.\u2019 \u2018And if we\u2019re unlucky?\u2019 \u2018If we\u2019re unlucky,\u2019 said Ford grimly, \u2018the captain might be serious in his threat that he\u2019s going to read us some of his poetry first...\u2019 7 Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe. The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem \u2018Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\u2019 four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos is reported to have been \u2018disappointed\u2019 by the poem\u2019s reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in the destruction of the planet Earth. Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence of muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at his prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a little callousness. The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation chairs \u2013 strapped in. Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been part of a bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness. The sweat stood out on Ford Prefect\u2019s brow, and slid round the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a battery of electronic equipment \u2013 imagery intensifiers, rhythmic modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers \u2013 all designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure that not a single nuance of the poet\u2019s thought was lost. Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for, but he knew that he hadn\u2019t liked anything that had happened so far and didn\u2019t think things were likely to change. The Vogon began to read \u2013 a fetid little passage of his own devising. \u2018O freddled gruntbuggly...\u2019 he began. Spasms racked Ford\u2019s body \u2013 this was worse than even he\u2019d been prepared for. \u2018... thy micturations are to me / As plurdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee.\u2019 \u2018Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!\u2019 went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his teeth. \u2018Groop, I implore thee,\u2019 continued the merciless Vogon, \u2018my foonting turlingdromes.\u2019 His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned stridency. \u2018And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles, / Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheon, see if I don\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Nnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhh!\u2019 cried Ford Prefect and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp. Arthur lolled. \u2018Now, Earthlings...\u2019 whirred the Vogon (he didn\u2019t know that Ford Prefect was in fact from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, and wouldn\u2019t have cared if he had), \u2018I present you with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or...\u2019 he paused for melodramatic effect, \u2018tell me how good you thought my poem was!\u2019 He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat shaped seat and watched them. He did the smile again. Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his parched mouth and moaned. Arthur said brightly: \u2018Actually I quite liked it.\u2019 Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply not occurred to him. The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured his nose and was therefore no bad thing. \u2018Oh good...\u2019 he whirred, in considerable astonishment. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I thought that some of the metaphysical imagery was really particularly effective.\u2019 Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts around this totally new concept. Were they really going to be able to bareface their way out of this? \u2018Yes, do continue...\u2019 invited the Vogon. \u2018Oh... and er... interesting rhythmic devices too,\u2019 continued Arthur, \u2018which seemed to counterpoint the... er... er...\u2019 he floundered. Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding \u2018... counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the... er...\u2019 He floundered too, but Arthur was ready again. \u2018... humanity of the...\u2019 \u2018Vogonity,\u2019 Ford hissed at him. \u2018Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet\u2019s compassionate soul,\u2019 Arthur felt he was on a home stretch now, \u2018which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this, transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental dichotomies of the other,\u2019 (he was reaching a triumphant crescendo...) \u2018and one is left with a profound and vivid insight into... into... er...\u2019 (... which suddenly gave out on him). Ford leaped in with the coup de gr\u00e2ce: \u2018Into whatever it was the poem was about!\u2019 he yelled. Out of the corner of his mouth: \u2018Well done, Arthur, that was very good.\u2019 The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul had been touched, but he thought no \u2013 too little too late. His voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon. \u2018So what you\u2019re saying is that I write poetry because underneath my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be loved,\u2019 he said. He paused. \u2018Is that right?\u2019 Ford laughed a nervous laugh. \u2018Well, I mean, yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018don\u2019t we all, deep down, know... er...\u2019 The Vogon stood up. \u2018No, well you\u2019re completely wrong,\u2019 he said. \u2018I just write poetry to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief. I\u2019m going to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the prisoners to number three airlock and throw them out!\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 shouted Ford. A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of their straps with his huge blubbery arms. \u2018You can\u2019t throw us into space,\u2019 yelled Ford, \u2018we\u2019re trying to write a book.\u2019 \u2018Resistance is useless!\u2019 shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It was the first phrase he\u2019d learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard Corps. The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away. Arthur stared round him wildly. \u2018I don\u2019t want to die now!\u2019 he yelled. \u2018I\u2019ve still got a headache! I don\u2019t want to go to heaven with a headache, I\u2019d be all cross and wouldn\u2019t enjoy it!\u2019 The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing deferentially towards his captain\u2019s back, hoiked them both protesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain was on his own again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself, lightly fingering his notebook of verses. \u2018Hmmm,\u2019 he said, \u2018counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor...\u2019 He considered this for a moment, and then closed the book with a grim smile. \u2018Death\u2019s too good for them,\u2019 he said. The long steel lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of the two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits. \u2018This is great,\u2019 spluttered Arthur, \u2018this is really terrific. Let go of me, you brute!\u2019 The Vogon guard dragged them on. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019ll think of something.\u2019 He didn\u2019t sound hopeful. \u2018Resistance is useless!\u2019 bellowed the guard. \u2018Just don\u2019t say things like that,\u2019 stammered Ford. \u2018How can anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you\u2019re saying things like that?\u2019 \u2018My God,\u2019 complained Arthur, \u2018you\u2019re talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven\u2019t even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I\u2019d have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It\u2019s now just after four in the afternoon and I\u2019m already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\u2019 He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018just stop panicking!\u2019 \u2018Who said anything about panicking?\u2019 snapped Arthur. \u2018This is still just the culture shock. You wait till I\u2019ve settled down into the situation and found my bearings. Then I\u2019ll start panicking!\u2019 \u2018Arthur, you\u2019re getting hysterical. Shut up!\u2019 Ford tried desperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting again. \u2018Resistance is useless!\u2019 \u2018And you can shut up as well!\u2019 snapped Ford. \u2018Resistance is useless!\u2019 \u2018Oh, give it a rest,\u2019 said Ford. He twisted his head till he was looking straight up into his captor\u2019s face. A thought struck him. \u2018Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?\u2019 he asked suddenly. The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped slowly over his face. \u2018Enjoy?\u2019 he boomed. \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 \u2018What I mean,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018is does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships...\u2019 The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he said, \u2018Well, the hours are good...\u2019 \u2018They\u2019d have to be,\u2019 agreed Ford. Arthur twisted his head round to look at Ford. \u2018Ford, what are you doing?\u2019 he asked in an amazed whisper. \u2018Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?\u2019 he said. \u2018So the hours are pretty good, then?\u2019 he resumed. The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except...\u2019 he thought again, which required looking at the ceiling \u2013 \u2018except some of the shouting I quite like.\u2019 He filled his lungs and bellowed, \u2018Resistance is\u2014\u2019 \u2018Sure, yes,\u2019 interrupted Ford hurriedly, \u2018you\u2019re good at that, I can tell. But if it\u2019s mostly lousy,\u2019 he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their mark, \u2018then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?\u2019 Arthur looked backwards and forwards between them in bafflement. \u2018Er...\u2019 said the guard, \u2018er... er... I dunno. I think I just sort of... do it, really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a good career for a young Vogon \u2013 you know, the uniform, the low slung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium...\u2019 \u2018There you are, Arthur,\u2019 said Ford with the air of someone reaching the conclusion of his argument, \u2018you think you\u2019ve got problems.\u2019 Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet the Vogon guard had half throttled him already and he didn\u2019t like the sound of being thrown into space very much. \u2018Try and understand his problem,\u2019 insisted Ford. \u2018Here he is, poor lad, his entire life\u2019s work is stamping around, throwing people off spaceships...\u2019 \u2018And shouting,\u2019 added the guard. \u2018And shouting, sure,\u2019 said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly condescension, \u2018... and he doesn\u2019t even know why he\u2019s doing it!\u2019 Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxiated to speak. Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard. \u2018Well. Now you put it like that, I suppose...\u2019 \u2018Good lad,\u2019 encouraged Ford. \u2018But all right,\u2019 went on the rumblings, \u2018so what\u2019s the alternative?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, brightly but slowly, \u2018stop doing it of course! Tell them,\u2019 he went on, \u2018you\u2019re not going to do it any more.\u2019 He felt he ought to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much. \u2018Eerrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\u2019 said the guard, \u2018erm, well, that doesn\u2019t sound that great to me.\u2019 Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away. \u2018Now wait a minute,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s just the start, you see, there\u2019s more to it than that, you see...\u2019 But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was obviously quite touched. \u2018No, I think if it\u2019s all the same to you,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019d better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I\u2019ve got to do.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t all the same to Ford Prefect at all. \u2018Come on now... but look!\u2019 he said, less slowly, less brightly. \u2018Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnn...\u2019 said Arthur without any clear inflection. \u2018But hang on,\u2019 pursued Ford, \u2018there\u2019s music and art and things to tell you about yet! Arrggghhh!\u2019 \u2018Resistance is useless,\u2019 bellowed the guard, and then added, \u2018You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren\u2019t usually many vacancies for non shouting and non pushing people about officers, so I think I\u2019d better stick to what I know.\u2019 They had now reached the airlock \u2013 a large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft. The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open. \u2018But thanks for taking an interest,\u2019 said the Vogon guard. \u2018Bye now.\u2019 He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the reclosing hatchway. \u2018But listen,\u2019 he shouted to the guard, \u2018there\u2019s a whole world you don\u2019t know anything about... here how about this?\u2019 Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand \u2013 he hummed the first bar of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth. \u2018Da da da dum! Doesn\u2019t that stir anything in you?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the guard, \u2018not really. But I\u2019ll mention it to my aunt.\u2019 If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost bar the faint distant hum of the ship\u2019s engines. They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long. Ford looked round it, panting. \u2018Potentially bright lad I thought,\u2019 he said and slumped against the curved wall. Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had fallen. He didn\u2019t look up. He just lay panting. \u2018We\u2019re trapped now, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we\u2019re trapped.\u2019 \u2018Well, didn\u2019t you think of anything? I thought you said you were going to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and I didn\u2019t notice.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, I thought of something,\u2019 panted Ford. Arthur looked up expectantly. \u2018But unfortunately,\u2019 continued Ford, \u2018it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway.\u2019 He kicked the hatch they\u2019d just been thrown through. \u2018But it was a good idea, was it?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, very neat.\u2019 \u2018What was it?\u2019 \u2018Well I hadn\u2019t worked out the details yet. Not much point now, is there?\u2019 \u2018So... er, what happens next?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and asphyxiate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds, of course...\u2019 said Ford. He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur\u2019s eyes he suddenly looked very alien. \u2018So this is it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we are going to die.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018except... no! Wait a minute!\u2019 He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur\u2019s line of vision. \u2018What\u2019s this switch?\u2019 he cried. \u2018What? Where?\u2019 cried Arthur, twisting round. \u2018No, I was only fooling,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we are going to die after all.\u2019 He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he had left off. \u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s at times like this, when I\u2019m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space, that I really wish I\u2019d listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\u2019 \u2018Why, what did she tell you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t listen.\u2019 \u2018Oh.\u2019 Ford carried on humming. \u2018This is terrific,\u2019 Arthur thought to himself, \u2018Nelson\u2019s Column has gone, McDonald\u2019s have gone, all that\u2019s left is me and the words Mostly harmless. Any second now all that will be left is Mostly harmless. And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well.\u2019 A motor whirred. A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped out into space like corks from a toy gun. 8 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships. It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers. The introduction begins like this: \u2018Space,\u2019 it says, \u2018is big. Really big. You just won\u2019t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it\u2019s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that\u2019s just peanuts to space. Listen...\u2019 and so on. (After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory there it is vitally important to get a receipt.) To be fair, though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of the distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide\u2019s introduction have faltered. Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in Reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts. The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination. Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes to journey from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol\u2019s nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima. For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand years. The record for hitchhiking this distance is just under five years, but you don\u2019t get to see much on the way. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds. However, it does go on to say that what with space being the mindboggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and seventy six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against. By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with \u2013 she went off with a gatecrasher. Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued. 9 A computer chattered to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason. This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch. A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of millions of light years from end to end. As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three foot high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxiation, partly of surprise. Two hundred and thirty nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing in a large wobbly heap on the famine struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system. The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later. The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion. Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary about the patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to. That was how life began in the Universe. Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement. On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half spent fish. \u2018There you are,\u2019 gasped Ford, scrabbling for a finger hold on the pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, \u2018I told you I\u2019d think of something.\u2019 \u2018Oh sure,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018sure.\u2019 \u2018Bright idea of mine,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it.\u2019 The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal light exploded, splattering space\u2013time as with gobbets of junket. Time blossomed, matter shrank away. The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever. \u2018Oh, come off it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018the chances against it were astronomical.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t knock it, it worked,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What sort of ship are we in?\u2019 asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I haven\u2019t opened my eyes yet.\u2019 \u2018No, nor have I,\u2019 said Arthur. The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions. Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise. \u2018Good God,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it looks just like the sea front at Southend.\u2019 \u2018Hell, I\u2019m relieved to hear you say that,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Because I thought I must be going mad.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it.\u2019 Ford thought about this. \u2018Well, did you say it or didn\u2019t you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018I think so,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Well, perhaps we\u2019re both going mad.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we\u2019d be mad, all things considered, to think this was Southend.\u2019 \u2018Well, do you think this is Southend?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes.\u2019 \u2018So do I.\u2019 \u2018Therefore we must be mad.\u2019 \u2018Nice day for it.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said a passing maniac. \u2018Who was that?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Who \u2013 the man with the five heads and the elder berry bush full of kippers?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. Just someone.\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the Uncertain Areas. \u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur with a slight cough, \u2018if this is Southend, there\u2019s something very odd about it...\u2019 \u2018You mean the way the sea stays steady as a rock and the buildings keep washing up and down?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yes, I thought that was odd too. In fact,\u2019 he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal segments which danced and spun giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formations, \u2018there is something altogether very strange going on.\u2019 Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it. They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard a girl\u2019s voice. It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, \u2018Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling,\u2019 and that was all. Ford skidded down a beam of light and spun round trying to find a source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in. \u2018What was that voice?\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 yelled Ford. \u2018I don\u2019t know. It sounded like a measurement of probability.\u2019 \u2018Probability? What do you mean?\u2019 \u2018Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to four against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against. That\u2019s pretty improbable, you know.\u2019 A million gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without warning. \u2018But what does it mean?\u2019 cried Arthur. \u2018What, the custard?\u2019 \u2018No, the measurement of improbability!\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know at all. I think we\u2019re on some kind of spaceship.\u2019 \u2018I can only assume,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that this is not the first class compartment.\u2019 Bulges appeared in the fabric of space\u2013time. Great ugly bulges. \u2018Haaaauuurrgghhh...\u2019 said Arthur as he felt his body softening and bending in unusual directions. \u2018Southend seems to be melting away... the stars are swirling... a dust bowl... my legs are drifting off into the sunset... my left arm\u2019s come off too.\u2019 A frightening thought struck him: \u2018Hell,\u2019 he said, \u2018how am I going to operate my digital watch now?\u2019 He wound his eyes desperately around to Ford\u2019s direction. \u2018Ford,\u2019 he said, \u2018you\u2019re turning into a penguin. Stop it.\u2019 Again came the voice. \u2018Two to the power of seventy five thousand to one against and falling.\u2019 Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle. \u2018Hey, who are you?\u2019 he quacked. \u2018Where are you? What\u2019s going on and is there any way of stopping it?\u2019 \u2018Please relax,\u2019 said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, \u2018you are perfectly safe.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s not the point!\u2019 raged Ford. \u2018The point is that I am now a perfectly safe penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve got them back now,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling,\u2019 said the voice. \u2018Admittedly,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018they\u2019re longer than I usually like them, but...\u2019 \u2018Isn\u2019t there anything,\u2019 squawked Ford in avian fury, \u2018you feel you ought to be telling us?\u2019 The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off into the distance. \u2018Welcome,\u2019 the voice said, \u2018to the Starship Heart of Gold.\u2019 The voice continued. \u2018Please do not be alarmed,\u2019 it said, \u2018by anything you see or hear around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power of two hundred and seventy six thousand to one against \u2013 possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of two to the power of twenty five thousand to one against and falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of twenty thousand to one against and falling.\u2019 The voice cut out. Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle. Ford was wildly excited. \u2018Arthur!\u2019 he said. \u2018This is fantastic! We\u2019ve been picked up by a ship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is incredible! I heard rumours about it before! They were all officially denied, but they must have done it! They\u2019ve built the Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is... Arthur? What\u2019s happening?\u2019 Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers were inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely. Arthur looked up. \u2018Ford,\u2019 he said, \u2018there\u2019s an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they\u2019ve worked out.\u2019 10 The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace. It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government\u2019s research team on Damogran. This, briefly, is the story of its discovery. The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood \u2013 and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess\u2019s undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy. Many respectable physicists said that they weren\u2019t going to stand for this \u2013 partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn\u2019t get invited to those sort of parties. Another thing they couldn\u2019t stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible. Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea... and turn it on! He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden infinite improbability generator out of thin air. It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute\u2019s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn\u2019t stand was a smartass. 11 The improbability proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats hadn\u2019t had the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish restaurant. In fact it wasn\u2019t perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners of the cabin were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes. The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three dimensional oblong room, but then the designers would have got miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees. It too was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn\u2019t quite fit properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better. Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement. Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off figures. Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the whole ship. \u2018Five to one against and falling...\u2019 she said, \u2018four to one against and falling... three to one... two... one... probability factor of one to one... we have normality, I repeat we have normality.\u2019 She turned her microphone off \u2013 then turned it back on with a slight smile and continued: \u2018Anything you still can\u2019t cope with is therefore your own problem. Please relax. You will be sent for soon.\u2019 Zaphod burst out in annoyance: \u2018Who are they, Trillian?\u2019 Trillian spun her seat round to face him and shrugged. \u2018Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space,\u2019 she said. \u2018Section ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well, that\u2019s a very sweet thought, Trillian,\u2019 complained Zaphod, \u2018but do you really think it\u2019s wise under the circumstances? I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we must have the police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we stop to pick up hitchhikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?\u2019 He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved his hand before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zaphod\u2019s qualities of mind might include \u2013 dash, bravado, conceit \u2013 he was mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main reason why he had had such a wild and successful life was that he never really understood the significance of anything he did. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 she said patiently, \u2018they were floating unprotected in open space... you wouldn\u2019t want them to have died, would you?\u2019 \u2018Well, you know... no. Not as such, but...\u2019 \u2018Not as such? Not die as such? But?\u2019 Trillian cocked her head on one side. \u2018Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later.\u2019 \u2018A second later and they would have been dead.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, so if you\u2019d taken the trouble to think about the problem a bit longer it would have gone away.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019d have been happy to let them die?\u2019 \u2018Well, you know, not happy as such, but...\u2019 \u2018Anyway,\u2019 said Trillian, turning back to the controls, \u2018I didn\u2019t pick them up.\u2019 \u2018What do you mean? Who picked them up, then?\u2019 \u2018The ship did.\u2019 \u2018Huh?\u2019 \u2018The ship did. All by itself.\u2019 \u2018Huh?\u2019 \u2018Whilst we were in Improbability Drive.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s incredible.\u2019 \u2018No, Zaphod. Just very very improbable.\u2019 \u2018Er, yeah.\u2019 \u2018Look, Zaphod,\u2019 she said, patting his arm, \u2018don\u2019t worry about the aliens. They\u2019re just a couple of guys I expect. I\u2019ll send the robot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey, Marvin!\u2019 In the corner, the robot\u2019s head swung up sharply, but then wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as if it was about five pounds heavier than it actually was, and made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and seemed to stare through her left shoulder. \u2018I think you ought to know I\u2019m feeling very depressed,\u2019 it said. Its voice was low and hopeless. \u2018Oh God,\u2019 muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, \u2018here\u2019s something to occupy you and keep your mind off things.\u2019 \u2018It won\u2019t work,\u2019 droned Marvin, \u2018I have an exceptionally large mind.\u2019 \u2018Marvin!\u2019 warned Trillian. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018what do you want me to do?\u2019 \u2018Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here under surveillance.\u2019 With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation of pitch and timbre \u2013 nothing you could actually take offence at \u2013 Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all things human. \u2018Just that?\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Trillian firmly. \u2018I won\u2019t enjoy it,\u2019 said Marvin. Zaphod leapt out of his seat. \u2018She\u2019s not asking you to enjoy it,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018just do it, will you?\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell, \u2018I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 \u2018Good...\u2019 snapped Zaphod, \u2018great... thank you...\u2019 Marvin turned and lifted his flat topped triangular red eyes up towards him. \u2018I\u2019m not getting you down at all, am I?\u2019 he said pathetically. \u2018No, no, Marvin,\u2019 lilted Trillian, \u2018that\u2019s just fine, really...\u2019 \u2018I wouldn\u2019t like to think I was getting you down.\u2019 \u2018No, don\u2019t worry about that,\u2019 the lilt continued, \u2018you just act as comes naturally and everything will be just fine.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u2019 probed Marvin. \u2018No, no, Marvin,\u2019 lilted Trillian, \u2018that\u2019s just fine, really... just part of life.\u2019 Marvin flashed her an electronic look. \u2018Life,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018don\u2019t talk to me about life.\u2019 He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind him. \u2018I don\u2019t think I can stand that robot much longer, Zaphod,\u2019 growled Trillian. The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as \u2018Your Plastic Pal Who\u2019s Fun To Be With\u2019. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as \u2018a bunch of mindless jerks who\u2019ll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes\u2019, with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent. Curiously enough, an edition of The Encyclopaedia Galactica that had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as \u2018a bunch of mindless jerks who were the first against the wall when the revolution came\u2019. The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart. \u2018I think this ship\u2019s brand new,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018How can you tell?\u2019 asked Arthur. \u2018Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?\u2019 \u2018No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It\u2019s a lot of \u201cthe Universe can be yours\u201d stuff. Ah! Look, I was right.\u2019 Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur. \u2018It says: \u201cSensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics. As soon as the ship\u2019s drive reaches Infinite Improbability it passes through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other major governments.\u201d Wow, this is big league stuff.\u2019 Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship, occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read \u2013 clearly Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his exile. Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his mind wander. Trailing his fingers along the edge of an incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words Please do not press this button again. He shook himself. \u2018Listen,\u2019 said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales brochure, \u2018they make a big thing of the ship\u2019s cybernetics. A new generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and computers, with the new GPP feature.\u2019 \u2018GPP feature?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 \u2018Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018sounds ghastly.\u2019 A voice behind them said, \u2018It is.\u2019 The voice was low and hopeless and accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They spun round and saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway. \u2018What?\u2019 they said. \u2018Ghastly,\u2019 continued Marvin, \u2018it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just don\u2019t even talk about it. Look at this door,\u2019 he said stepping through it. The irony circuits cut in to his voice modulator as he mimicked the style of the sales brochure. \u2018All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done.\u2019 As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did indeed have a satisfied sigh like quality to it. \u2018Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!\u2019 it said. Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing physical violence against it. Further circuits cut in saying, Why bother? What\u2019s the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in. Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular components of the door, and of the humanoids\u2019 brain cells. For a quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in boredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot\u2019s body as he turned. \u2018Come on,\u2019 he droned, \u2018I\u2019ve been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? \u2019Cos I don\u2019t.\u2019 He turned and walked back to the hated door. \u2018Er, excuse me,\u2019 said Ford following after him, \u2018which government owns this ship?\u2019 Marvin ignored him. \u2018You watch this door,\u2019 he muttered, \u2018it\u2019s about to open again. I can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly generates.\u2019 With an ingratiating little whine the door slid open again and Marvin stomped through. \u2018Come on,\u2019 he said. The others followed quickly and the door slid back into place with pleased little clicks and whirrs. \u2018Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation,\u2019 said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming curved corridor that stretched out before them. \u2018 \u201cLet\u2019s build robots with Genuine People Personalities,\u201d they said. So they tried it out with me. I\u2019m a personality prototype. You can tell, can\u2019t you?\u2019 Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers. \u2018I hate that door,\u2019 continued Marvin. \u2018I\u2019m not getting you down at all, am I?\u2019 \u2018Which government...\u2019 started Ford again. \u2018No government owns it,\u2019 snapped the robot, \u2018it\u2019s been stolen.\u2019 \u2018Stolen?\u2019 \u2018Stolen?\u2019 mimicked Marvin. \u2018Who by?\u2019 asked Ford. \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox.\u2019 Something extraordinary happened to Ford\u2019s face. At least five entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid stride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. He stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles. \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox...\u2019 he said weakly. \u2018Sorry, did I say something wrong?\u2019 said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. \u2018Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don\u2019t know why I bother to say it, oh God I\u2019m so depressed. Here\u2019s another of those self satisfied doors. Life! Don\u2019t talk to me about life.\u2019 \u2018No one even mentioned it,\u2019 muttered Arthur irritably. \u2018Ford, are you all right?\u2019 Ford stared at him. \u2018Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?\u2019 he said. 12 A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold cabin as Zaphod searched the sub etha radio wavebands for news of himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the controls were made touch sensitive \u2013 you merely had to brush the panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to the same programme. Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement. The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the music. \u2018... and news reports brought to you here on the sub etha waveband, broadcasting around the Galaxy around the clock,\u2019 squawked a voice, \u2018and we\u2019ll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life forms everywhere... and to everyone else out there, the secret is to bang the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news story tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox. And the question everyone\u2019s asking is... Has the Big Z finally flipped? Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex confidence trickster, once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and recently voted the Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe for the seventh time... has he got an answer this time? We asked his private brain case specialist, Gag Halfrunt...\u2019 The music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in, presumably Halfrunt. He said: \u2018Vell, Zaphod\u2019s just zis guy, you know?\u2019 but got no further because an electric pencil flew across the cabin and through the radio\u2019s on/off sensitive airspace. Zaphod turned and glared at Trillian \u2013 she had thrown the pencil. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, \u2018what you do that for?\u2019 Trillian was tapping her finger on a screenful of figures. \u2018I\u2019ve just thought of something,\u2019 she said. \u2018Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?\u2019 \u2018You hear enough about yourself as it is.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m very insecure. We know that.\u2019 \u2018Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important.\u2019 \u2018If there\u2019s anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\u2019 Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed. \u2018Listen,\u2019 she said, \u2018we picked up those couple of guys...\u2019 \u2018What couple of guys?\u2019 \u2018The couple of guys we picked up.\u2019 \u2018Oh yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018those couple of guys.\u2019 \u2018We picked them up in sector ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha.\u2019 \u2018Yeah?\u2019 said Zaphod, and blinked. Trillian said quietly, \u2018Does that mean anything to you?\u2019 \u2018Mmmm,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha?\u2019 \u2018Well?\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Er... what does the Z mean?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Which one?\u2019 \u2018Any one.\u2019 One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn\u2019t be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid. He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was so \u2013 but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the act. He preferred people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous. This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but she could no longer be bothered to argue about it. She sighed and punched up a star map on the visi screen so she could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it to be that way. \u2018There,\u2019 she pointed, \u2018right there.\u2019 \u2018Hey... yeah!\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Well?\u2019 she said. \u2018Well what?\u2019 Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the inside of her head. She said, very calmly, \u2018It\u2019s the same sector you originally picked me up in.\u2019 He looked at her and then looked back at the screen. \u2018Hey, yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018now that is wild. We should have zapped straight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come to be there? I mean that\u2019s nowhere.\u2019 She ignored this. \u2018Improbability Drive,\u2019 she said patiently. \u2018You explained it to me yourself. We pass through every point in the Universe, you know that.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, but that\u2019s one wild coincidence, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the Universe to choose from? That\u2019s just too... I want to work this out. Computer!\u2019 The Sirius Cybernetics Shipboard Computer which controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched into communication mode. \u2018Hi there!\u2019 it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said, Hi there! \u2018Oh God,\u2019 said Zaphod. He hadn\u2019t worked with this computer for long but had already learned to loathe it. The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling detergent. \u2018I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help you solve it.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Look, I think I\u2019ll just use a piece of paper.\u2019 \u2018Sure thing,\u2019 said the computer, spilling out its message into a waste bin at the same time, \u2018I understand. If you ever want\u2014\u2019 \u2018Shut up!\u2019 said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil he sat down next to Trillian at the console. \u2018OK, OK...\u2019 said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed down its speech channel again. Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them. \u2018Can we work out,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018from their point of view what the Improbability of their rescue was?\u2019 \u2018Yes, that\u2019s a constant,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018two to the power of two hundred and seventy six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s high. They\u2019re two lucky lucky guys.\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up...\u2019 Trillian punched up the figures. They showed two to the power of Infinity minus one to one against (an irrational number that only has a conventional meaning in Improbability physics). \u2018... it\u2019s pretty low,\u2019 continued Zaphod with a slight whistle. \u2018Yes,\u2019 agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically. \u2018That\u2019s one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for. Something pretty improbable has to show up on the balance sheet if it\u2019s all going to add up into a pretty sum.\u2019 Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the pencil away. \u2018Bat\u2019s dos, I can\u2019t work it out.\u2019 \u2018Well?\u2019 Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted his teeth. \u2018OK,\u2019 he said. \u2018Computer!\u2019 The voice circuits sprang to life again. \u2018Why hello there!\u2019 they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). \u2018All I want to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer...\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well shut up and work something out for me.\u2019 \u2018Sure thing,\u2019 chattered the computer, \u2018you want a probability forecast based on...\u2019 \u2018Improbability data, yeah.\u2019 \u2018OK,\u2019 the computer continued. \u2018Here\u2019s an interesting little notion. Did you realize that most people\u2019s lives are governed by telephone numbers?\u2019 A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod\u2019s faces and on to the other one. \u2018Have you flipped?\u2019 he said. \u2018No, but you will when I tell you that...\u2019 Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the Improbability flight path screen. \u2018Telephone number?\u2019 she said. \u2018Did that thing say telephone number?\u2019 Numbers flashed up on the screen. The computer had paused politely, but now it continued. \u2018What I was about to say was that...\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t bother, please,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Look, what is this?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018but those aliens \u2013 they\u2019re on the way up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them up on any monitor cameras?\u2019 13 Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning. \u2018... and then of course I\u2019ve got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side...\u2019 \u2018No?\u2019 said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. \u2018Really?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018I mean I\u2019ve asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens.\u2019 \u2018I can imagine.\u2019 Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. \u2018Well well well,\u2019 he kept saying to himself, \u2018Zaphod Beeblebrox...\u2019 Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand. \u2018You know what\u2019s happened now, of course?\u2019 \u2018No, what?\u2019 said Arthur, who didn\u2019t want to know. \u2018We\u2019ve arrived at another of those doors.\u2019 There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor. Marvin eyed it suspiciously. \u2018Well?\u2019 said Ford impatiently. \u2018Do we go through?\u2019 \u2018Do we go through?\u2019 mimicked Marvin. \u2018Yes. This is the entrance to the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities today I shouldn\u2019t wonder.\u2019 Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open. \u2018Thank you,\u2019 it said, \u2018for making a simple door very happy.\u2019 Deep in Marvin\u2019s thorax gears ground. \u2018Funny,\u2019 he intoned funereally, \u2018how just when you think life can\u2019t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.\u2019 He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside they heard Marvin\u2019s voice again. \u2018I suppose you\u2019ll want to see the aliens now,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I\u2019m standing?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, just show them in would you, Marvin?\u2019 came another voice. Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing. \u2018What\u2019s...?\u2019 \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018come on in.\u2019 He stepped through into the bridge. Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console picking the teeth in his right hand head with his left hand. The right hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this task, but the left hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed, nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn\u2019t believe he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw flopped about at a loose end for a while. The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling affectation of nonchalance said, \u2018Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in.\u2019 Ford was not going to be outcooled. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 he drawled, \u2018great to see you, you\u2019re looking well, the extra arm suits you. Nice ship you\u2019ve stolen.\u2019 Arthur goggled at him. \u2018You mean you know this guy?\u2019 he said, waving a wild finger at Zaphod. \u2018Know him!\u2019 exclaimed Ford. \u2018He\u2019s...\u2019 He paused, and decided to do the introductions the other way round. \u2018Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent,\u2019 he said. \u2018I saved him when his planet blew up.\u2019 \u2018Oh sure,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018hi, Arthur, glad you could make it.\u2019 His right hand head looked round casually, said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 and went back to having its teeth picked. Ford carried on. \u2018And Arthur,\u2019 he said, \u2018this is my semi cousin Zaphod Beeb\u2014\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ve met,\u2019 said Arthur sharply. When you\u2019re cruising down the road in the fast lane and you lazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from fourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford Prefect off his. \u2018Er... what?\u2019 he said. \u2018I said we\u2019ve met.\u2019 Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum sharply. \u2018Hey... er, have we? Hey... er...\u2019 Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he felt he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as much about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford based gnat knew about life in Peking. \u2018What do you mean you\u2019ve met?\u2019 he demanded. \u2018This is Zaphod Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith from Croydon.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 said Arthur coldly. \u2018We\u2019ve met, haven\u2019t we Zaphod Beeblebrox \u2013 or should I say... Phil?\u2019 \u2018What!\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018You\u2019ll have to remind me,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I\u2019ve a terrible memory for species.\u2019 \u2018It was at a party,\u2019 pursued Arthur. \u2018Yeah, well I doubt that,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Cool it, will you, Arthur!\u2019 demanded Ford. Arthur would not be deterred. \u2018A party six months ago. On Earth... England...\u2019 Zaphod shook his head with a tight lipped smile. \u2018London,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018Islington.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Zaphod with a guilty start, \u2018that party.\u2019 This wasn\u2019t fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards between Arthur and Zaphod. \u2018What?\u2019 he said to Zaphod. \u2018You don\u2019t mean to say you\u2019ve been on that miserable little planet as well, do you?\u2019 \u2018No, of course not,\u2019 said Zaphod breezily. \u2018Well, I may have just dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere...\u2019 \u2018But I was stuck there for fifteen years!\u2019 \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t know that, did I?\u2019 \u2018But what were you doing there?\u2019 \u2018Looking about, you know.\u2019 \u2018He gatecrashed a party,\u2019 said Arthur, trembling with anger, \u2018a fancy dress party...\u2019 \u2018It would have to be, wouldn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018At this party,\u2019 persisted Arthur, \u2018was a girl... Oh well, look it doesn\u2019t matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke anyway...\u2019 \u2018I wish you\u2019d stop sulking about that bloody planet,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Who was the lady?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just somebody. Well all right, I wasn\u2019t doing very well with her. I\u2019d been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though. Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I\u2019d got her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk when this friend of yours barges up and says, \u201cHey doll, is this guy boring you? Why don\u2019t you talk to me instead? I\u2019m from a different planet.\u201d I never saw her again.\u2019 \u2018Zaphod?\u2019 exclaimed Ford. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel foolish. \u2018He only had the two arms and the one head and he called himself Phil, but...\u2019 \u2018But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet,\u2019 said Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the bridge. She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him like a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the ship\u2019s controls again. There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the scrambled mess of Arthur\u2019s brain crawled some words. \u2018Tricia McMillan?\u2019 he said. \u2018What are you doing here?\u2019 \u2018Same as you,\u2019 she said, \u2018I hitched a lift. After all with a degree in maths and another in astrophysics what else was there to do? It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday.\u2019 \u2018Infinity minus one,\u2019 chattered the computer. \u2018Improbability sum now complete.\u2019 Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at Trillian. \u2018Trillian,\u2019 he said, \u2018is this sort of thing going to happen every time we use the Improbability Drive?\u2019 \u2018Very probably, I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 she said. 14 The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space, now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious perversion of physics \u2013 as if relationships between people were susceptible to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms and molecules. As the ship\u2019s artificial night closed in they were each grateful to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their thoughts. Trillian couldn\u2019t sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small cage which contained her last and only links with Earth \u2013 two white mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had expected never to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by her negative reaction to the news of the planet\u2019s destruction. It seemed remote and unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about it. She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied her whole attention. Suddenly she shook herself and went back on to the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures that charted the ship\u2019s progress through the void. She wished she knew what it was she was trying not to think about. Zaphod couldn\u2019t sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he wouldn\u2019t let himself think about. For as long as he could remember he\u2019d suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not all there. Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside and not worry about it, but it had been re awakened by the sudden inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn\u2019t see. Ford couldn\u2019t sleep. He was too excited about being back on the road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just as he was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed to be something faintly odd about his semi cousin that he couldn\u2019t put his finger on. The fact that he had become President of the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his leaving the post. Was there a reason behind it? There would be no point in asking Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for anything he did at all: he had turned unfathomability into an art form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture of extraordinary genius and na\u00efve incompetence and it was often difficult to tell which was which. Arthur slept: he was terribly tired. There was a tap at Zaphod\u2019s door. It slid open. \u2018Zaphod...?\u2019 \u2018Yeah?\u2019 Trillian stood outlined in the oval of light. \u2018I think we just found what you came to look for.\u2019 \u2018Hey, yeah?\u2019 Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was a small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while and tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of Vogons but couldn\u2019t think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to the bridge. As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched excitedly over the instruments. \u2018See? The ship\u2019s about to move into orbit,\u2019 Trillian was saying. \u2018There\u2019s a planet out there. It\u2019s at the exact coordinates you predicted.\u2019 Zaphod heard a noise and looked up. \u2018Ford!\u2019 he hissed. \u2018Hey, come and take a look at this.\u2019 Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures flickering over a screen. \u2018You recognize those Galactic coordinates?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll give you a clue. Computer!\u2019 \u2018Hi, gang!\u2019 enthused the computer. \u2018This is getting real sociable, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Shut up,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018and show up the screens.\u2019 Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at the external monitor screens. There was absolutely nothing on them. \u2018Recognize that?\u2019 whispered Zaphod. Ford frowned. \u2018Er, no,\u2019 he said. \u2018What do you see?\u2019 \u2018Nothing.\u2019 \u2018Recognize it?\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud.\u2019 \u2018And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?\u2019 \u2018Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you\u2019d see a dark screen.\u2019 \u2018Very good.\u2019 Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something, almost childishly so. \u2018Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What would you reckon to find here?\u2019 urged Zaphod. \u2018Nothing.\u2019 \u2018No stars? No planets?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Computer!\u2019 shouted Zaphod. \u2018Rotate angle of vision through one eighty degrees and don\u2019t talk about it!\u2019 For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the size of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another one \u2013 a binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the corner of the picture \u2013 a red glare shading away into deep black, the night side of the planet. \u2018I\u2019ve found it!\u2019 cried Zaphod, thumping the console. \u2018I\u2019ve found it!\u2019 Ford stared at it in astonishment. \u2018What is it?\u2019 he said. \u2018That...\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018is the most improbable planet that ever existed.\u2019 15 (Excerpt from The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784, Section 5a. Entry: Magrathea) Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and largely tax free. Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic space. In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before \u2013 and thus was the Empire forged. Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor \u2013 at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they\u2019d settled on \u2013 none of them was entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn\u2019t quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink. And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom made luxury planet building. The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets \u2013 gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes \u2013 all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy\u2019s richest men naturally came to expect. But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion hungry worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treatises on the value of a planned political economy. Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the obscurity of legend. In these enlightened days, of course, no one believes a word of it. 16 Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. Ford was waving his arms about. \u2018You\u2019re crazy, Zaphod,\u2019 he was saying, \u2018Magrathea is a myth, a fairy story, it\u2019s what parents tell their kids about at night if they want them to grow up to become economists, it\u2019s...\u2019 \u2018And that\u2019s what we are currently in orbit about,\u2019 insisted Zaphod. \u2018Look, I can\u2019t help what you may personally be in orbit around,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018but this ship...\u2019 \u2018Computer!\u2019 shouted Zaphod. \u2018Oh no...\u2019 \u2018Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I\u2019m feeling just great, guys, and I know I\u2019m just going to get a bundle of kicks out of any program you care to run through me.\u2019 Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come on in but keep quiet. \u2018Computer,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018tell us again what our present trajectory is.\u2019 \u2018A real pleasure, feller,\u2019 it burbled, \u2018we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea.\u2019 \u2018Proving nothing,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t trust that computer to speak my weight.\u2019 \u2018I can do that for you, sure,\u2019 enthused the computer, punching out more tickertape. \u2018I can even work out your personality problems to ten decimal places if it will help.\u2019 Trillian interrupted. \u2018Zaphod,\u2019 she said, \u2018any minute now we will be swinging round to the daylight side of this planet,\u2019 adding, \u2018whatever it turns out to be.\u2019 \u2018Hey, what do you mean by that? The planet\u2019s where I predicted it would be, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Yes, I know there\u2019s a planet there. I\u2019m not arguing with anyone, it\u2019s just that I wouldn\u2019t know Magrathea from any other lump of cold rock. Dawn\u2019s coming up if you want it.\u2019 \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 muttered Zaphod. \u2018Let\u2019s at least give our eyes a good time. Computer!\u2019 \u2018Hi there! What can I\u2014\u2019 \u2018Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again.\u2019 A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens \u2013 the planet rolling away beneath them. They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with excitement. \u2018We are now traversing the night side...\u2019 he said in a hushed voice. The planet rolled on. \u2018The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us...\u2019 he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion to what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He was piqued by Ford\u2019s sceptical reaction. Magrathea! \u2018In a few seconds,\u2019 he continued, \u2018we should see... there!\u2019 The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp can\u2019t help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen from space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the Galaxy. Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding light. It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible, furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with white fire. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin atmosphere beneath them. \u2018The fires of dawn!\u2019 breathed Zaphod. \u2018The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...!\u2019 \u2018Or whatever,\u2019 said Ford quietly. \u2018Soulianis and Rahm!\u2019 insisted Zaphod. The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because he hated humans so much. As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense seemed juvenile. Isn\u2019t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too? All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on. \u2018I only know what Zaphod\u2019s told me,\u2019 she whispered. \u2018Apparently Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one seriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that the legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets.\u2019 Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. \u2018Is there any tea on this spaceship?\u2019 he asked. More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in the black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common light of day \u2013 grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features would appear on the distant horizon \u2013 ravines, maybe mountains, maybe even cities \u2013 but as they approached the lines would soften and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire. The planet\u2019s surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century. Clearly, it was very very old. A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, he could feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat. \u2018Well, even supposing it is...\u2019 \u2018It is,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Which it isn\u2019t,\u2019 continued Ford. \u2018What do you want with it anyway? There\u2019s nothing there.\u2019 \u2018Not on the surface,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018All right, just supposing there\u2019s something, I take it you\u2019re not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you after?\u2019 One of Zaphod\u2019s heads looked away. The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn\u2019t looking at anything very much. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Zaphod airily, \u2018it\u2019s partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it\u2019s the fame and the money...\u2019 Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that Zaphod hadn\u2019t the faintest idea why he was there at all. \u2018You know, I don\u2019t like the look of that planet at all,\u2019 said Trillian, shivering. \u2018Ah, take no notice,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018with half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look frumpy.\u2019 Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now. He shrugged. \u2018I think it\u2019s just a dead planet,\u2019 he said. \u2018The suspense is killing me,\u2019 said Arthur testily. Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not be in any way exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance. The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea. The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a mousecage, the bruising of somebody\u2019s upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale. In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustains the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever. 17 After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur\u2019s mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with. He had found a Nutri Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The way it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject\u2019s taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject\u2019s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject\u2019s brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The Nutri Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau star system. Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him. \u2018Is it safe?\u2019 he said. \u2018Magrathea\u2019s been dead for five million years,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018of course it\u2019s safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now.\u2019 At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge \u2013 a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial. The voice said \u2018Greetings to you...\u2019 Someone from the dead planet was talking to them. \u2018Computer!\u2019 shouted Zaphod. \u2018Hi there!\u2019 \u2018What the photon is it?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just some five million year old tape that\u2019s being broadcast at us.\u2019 \u2018A what? A recording?\u2019 \u2018Shush!\u2019 said Ford. \u2018It\u2019s carrying on.\u2019 The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace. \u2018This is a recorded announcement,\u2019 it said, \u2018as I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re all out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit...\u2019 (\u2018A voice from ancient Magrathea!\u2019 shouted Zaphod. \u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Ford.) \u2018... but regrets,\u2019 continued the voice, \u2018that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone.\u2019 A short buzz followed, then silence. \u2018They want to get rid of us,\u2019 said Trillian nervously. \u2018What do we do?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just a recording,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018We keep going. Got that, computer?\u2019 \u2018I got it,\u2019 said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed. They waited. After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice. \u2018We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from all that\u2019s best in contemporary geography.\u2019 The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. \u2018Meanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave. Now.\u2019 Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions. \u2018Well, I suppose we\u2019d better be going, then, hadn\u2019t we?\u2019 he suggested. \u2018Shhh!\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018There\u2019s absolutely nothing to be worried about.\u2019 \u2018Then why\u2019s everyone so tense?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re just interested!\u2019 shouted Zaphod. \u2018Computer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing.\u2019 This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice now distinctly cold. \u2018It is most gratifying,\u2019 it said, \u2018that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom in future lives... Thank you.\u2019 The voice snapped off. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Er...\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Well?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Look,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018will you get it into your heads? That\u2019s just a recorded message. It\u2019s millions of years old. It doesn\u2019t apply to us, get it?\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Trillian quietly, \u2018about the missiles?\u2019 \u2018Missiles? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u2019 Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen. Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus \u2013 two massively real rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was shocking. \u2018I think they\u2019re going to have a very good try at applying to us,\u2019 said Ford. Zaphod stared at them in astonishment. \u2018Hey, this is terrific!\u2019 he said. \u2018Someone down there is trying to kill us!\u2019 \u2018Terrific,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018But don\u2019t you see what this means?\u2019 \u2018Yes. We\u2019re going to die.\u2019 \u2018Yes, but apart from that.\u2019 \u2018Apart from that?\u2019 \u2018It means we must be on to something!\u2019 \u2018How soon can we get off it?\u2019 Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen grew larger. They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on. \u2018As a matter of interest,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018what are we going to do?\u2019 \u2018Just keep cool,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Is that all?\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018No, we\u2019re also going to... er... take evasive action!\u2019 said Zaphod with a sudden access of panic. \u2018Computer, what evasive action can we take?\u2019 \u2018Er, none I\u2019m afraid, guys,\u2019 said the computer. \u2018... or something,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018... er...\u2019 he said. \u2018There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems,\u2019 explained the computer brightly. \u2018Impact minus forty five seconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax.\u2019 Zaphod tried to run several equally decisive directions simultaneously. \u2018Right!\u2019 he said. \u2018Er... we\u2019ve got to get manual control of this ship.\u2019 \u2018Can you fly her?\u2019 asked Ford pleasantly. \u2018No, can you?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Trillian, can you?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Zaphod, relaxing. \u2018We\u2019ll do it together.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t either,\u2019 said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself. \u2018I\u2019d guessed that,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018OK, computer, I want full manual control now.\u2019 \u2018You got it,\u2019 said the computer. Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled up cellophane: these controls had never been used before. Zaphod stared at them wildly. \u2018OK, Ford,\u2019 he said, \u2018full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard. Or something...\u2019 \u2018Good luck, guys,\u2019 chirped the computer, \u2018impact minus thirty seconds...\u2019 Ford leapt to the controls \u2013 only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocket jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously. He released half of them and the ship spun round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles. Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move. Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system. The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin. Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone. It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be emphasized because, as has already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely assured. \u2018Impact minus twenty seconds, guys...\u2019 said the computer. \u2018Then turn the bloody engines back on!\u2019 bawled Zaphod. \u2018Oh, sure thing, guys,\u2019 said the computer. With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again. The computer started to sing. \u2018When you walk through the storm...\u2019 it whined nasally, \u2018hold your head up high...\u2019 Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction. \u2018And don\u2019t... be afraid... of the dark!\u2019 Eddie wailed. The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems. \u2018At the end of the storm...\u2019 crooned Eddie. The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship. \u2018... is a golden sky...\u2019 But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it. \u2018and the sweet silver song of the lark... Revised impact time fifteen seconds, fellas... Walk on through the wind...\u2019 The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit. \u2018This is it,\u2019 said Arthur watching them. \u2018We are now quite definitely going to die, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 \u2018I wish you\u2019d stop saying that,\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018Well, we are, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Walk on through the rain...\u2019 sang Eddie. A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet. \u2018Why doesn\u2019t anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?\u2019 he said. \u2018We could probably reach that.\u2019 \u2018What are you, crazy?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Without proper programming anything could happen.\u2019 \u2018Does that matter at this stage?\u2019 shouted Arthur. \u2018Though your dreams be tossed and blown...\u2019 sang Eddie. Arthur scrambled up on to one of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling. \u2018Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart...\u2019 \u2018Does anyone know why Arthur can\u2019t turn on the Improbability Drive?\u2019 shouted Trillian. \u2018And you\u2019ll never walk alone... Impact minus five seconds, it\u2019s been great knowing you, guys, God bless... You\u2019ll ne... ver... walk... alone!\u2019 \u2018I said,\u2019 yelled Trillian, \u2018does anyone know\u2014\u2019 The next thing that happened was a mind mangling explosion of noise and light. 18 And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought iron legs. As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands. Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful. Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019 \u2018Well, I was just saying,\u2019 said Arthur, lounging by a small fish pool, \u2018there\u2019s this Improbability Drive switch over here...\u2019 He waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now. \u2018But where are we?\u2019 said Ford, who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand. \u2018Exactly where we were, I think...\u2019 said Trillian, as all about them the mirrors suddenly showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them. Zaphod leapt out of his seat. \u2018Then what\u2019s happened to the missiles?\u2019 he said. A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors. \u2018They would appear,\u2019 said Ford doubtfully, \u2018to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale...\u2019 \u2018At an improbability factor,\u2019 cut in Eddie, who hadn\u2019t changed a bit, \u2018of eight million seven hundred and sixty seven thousand one hundred and twenty eight to one against.\u2019 Zaphod stared at Arthur. \u2018Did you think of that, Earthman?\u2019 he demanded. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018all I did was...\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s very good thinking, you know. Turn on the Improbability Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens. Hey, kid, you just saved our lives, you know that?\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018well, it was nothing really...\u2019 \u2018Was it?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Oh well, forget it, then. OK, computer, take us in to land.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018I said forget it.\u2019 Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more. This is a complete record of its thought from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it. Ah...! What\u2019s happening? it thought. Er, excuse me, who am I? Hello? Why am I here? What\u2019s my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? Calm down, get a grip now... Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is it? It\u2019s a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in my... my... well I suppose I\u2019d better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let\u2019s call it my stomach. Good. Ooooh, it\u2019s getting quite strong. And hey, what about this whistling roaring sound going past what I\u2019m suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that... wind! Is that a good name? It\u2019ll do... perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I\u2019ve found out what it\u2019s for. It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it. Hey! What\u2019s this thing? This... let\u2019s call it a tail \u2013 yeah, tail. Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good, can\u2019t I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn\u2019t seem to achieve very much but I\u2019ll probably find out what it\u2019s for later on. Now \u2013 have I built up any coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I\u2019m quite dizzy with anticipation... Or is it the wind? There really is a lot of that now, isn\u2019t there? And wow! Hey! What\u2019s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like... ow... ound... round... ground! That\u2019s it! That\u2019s a good name \u2013 ground! I wonder if it will be friends with me? And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence. Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was, Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now. 19 \u2018Are we taking this robot with us?\u2019 said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin, who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree. Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed. \u2018Oh, the Paranoid Android,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll take him.\u2019 \u2018But what are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?\u2019 \u2018You think you\u2019ve got problems,\u2019 said Marvin as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, \u2018what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don\u2019t bother to answer that, I\u2019m fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don\u2019t know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.\u2019 Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin. \u2018My white mice have escaped!\u2019 she said. An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod\u2019s faces. \u2018Nuts to your white mice,\u2019 he said. Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again. It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second. \u2018Good afternoon, boys.\u2019 The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different. It had a matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface. They looked at each other in puzzlement. \u2018It\u2019s the computer,\u2019 explained Zaphod. \u2018I discovered it had an emergency back up personality that I thought might work out better.\u2019 \u2018Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet,\u2019 continued Eddie\u2019s new voice, \u2018so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug eyed monsters.\u2019 Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch. \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think we might be better off with a slide rule.\u2019 \u2018Right!\u2019 snapped the computer. \u2018Who said that?\u2019 \u2018Will you open up the exit hatch, please, computer?\u2019 said Zaphod, trying not to get angry. \u2018Not until whoever said that owns up,\u2019 urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed. \u2018Oh God,\u2019 muttered Ford. He slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten. He was desperately worried that one day sentient life forms would forget how to do this. Only by counting could humans demonstrate their independence of computers. \u2018Come on,\u2019 said Eddie sternly. \u2018Computer\u2014\u2019 began Zaphod. \u2018I\u2019m waiting,\u2019 interrupted Eddie. \u2018I can wait all day if necessary...\u2019 \u2018Computer...\u2019 said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, \u2018if you don\u2019t open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got that?\u2019 Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this. Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying, \u2018Blood... blood... blood... blood...\u2019 Finally Eddie said quietly, \u2018I can see this relationship is something we\u2019re all going to have to work at,\u2019 and the hatchway opened. An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea. \u2018It\u2019ll all end in tears, I know it,\u2019 shouted Eddie after them and closed the hatchway again. A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatch way again in response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise. 20 Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at. It was like a dried out marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick. It was very cold. Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground. The wind stung Arthur\u2019s eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat. However, the thing that was stung most was his mind. \u2018It\u2019s fantastic...\u2019 he said, and his own voice rattled his ears. Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere. \u2018Desolate hole, if you ask me,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018I could have more fun in a cat litter.\u2019 He felt a mounting irritation. Of all the planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy \u2013 many wild and exotic, seething with life \u2013 didn\u2019t he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hotdog stand in evidence. He stooped down and picked up a cold clod of earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years to look at. \u2018No,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018don\u2019t you understand, this is the first time I\u2019ve actually stood on the surface of another planet... a whole alien world...! Pity it\u2019s such a dump, though.\u2019 Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them. She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him. He seemed to be excited, but they couldn\u2019t clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind. As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular \u2013 a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was splattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and looked at a piece. It was wet. It was rubbery. With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat. At the top of the crater\u2019s lip they met Zaphod. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said, pointing into the crater. In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn\u2019t lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot. The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian\u2019s throat. \u2018I suppose there\u2019s no point in trying to bury it?\u2019 murmured Arthur, and then wished he hadn\u2019t. \u2018Come,\u2019 said Zaphod and started back down into the crater. \u2018What, down there?\u2019 said Trillian with severe distaste. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018come on, I\u2019ve got something to show you.\u2019 \u2018We can see it,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Not that,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018something else. Come on.\u2019 They all hesitated. \u2018Come on,\u2019 insisted Zaphod. \u2018I\u2019ve found a way in.\u2019 \u2018In?\u2019 said Arthur in horror. \u2018Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The force of the whale\u2019s impact cracked it open, and that\u2019s where we have to go. Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths of time itself...\u2019 Marvin started his ironical humming again. Zaphod hit him and he shut up. With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard to avoid looking at its unfortunate creator. \u2018Life,\u2019 said Marvin dolefully, \u2018loathe it or ignore it, you can\u2019t like it.\u2019 The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails. Zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster. Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom. \u2018According to the legends,\u2019 he said, \u2018the Magratheans lived most of their lives underground.\u2019 \u2018Why\u2019s that?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated?\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I think they just didn\u2019t like it very much.\u2019 \u2018Are you sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u2019 said Trillian, peering nervously into the darkness. \u2018We\u2019ve been attacked once already, you know.\u2019 \u2018Look, kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the four of us, so come on, let\u2019s get on in there. Er, hey, Earthman...\u2019 \u2018Arthur,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Yeah, could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway. OK?\u2019 \u2018Guard?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018What from? You just said there\u2019s no one here.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Whose? Yours or mine?\u2019 \u2018Good lad. OK, here we go.\u2019 Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford. \u2018Well, I hope you all have a really miserable time,\u2019 complained Arthur. \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Marvin assured him, \u2018they will.\u2019 In a few seconds they had disappeared from view. Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale\u2019s graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in. Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off. Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding purposefully. He flung the torch beam around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, the air thick with decay. \u2018There, what did I tell you?\u2019 he said. \u2018An inhabited planet. Magrathea.\u2019 And he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile floors. Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid. At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics \u2013 simple angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them. She called to Zaphod. \u2018Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?\u2019 \u2018I think they\u2019re just strange symbols of some kind,\u2019 said Zaphod, hardly glancing back. Trillian shrugged and hurried after him. From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment. He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look. Trillian followed. \u2018Look,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018you reckon this is Magrathea...\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018and we heard the voice, right?\u2019 \u2018OK, so I\u2019ve bought the fact that it\u2019s Magrathea \u2013 for the moment. What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it. You didn\u2019t just look it up in a star atlas, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019 \u2018Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky guesses. Easy.\u2019 \u2018And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?\u2019 \u2018I stole it to look for a lot of things.\u2019 \u2018A lot of things?\u2019 said Ford in surprise. \u2018Like what?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018Because... because... I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to look for them.\u2019 \u2018What, are you, crazy?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a possibility I haven\u2019t ruled out yet,\u2019 said Zaphod quietly. \u2018I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions. And its current conditions are not good.\u2019 For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind suddenly full of worry. \u2018Listen, old friend, if you want to...\u2019 started Ford eventually. \u2018No, wait... I\u2019ll tell you something,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I freewheel a lot. I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it. I reckon I\u2019ll become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it\u2019s easy. I decide to steal this ship. I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out. It\u2019s like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques. And then whenever I stop and think \u2013 why did I want to do something? \u2013 how did I work out how to do it? \u2013 I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it. Like I have now. It\u2019s a big effort to talk about it.\u2019 Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he frowned and said, \u2018Last night I was worrying about this again. About the fact that part of my mind just didn\u2019t seem to work properly. Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it. I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn\u2019t use it. I wondered if there was a way I could check. \u2018I went to the ship\u2019s medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelographic screen. I went through every major screening test on both my heads \u2013 all the tests I had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for the Presidency could be properly ratified. They showed up nothing. Nothing unexpected, at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn\u2019t have guessed. And no other anomalies. So I started inventing further tests, completely at random. Nothing. Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head. Still nothing. Finally I got silly, because I\u2019d given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia. Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter. You remember I was always superstitious about the colour green when I was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?\u2019 Ford nodded. \u2018And there it was,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018clear as day. A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatized those two lumps of cerebellum.\u2019 Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white. \u2018Somebody did that to you?\u2019 whispered Ford. \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018But have you any idea who? Or why?\u2019 \u2018Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was.\u2019 \u2018You know? How do you know?\u2019 \u2018Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses. They left them there for me to see.\u2019 Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl. \u2018Initials? Burnt into your brain?\u2019 \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Well, what were they, for God\u2019s sake?\u2019 Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he looked away. \u2018Z. B.,\u2019 he said quietly. At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you about it later,\u2019 choked Zaphod as all three passed out. 21 On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily. Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few buttons at random. The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time. One of them (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he\u2019d bought over the past few years. There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and super intelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biroorientated stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life. And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public. When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying. There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairian dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s highly profitable second hand biro business. Arthur read this, and put the book down. The robot still sat there, completely inert. Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked around the crater. He watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathea. He went back into the crater. He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody. \u2018Night\u2019s falling,\u2019 he said. \u2018Look, robot, the stars are coming out.\u2019 From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen. The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back. \u2018I know,\u2019 he said. \u2018Wretched, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018But that sunset! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams... the two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling into space.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve seen it,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018It\u2019s rubbish.\u2019 \u2018We only ever had the one sun at home,\u2019 persevered Arthur, \u2018I came from a planet called Earth, you know.\u2019 \u2018I know,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018you keep going on about it. It sounds awful.\u2019 \u2018Ah no, it was a beautiful place.\u2019 \u2018Did it have oceans?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur with a sigh, \u2018great wide rolling blue oceans...\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t bear oceans,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Tell me,\u2019 enquired Arthur, \u2018do you get on well with other robots?\u2019 \u2018Hate them,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 Arthur couldn\u2019t bear any more. He had got up again. \u2018I think I\u2019ll just take another walk,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t blame you,\u2019 said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later. Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged back up the wall of the crater. Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him. 22 He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he didn\u2019t turn yet, not even to react to Arthur\u2019s yelp of surprise. Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind \u2013 a small hover craft, Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it. The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed. \u2018You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet,\u2019 he said. \u2018Who... who are you?\u2019 stammered Arthur. The man looked away. Again a look of sadness seemed to cross his face. \u2018My name is not important,\u2019 he said. He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn\u2019t have to rush at. Arthur felt awkward. \u2018I... er... you startled me...\u2019 he said, lamely. The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows. \u2018Hmmm?\u2019 he said. \u2018I said you startled me.\u2019 \u2018Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you.\u2019 Arthur frowned at him. \u2018But you shot at us! There were missiles...\u2019 he said. The man gazed into the pit of the crater. The slight glow from Marvin\u2019s eyes cast very faint red shadows on the huge carcass of the whale. The man chuckled slightly. \u2018An automatic system,\u2019 he said and gave a small sigh. \u2018Ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony.\u2019 He looked gravely at Arthur and said, \u2018I\u2019m a great fan of science, you know.\u2019 \u2018Oh... er, really?\u2019 said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man\u2019s curious, kindly manner disconcerting. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the old man, and simply stopped talking again. \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018er...\u2019 He had an odd feeling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman\u2019s husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again. \u2018You seem ill at ease,\u2019 said the old man with polite concern. \u2018Er, no... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren\u2019t really expecting to find anybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something...\u2019 \u2018Dead?\u2019 said the old man. \u2018Good gracious me no, we have but slept.\u2019 \u2018Slept?\u2019 said Arthur incredulously. \u2018Yes, through the economic recession, you see,\u2019 said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not. Arthur had to prompt him again. \u2018Er, economic recession?\u2019 \u2018Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom built planets are something of a luxury commodity, you see...\u2019 He paused and looked at Arthur. \u2018You know we built planets, do you?\u2019 he asked solemnly. \u2018Well yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019d sort of gathered...\u2019 \u2018Fascinating trade,\u2019 said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, \u2018doing the coastlines was always my favourite. Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords... so anyway,\u2019 he said, trying to find his thread again, \u2018the recession came and we decided it would save a lot of bother if we just slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over.\u2019 The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued. \u2018The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices, you see, so that we\u2019d all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services.\u2019 Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this. \u2018That\u2019s a pretty unpleasant way to behave, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Is it?\u2019 asked the old man mildly. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a bit out of touch.\u2019 He pointed down into the crater. \u2018Is that robot yours?\u2019 he said. \u2018No,\u2019 came a thin metallic voice from the crater, \u2018I\u2019m mine.\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019d call it a robot,\u2019 muttered Arthur. \u2018It\u2019s more a sort of electronic sulking machine.\u2019 \u2018Bring it,\u2019 said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man\u2019s voice. He called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn\u2019t. \u2018On second thoughts,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018leave it here. You must come with me. Great things are afoot.\u2019 He turned towards his craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark. Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself. \u2018Come,\u2019 called the old man, \u2018come now or you will be late.\u2019 \u2018Late?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018What for?\u2019 \u2018What is your name, human?\u2019 \u2018Dent. Arthur Dent,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent,\u2019 said the old man, sternly. \u2018It\u2019s a sort of threat you see.\u2019 Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes. \u2018I\u2019ve never been very good at them myself, but I\u2019m told they can be very effective.\u2019 Arthur blinked at him. \u2018What an extraordinary person,\u2019 he muttered to himself. \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 said the old man. \u2018Oh nothing, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Arthur in embarrassment. \u2018All right, where do we go?\u2019 \u2018In my aircar,\u2019 said the man, motioning Arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to them. \u2018We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five million year slumber. Magrathea awakes.\u2019 Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky, quite unsettled him. He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel. \u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said to him, \u2018what is your name by the way?\u2019 \u2018My name?\u2019 said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again. He paused. \u2018My name,\u2019 he said, \u2018... is Slartibartfast.\u2019 Arthur practically choked. \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 he spluttered. \u2018Slartibartfast,\u2019 repeated the old man quietly. \u2018Slartibartfast?\u2019 The old man looked at him gravely. \u2018I said it wasn\u2019t important,\u2019 he said. The aircar sailed through the night. 23 It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much \u2013 the wheel, New York, wars and so on \u2013 whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man \u2013 for precisely the same reasons. Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for titbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived. The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the \u2018Star Spangled Banner\u2019, but in fact the message was this: So long, and thanks for all the fish. In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures\u2019 plans. 24 Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night. It sped swiftly. Arthur\u2019s companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that. Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all. Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircar dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over. The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened. They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour. He closed his eyes in terror. After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt. He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light. It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultraviolet. Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes. \u2018Earthman,\u2019 he said, \u2018we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea.\u2019 \u2018How did you know I was an Earthman?\u2019 demanded Arthur. \u2018These things will become clear to you,\u2019 said the old man gently, \u2018at least,\u2019 he added with slight doubt in his voice, \u2018clearer than they are at the moment.\u2019 He continued: \u2018I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a little too... large. We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you.\u2019 Arthur made nervous noises. Slartibartfast, touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly, \u2018It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight.\u2019 The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like. It wasn\u2019t infinity, in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity \u2013 distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very very big, so big that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself. Arthur\u2019s senses bobbed and span as, travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them. The wall. The wall defied the imagination \u2013 seduced it and defeated it. The wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man. The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved. It met itself again thirteen light seconds away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light. \u2018Welcome,\u2019 said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mind boggling space, \u2018welcome,\u2019 he said, \u2018to our factory floor.\u2019 Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space. \u2018This,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018is where we make most of our planets, you see.\u2019 \u2018You mean,\u2019 said Arthur, trying to form the words, \u2018you mean you\u2019re starting it all up again now?\u2019 \u2018No no, good heavens no,\u2019 exclaimed the old man, \u2018no, the Galaxy isn\u2019t nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we\u2019ve been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very... special clients from another dimension. It may interest you... there in the distance in front of us.\u2019 Arthur followed the old man\u2019s finger, till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a subliminal impression than anything one could put one\u2019s finger on. At that moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within. Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense. Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction. The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt. \u2018The Earth...\u2019 whispered Arthur. \u2018Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact,\u2019 said Slartibartfast cheerfully. \u2018We\u2019re making a copy from our original blueprints.\u2019 There was a pause. \u2018Are you trying to tell me,\u2019 said Arthur, slowly and with control, \u2018that you originally... made the Earth?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Slartibartfast. \u2018Did you ever go to a place... I think it was called Norway?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018no, I didn\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Pity,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018that was one of mine. Won an award, you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear of its destruction.\u2019 \u2018You were upset!\u2019 \u2018Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered so much. It was a quite shocking cock up.\u2019 \u2018Huh?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018The mice were furious.\u2019 \u2018The mice were furious?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the old man mildly. \u2018Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses, but...\u2019 \u2018Ah, but they hadn\u2019t paid for it, you see, had they?\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?\u2019 For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old man tried patiently to explain. \u2018Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we\u2019ve got to build another one.\u2019 Only one word was registering with Arthur. \u2018Mice?\u2019 he said. \u2018Indeed, Earthman.\u2019 \u2018Look, sorry \u2013 are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms?\u2019 Slartibartfast coughed politely. \u2018Earthman,\u2019 he said, \u2018it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech. Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak. These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front.\u2019 The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued. \u2018They\u2019ve been experimenting on you, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 Arthur thought about this for a moment, and then his face cleared. \u2018Ah no,\u2019 he said, \u2018I see the source of the misunderstanding now. No, look, you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was that the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run round mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined. From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own...\u2019 Arthur\u2019s voice tailed off. \u2018Such subtlety...\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018one has to admire it.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide your thinking? Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis \u2013 if it\u2019s finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous.\u2019 He paused for effect. \u2018You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings. Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten million year research program... \u2018Let me tell you the whole story. It\u2019ll take a little time.\u2019 \u2018Time,\u2019 said Arthur weakly, \u2018is not currently one of my problems.\u2019 25 There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are: Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches? Many many millions of years ago a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all. And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off. It was the size of a small city. Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahogany topped with rich ultrared leather. The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree lined public square. On the day of the Great On Turning two soberly dressed programmers with briefcases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office. They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their briefcases and took out their leather bound notebooks. Their names were Lunkwill and Fook. For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunk will leaned forward and touched a small black panel. The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich, resonant and deep. It said: \u2018What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space, have been called into existence?\u2019 Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise. \u2018Your task, O Computer...\u2019 began Fook. \u2018No, wait a minute, this isn\u2019t right,\u2019 said Lunkwill, worried. \u2018We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and we\u2019re not making do with second best. Deep Thought,\u2019 he addressed the computer, \u2018are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest, most powerful computer in all time?\u2019 \u2018I described myself as the second greatest,\u2019 intoned Deep Thought, \u2018and such I am.\u2019 Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill cleared his throat. \u2018There must be some mistake,\u2019 he said, \u2018are you not a greater computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain at Maximegalon which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?\u2019 \u2018The Milliard Gargantubrain?\u2019 said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. \u2018A mere abacus \u2013 mention it not.\u2019 \u2018And are you not,\u2019 said Fook, leaning anxiously forward, \u2018a greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?\u2019 \u2018A five week sand blizzard?\u2019 said Deep Thought haughtily. \u2018You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff.\u2019 The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then Lunkwill leaned forward again. \u2018But are you not,\u2019 he said, \u2018a more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus Twelve, the Magic and Indefatigable?\u2019 \u2018The Great Hyperlobic Omni Cognate Neutron Wrangler,\u2019 said Deep Thought, thoroughly rolling the rs, \u2018could talk all four legs off an Arcturan Mega donkey \u2013 but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.\u2019 \u2018Then what,\u2019 asked Fook, \u2018is the problem?\u2019 \u2018There is no problem,\u2019 said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones. \u2018I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.\u2019 \u2018But the second?\u2019 insisted Lunkwill. \u2018Why do you keep saying the second? You\u2019re surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller, are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the...\u2019 Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer\u2019s console. \u2018I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic simpletons!\u2019 he boomed. \u2018I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me!\u2019 Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and muttered, \u2018I think this is getting needlessly messianic.\u2019 \u2018You know nothing of future time,\u2019 pronounced Deep Thought, \u2018and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to design.\u2019 Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill. \u2018Can we get on and ask the question?\u2019 he said. Lunkwill motioned him to wait. \u2018What computer is this of which you speak?\u2019 he asked. \u2018I will speak of it no further in this present time,\u2019 said Deep Thought. \u2018Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function. Speak.\u2019 They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself. \u2018O Deep Thought Computer,\u2019 he said, \u2018the task we have designed you to perform is this. We want you to tell us...\u2019 he paused \u2018... the Answer!\u2019 \u2018The Answer?\u2019 said Deep Thought. \u2018The Answer to what?\u2019 \u2018Life!\u2019 urged Fook. \u2018The Universe!\u2019 said Lunkwill. \u2018Everything!\u2019 they said in chorus. Deep Thought paused for a moment\u2019s reflection. \u2018Tricky,\u2019 he said finally. \u2018But can you do it?\u2019 Again, a significant pause. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Deep Thought, \u2018I can do it.\u2019 \u2018There is an answer?\u2019 said Fook with breathless excitement. \u2018A simple answer?\u2019 added Lunkwill. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Deep Thought. \u2018Life, the Universe and Everything. There is an answer. But,\u2019 he added, \u2018I\u2019ll have to think about it.\u2019 A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open and two angry men wearing the coarse faded blue robes and belts of the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way. \u2018We demand admission!\u2019 shouted the younger of the two men, elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat. \u2018Come on,\u2019 shouted the older one, \u2018you can\u2019t keep us out!\u2019 He pushed a junior programmer back through the door. \u2018We demand that you can\u2019t keep us out!\u2019 bawled the younger one, though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts were being made to stop him. \u2018Who are you?\u2019 said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. \u2018What do you want?\u2019 \u2018I am Majikthise!\u2019 announced the older one. \u2018And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!\u2019 shouted the younger one. Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. \u2018It\u2019s all right,\u2019 he explained angrily, \u2018you don\u2019t need to demand that.\u2019 \u2018All right!\u2019 bawled Vroomfondel banging on a nearby desk. \u2018I am Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What we demand is solid facts!\u2019 \u2018No we don\u2019t!\u2019 exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. \u2018That is precisely what we don\u2019t demand!\u2019 Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, \u2018We don\u2019t demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!\u2019 \u2018But who the devil are you?\u2019 exclaimed an outraged Fook. \u2018We,\u2019 said Majikthise, \u2018are Philosophers.\u2019 \u2018Though we may not be,\u2019 said Vroomfondel, waving a warning finger at the programmers. \u2018Yes we are,\u2019 insisted Majikthise. \u2018We are quite definitely here as representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this machine off, and we want it off now!\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019 said Lunkwill. \u2018I\u2019ll tell you what the problem is, mate,\u2019 said Majikthise, \u2018demarcation, that\u2019s the problem!\u2019 \u2018We demand,\u2019 yelled Vroomfondel, \u2018that demarcation may or may not be the problem!\u2019 \u2018You just let the machines get on with the adding up,\u2019 warned Majikthise, \u2018and we\u2019ll take care of the eternal verities, thank you very much. You want to check your legal position you do, mate. Under law the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody machine goes and actually finds it and we\u2019re straight out of a job, aren\u2019t we? I mean what\u2019s the use of our sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine only goes and gives you his bleeding phone number the next morning?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 shouted Vroomfondel, \u2018we demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!\u2019 Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room. \u2018Might I make an observation at this point?\u2019 enquired Deep Thought. \u2018We\u2019ll go on strike!\u2019 yelled Vroomfondel. \u2018That\u2019s right!\u2019 agreed Majikthise. \u2018You\u2019ll have a national Philosophers\u2019 strike on your hands!\u2019 The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary bass driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought\u2019s voice a little more power. \u2018All I wanted to say,\u2019 bellowed the computer, \u2018is that my circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answers to the Ultimate question of Life, the Universe and Everything \u2013\u2019 he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone\u2019s attention, before continuing more quietly \u2013 \u2018but the program will take me a little while to run.\u2019 Fook glanced impatiently at his watch. \u2018How long?\u2019 he said. \u2018Seven and a half million years,\u2019 said Deep Thought. Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other. \u2018Seven and a half million years!\u2019 they cried in chorus. \u2018Yes,\u2019 declaimed Deep Thought, \u2018I said I\u2019d have to think about it, didn\u2019t I? And it occurs to me that running a program like this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity for the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone\u2019s going to have their own theories about what answer I\u2019m eventually going to come up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market than you yourselves? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular press, and so long as you have clever agents, you can keep yourselves on the gravy train for life. How does that sound?\u2019 The two philosophers gaped at him. \u2018Bloody hell,\u2019 said Majikthise, \u2018now that is what I call thinking. Here, Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like that?\u2019 \u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper. \u2018Think our brains must be too highly trained, Majikthise.\u2019 So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams. 26 \u2018Yes, very salutary,\u2019 said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had related the salient points of this story to him, \u2018but I don\u2019t understand what all this has got to do with the Earth and mice and things.\u2019 \u2018That is but the first half of the story, Earthman,\u2019 said the old man. \u2018If you would care to discover what happened seven and a half million years later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to invite you to my study where you can experience the events yourself on our Sens O Tape records. That is unless you would care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It\u2019s only half completed, I\u2019m afraid \u2013 we haven\u2019t even finished burying the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have the Tertiary and Quaternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era to lay down, and...\u2019 \u2018No thank you,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it wouldn\u2019t be quite the same.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018it won\u2019t be.\u2019 And he turned the aircar round and headed back towards the mind numbing wall. 27 Slartibartfast\u2019s study was a total mess, like the results of an explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they stepped in. \u2018Terribly unfortunate,\u2019 he said, \u2018a diode blew in one of the life support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning staff we discovered they\u2019d been dead for nearly thirty thousand years. Who\u2019s going to clear away the bodies, that\u2019s what I want to know. Look, why don\u2019t you sit yourself down over there and let me plug you in?\u2019 He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been made out of the ribcage of a stegosaurus. \u2018It was made out of the ribcage of a stegosaurus,\u2019 explained the old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. \u2018Here,\u2019 he said, \u2018hold these,\u2019 and passed a couple of stripped wire ends to Arthur. The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through him. He was suspended in mid air and totally invisible to himself. Beneath him was a pretty tree lined city square, and all around it as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear \u2013 many were cracked and stained with rain. Today, however, the sun was shining, a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets around it were thronged with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air. Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it all without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called for everyone\u2019s attention. A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over a Tannoy. \u2018O people who wait in the shadow of Deep Thought!\u2019 he cried out. \u2018Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known... The Time of Waiting is over!\u2019 Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically waving their legs in the air. \u2018Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day!\u2019 cried the cheer leader. \u2018The Day of the Answer!\u2019 Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd. \u2018Never again,\u2019 cried the man, \u2018never again will we wake up in the morning and think: Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don\u2019t get up and go to work? For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!\u2019 As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd. He experienced a moment\u2019s panic as he sailed straight towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it. No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is hardly surprising as he wasn\u2019t there. He began to realize that the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which knocked six track seventy millimetre into a cocked hat. The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven and a half million years it had been well looked after and cleaned regularly every century or so. The ultramahogany desk was worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk\u2019s leather top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday. Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and waited. \u2018The time is nearly upon us,\u2019 said one, and Arthur was surprised to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man\u2019s neck. The word was LOON QUAWL, and it flashed a couple of times and then disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate this the other man spoke and the word PHOUCHG appeared by his neck. \u2018Seventy five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this program in motion,\u2019 the second man said, \u2018and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak.\u2019 \u2018An awesome prospect, Phouchg,\u2019 agreed the first man, and Arthur suddenly realized he was watching a recording with subtitles. \u2018We are the ones who will hear,\u2019 said Phouchg, \u2018the answer to the great question of Life...\u2019 \u2018The Universe...\u2019 said Loonquawl. \u2018And Everything...!\u2019 \u2018Shhh,\u2019 said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, \u2018I think Deep Thought is preparing to speak!\u2019 There was a moment\u2019s expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication channel. \u2018Good morning,\u2019 said Deep Thought at last. \u2018Er... Good morning, O Deep Thought,\u2019 said Loon quawl nervously, \u2018do you have... er, that is...\u2019 \u2018An answer for you?\u2019 interrupted Deep Thought majestically. \u2018Yes. I have.\u2019 The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been in vain. \u2018There really is one?\u2019 breathed Phouchg. \u2018There really is one,\u2019 confirmed Deep Thought. \u2018To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited children. \u2018And you\u2019re ready to give it to us?\u2019 urged Loon quawl. \u2018I am.\u2019 \u2018Now?\u2019 \u2018Now,\u2019 said Deep Thought. They both licked their dry lips. \u2018Though I don\u2019t think,\u2019 added Deep Thought, \u2018that you\u2019re going to like it.\u2019 \u2018Doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 said Phouchg. \u2018We must know it! Now!\u2019 \u2018Now?\u2019 enquired Deep Thought. \u2018Yes! Now...\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said the computer and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable. \u2018You\u2019re really not going to like it,\u2019 observed Deep Thought. \u2018Tell us!\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said Deep Thought. \u2018The Answer to the Great Question...\u2019 \u2018Yes...!\u2019 \u2018Of Life, the Universe and Everything...\u2019 said Deep Thought. \u2018Yes...!\u2019 \u2018Is...\u2019 said Deep Thought, and paused. \u2018Yes...!\u2019 \u2018Is...\u2019 \u2018Yes... !!!...?\u2019 \u2018Forty two,\u2019 said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm. 28 It was a long time before anyone spoke. Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense expectant faces down in the square outside. \u2018We\u2019re going to get lynched, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 he whispered. \u2018It was a tough assignment,\u2019 said Deep Thought mildly. \u2018Forty two!\u2019 yelled Loonquawl. \u2018Is that all you\u2019ve got to show for seven and a half million years\u2019 work?\u2019 \u2018I checked it very thoroughly,\u2019 said the computer, \u2018and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you\u2019ve never actually known what the question is.\u2019 \u2018But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything!\u2019 howled Loonquawl. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, \u2018but what actually is it?\u2019 A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other. \u2018Well, you know, it\u2019s just Everything... Everything...\u2019 offered Phouchg weakly. \u2018Exactly!\u2019 said Deep Thought. \u2018So once you do know what the question actually is, you\u2019ll know what the answer means.\u2019 \u2018Oh, terrific,\u2019 muttered Phouchg, flinging aside his notebook and wiping away a tiny tear. \u2018Look, all right, all right,\u2019 said Loonquawl, \u2018can you just please tell us the question?\u2019 \u2018The Ultimate Question?\u2019 \u2018Yes!\u2019 \u2018Of Life, the Universe and Everything?\u2019 \u2018Yes!\u2019 Deep Thought pondered for a moment. \u2018Tricky,\u2019 he said. \u2018But can you do it?\u2019 cried Loonquawl. Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment. Finally: \u2018No,\u2019 he said firmly. Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair. \u2018But I\u2019ll tell you who can,\u2019 said Deep Thought. They both looked up sharply. \u2018Who? Tell us!\u2019 Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently nonexistent scalp begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on the part of whoever had made the recording, he assumed. \u2018I speak of none but the computer that is to come after me,\u2019 intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed declamatory tones. \u2018A computer whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate \u2013 and yet I will design it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall name it also unto you. And it shall be called... The Earth.\u2019 Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought. \u2018What a dull name,\u2019 he said and great incisions appeared down the length of his body. Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific gashes from nowhere. The computer console blotched and cracked, the walls flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards into its own ceiling... Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two wires. \u2018End of the tape,\u2019 he explained. 29 \u2018Zaphod! Wake up!\u2019 \u2018Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?\u2019 \u2018Hey, come on, wake up.\u2019 \u2018Just let me stick to what I\u2019m good at, yeah?\u2019 muttered Zaphod and rolled away from the voice back to sleep. \u2018Do you want me to kick you?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Would it give you a lot of pleasure?\u2019 said Zaphod, blearily. \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Nor me. So what\u2019s the point? Stop bugging me.\u2019 Zaphod curled himself up. \u2018He got a double dose of the gas,\u2019 said Trillian looking down at him, \u2018two windpipes.\u2019 \u2018And stop talking,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018it\u2019s hard enough trying to sleep anyway. What\u2019s the matter with the ground? It\u2019s all cold and hard.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s gold,\u2019 said Ford. With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It gleamed like... it\u2019s impossible to say what it gleamed like because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that a planet made of solid gold does. \u2018Who put all that there?\u2019 yelped Zaphod, goggle eyed. \u2018Don\u2019t get excited,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018it\u2019s only a catalogue.\u2019 \u2018A who?\u2019 \u2018A catalogue,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018an illusion.\u2019 \u2018How can you say that?\u2019 cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it. It was very heavy and very slightly soft \u2013 he could mark it with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off solid gold. \u2018Trillian and I came round a while ago,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018We shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all Sens O Tape.\u2019 Zaphod stared at him bitterly. \u2018Ah, shit,\u2019 he said, \u2018you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else\u2019s.\u2019 He sat down in a huff. \u2018What\u2019s that series of valleys over there?\u2019 he said. \u2018Hallmark,\u2019 said Ford. \u2018We had a look.\u2019 \u2018We didn\u2019t wake you earlier,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018The last planet was knee deep in fish.\u2019 \u2018Fish?\u2019 \u2018Some people like the oddest things.\u2019 \u2018And before that,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we had platinum. Bit dull. We thought you\u2019d like to see this one, though.\u2019 Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked. \u2018Very pretty,\u2019 said Zaphod petulantly. In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land. As with one voice they all went, \u2018Yuch.\u2019 The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles \u2013 presumably terribly precious stones. The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks. Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassels. In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number. It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We are not proud. And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes. In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows. \u2018Ow!\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018My brains!\u2019 \u2018You want to talk about it?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Yeah, OK,\u2019 said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the scenes that came and went around them. \u2018I figure this,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Whatever happened to my mind, I did it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn\u2019t be detected by the government screening tests. And I wasn\u2019t to know anything about it myself. Pretty crazy, right?\u2019 The other two nodded in agreement. \u2018So I reckon, what\u2019s so secret that I can\u2019t let anybody know I know it, not the galactic government, not even myself? And the answer is I don\u2019t know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and I can begin to guess. When did I decide to run for President? Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx. You remember Yooden, Ford?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018he was that guy we met when we were kids, the Arcturan captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you busted your way into his mega freighter. Said you were the most amazing kid he\u2019d ever met.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s all this?\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Ancient history,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018when we were kids together on Betelgeuse. The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the bulky trade between the galactic centre and the outlying regions. The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to galactic science. They were real brutes of ships, and huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun. \u2018One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one. On a tri jet scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid. I mean forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride because I\u2019d got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn\u2019t want him coming back with fake evidence. So what happens? We get in this tri jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, burst our way into a megafreighter I still don\u2019t know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers. A wilder thing I have not known. Lost me a year\u2019s pocket money. For what? Conkers.\u2019 \u2018The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018He gave us food, booze \u2013 stuff from really weird parts of the Galaxy \u2013 lots of conkers, of course, and we had just the most incredible time. Then he teleported us back. Into the maximum security wing of the Betelgeuse state prison. He was a cool guy. Went on to become President of the Galaxy.\u2019 Zaphod paused. The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings. Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition. \u2018Ford,\u2019 said Zaphod quietly. \u2018Yeah?\u2019 \u2018Just before Yooden died he came to see me.\u2019 \u2018What? You never told me.\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018What did he say? What did he come to see you about?\u2019 \u2018He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I should steal it.\u2019 \u2018His idea?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018and the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony.\u2019 Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter. \u2018Are you telling me,\u2019 he said, \u2018that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls. \u2018But why?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018What\u2019s so important about having it?\u2019 \u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I think if I\u2019d consciously known what was so important about it and what I would need it for it would have shown up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed. I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away.\u2019 \u2018So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of Yooden talking to you?\u2019 \u2018He was a hell of a talker.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself, you know.\u2019 Zaphod shrugged. \u2018I mean, don\u2019t you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?\u2019 asked Ford. Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his mind. \u2018No,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018I don\u2019t seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets. Still,\u2019 he added on further reflection, \u2018I can understand that. I wouldn\u2019t trust myself further than I could spit a rat.\u2019 A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again. They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass top tables and design awards. A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them. \u2018The mice will see you now,\u2019 he said. 30 \u2018So there you have it,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study. He picked up a piece of paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else to put it, so he put it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over. \u2018Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it.\u2019 \u2018And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed,\u2019 added Arthur, not unbitterly. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the room. \u2018Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that. Ten million years, Earthman... can you conceive of that kind of time span? A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time. Gone.\u2019 He paused. \u2018Well, that\u2019s bureaucracy for you,\u2019 he added. \u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur thoughtfully, \u2018all this explains a lot of things. All through my life I\u2019ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018that\u2019s just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the Universe has that.\u2019 \u2018Everyone?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know...\u2019 \u2018Maybe. Who cares?\u2019 said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited. \u2018Perhaps I\u2019m old and tired,\u2019 he continued, \u2018but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design coastlines. I got an award for Norway.\u2019 He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large Perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it. \u2018Where\u2019s the sense in that?\u2019 he said. \u2018None that I\u2019ve been able to make out. I\u2019ve been doing fjords all my life. For a fleeting moment they became fashionable and I get a major award.\u2019 He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn\u2019t land on something soft. \u2018In this replacement Earth we\u2019re building they\u2019ve given me Africa to do and of course I\u2019m doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I\u2019m old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent. And they tell me it\u2019s not equatorial enough. Equatorial!\u2019 He gave a hollow laugh. \u2018What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things, of course, but I\u2019d far rather be happy than right any day.\u2019 \u2018And are you?\u2019 \u2018No. That\u2019s where it all falls down, of course.\u2019 \u2018Pity,\u2019 said Arthur with sympathy. \u2018It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise.\u2019 Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed. \u2018Come,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018you are to meet the mice. Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement. It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe.\u2019 \u2018What were the first two?\u2019 \u2018Oh, probably just coincidences,\u2019 said Slartibartfast carelessly. He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow. Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning. \u2018I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,\u2019 he muttered to himself. \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 asked the old man mildly. \u2018Oh nothing,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018only joking.\u2019 31 It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated. For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said \u2018I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,\u2019 a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space\u2013time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle. The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time. A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl\u2019hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G\u2019Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother. The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table. Unfortunately, in the Vl\u2019hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries. Eventually of course, after their galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own galaxy \u2013 now positively identified as the source of the offending remark. For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across \u2013 which happened to be the Earth \u2013 where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog. Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it. \u2018It\u2019s just life,\u2019 they say. A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass topped tables and Perspex awards. Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered. \u2018Arthur! You\u2019re safe!\u2019 a voice said. \u2018Am I?\u2019 said Arthur, rather startled. \u2018Oh good.\u2019 The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits. They were stuffing their faces. \u2018What happened to you?\u2019 demanded Arthur. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, \u2018our guests here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us. Here,\u2019 he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, \u2018have some Vegan rhino\u2019s cutlet. It\u2019s delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing.\u2019 \u2018Hosts?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018What hosts? I don\u2019t see any...\u2019 A small voice said, \u2018Welcome to lunch, Earth creature.\u2019 Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped. \u2018Ugh!\u2019 he said. \u2018There are mice on the table!\u2019 There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur. He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone. \u2018Oh!\u2019 he said, with sudden realization. \u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for...\u2019 \u2018Let me introduce you,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018Arthur, this is Benjy mouse.\u2019 \u2018Hi,\u2019 said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky glass like affair, and it moved forward slightly. \u2018And this is Frankie mouse.\u2019 The other mouse said, \u2018Pleased to meet you,\u2019 and did likewise. Arthur gaped. \u2018But aren\u2019t they...\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018they are the mice I brought with me from the Earth.\u2019 She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug. \u2018Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?\u2019 she said. Slartibartfast coughed politely. \u2018Er, excuse me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Yes, thank you, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Benjy mouse sharply, \u2018you may go.\u2019 \u2018What? Oh... er, very well,\u2019 said the old man, slightly taken aback. \u2018I\u2019ll just go and get on with some of my fjords then.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well in fact that won\u2019t be necessary,\u2019 said Frankie mouse. \u2018It looks very much as if we won\u2019t be needing the new Earth any longer.\u2019 He swivelled his pink little eyes. \u2018Not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 cried Slartibartfast, aghast. \u2018You can\u2019t mean that! I\u2019ve got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!\u2019 \u2018Well, perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them,\u2019 said Frankie, acidly. \u2018Skiing holiday!\u2019 cried the old man. \u2018Those glaciers are works of art! Elegantly sculpted contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!\u2019 \u2018Thank you, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Benjy firmly. \u2018That will be all.\u2019 \u2018Yes sir,\u2019 said the old man coldly, \u2018thank you very much. Well, goodbye, Earthman,\u2019 he said to Arthur, \u2018hope the lifestyle comes together.\u2019 With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room. Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say. \u2018Now,\u2019 said Benjy mouse, \u2018to business.\u2019 Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together. \u2018To business!\u2019 they said. \u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 said Benjy. Ford looked round. \u2018Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast,\u2019 he said. The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports. Finally they composed themselves, and Benjy moved forward to address Arthur. \u2018Now, Earth creature,\u2019 he said, \u2018the situation we have in effect is this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said Arthur, sharply. \u2018No \u2013 we already thought of that one,\u2019 said Frankie interrupting, \u2018but it doesn\u2019t fit the answer. Why? \u2013 Forty Two... you see, it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I mean why have you been doing it?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I see,\u2019 said Frankie. \u2018Well, eventually just habit, I think, to be brutally honest. And this is more or less the point \u2013 we\u2019re sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benjy and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends.\u2019 \u2018Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension,\u2019 put in Benjy. \u2018Since when,\u2019 continued his murine colleague, \u2018we have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we\u2019re very much inclined to take it.\u2019 \u2018I would, wouldn\u2019t you, Ford?\u2019 said Zaphod promptingly. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018jump at it, like a shot.\u2019 Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to. \u2018But we\u2019ve got to have product, you see,\u2019 said Frankie. \u2018I mean ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other.\u2019 Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur. \u2018You see,\u2019 he said, \u2018if they\u2019re just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then eventually have to admit that in fact it\u2019s Forty two, then the show\u2019s probably quite short. No follow up, you see.\u2019 \u2018We have to have something that sounds good,\u2019 said Benjy. \u2018Something that sounds good?\u2019 exclaimed Arthur. \u2018An Ultimate Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?\u2019 The mice bristled. \u2018Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I\u2019m afraid where you begin to suspect that if there\u2019s any real truth, it\u2019s that the entire multi dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs. And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise,\u2019 said Frankie. \u2018But...\u2019 started Arthur, hopelessly. \u2018Hey, will you get this, Earthman,\u2019 interrupted Zaphod. \u2018You are a last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?\u2019 \u2018Er...\u2019 \u2018So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer program,\u2019 said Ford, rather lucidly he thought. \u2018Right?\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn\u2019t aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one of his problems. \u2018In other words,\u2019 said Benjy, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, \u2018there\u2019s a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain \u2013 so we want to buy it off you.\u2019 \u2018What, the question?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford and Trillian. \u2018For lots of money,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018No, no,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018it\u2019s the brain we want to buy.\u2019 \u2018What!\u2019 \u2018Well, who would miss it?\u2019 enquired Benjy. \u2018I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically,\u2019 protested Ford. \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018but we\u2019d have to get it out first. It\u2019s got to be prepared.\u2019 \u2018Treated,\u2019 said Benjy. \u2018Diced.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror. \u2018It could always be replaced,\u2019 said Benjy reasonably, \u2018if you think it\u2019s important.\u2019 \u2018Yes, an electronic brain,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018a simple one would suffice.\u2019 \u2018A simple one!\u2019 wailed Arthur. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, \u2018you\u2019d just have to program it to say What? and I don\u2019t understand and Where\u2019s the tea? \u2013 who\u2019d know the difference?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 cried Arthur, backing away still further. \u2018See what I mean?\u2019 said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something Trillian did at that moment. \u2018I\u2019d notice the difference,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018No you wouldn\u2019t,\u2019 said Frankie mouse, \u2018you\u2019d be programmed not to.\u2019 Ford made for the door. \u2018Look, I\u2019m sorry, mice old lads,\u2019 he said, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a deal.\u2019 \u2018I rather think we have to have a deal,\u2019 said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing from their piping little voices in an instant. With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything. Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, but Arthur was a dead weight \u2013 he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him. She screamed at him, but he just gaped. With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty. They charged. So \u2013 Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were. All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din. 32 \u2018Emergency! Emergency!\u2019 blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea. \u2018Hostile ship has landed on planet. Armed intruders in section 8A. Defence stations, defence stations.\u2019 The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on the floor. \u2018Damnation,\u2019 muttered Frankie mouse, \u2018all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain.\u2019 He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static. \u2018The only thing we can do now,\u2019 said Benjy, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, \u2018is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible.\u2019 \u2018Difficult,\u2019 said Frankie. He thought. \u2018How about, What\u2019s yellow and dangerous?\u2019 Benjy considered this for a moment. \u2018No, no good,\u2019 he said. \u2018Doesn\u2019t fit the answer.\u2019 They sank into silence for a few seconds. \u2018All right,\u2019 said Benjy. \u2018What do you get if you multiply six by seven?\u2019 \u2018No, no, too literal, too factual,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018wouldn\u2019t sustain the punters\u2019 interest.\u2019 Again they thought. Then Frankie said: \u2018Here\u2019s a thought. How many roads must a man walk down?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Benjy. \u2018Aha, now that does sound promising!\u2019 He rolled the phrase around a little. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down? Forty two. Excellent, excellent, that\u2019ll fox \u2019em. Frankie baby, we are made!\u2019 They performed a scampering dance in their excitement. Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards. Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out. They emerged into a wide open plan computer bay. They glanced about wildly. \u2018Which way you reckon, Zaphod?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018At a wild guess, I\u2019d say down here,\u2019 said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall. As the others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill O Zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall. A voice on a loud hailer said, \u2018OK, Beeblebrox, hold it right there. We\u2019ve got you covered.\u2019 \u2018Cops!\u2019 hissed Zaphod, and spun around in a crouch. \u2018You want to try a guess at all, Ford?\u2019 \u2018OK, this way,\u2019 said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks. At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space suited figure waving a vicious Kill O Zap gun. \u2018We don\u2019t want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!\u2019 shouted the figure. \u2018Suits me fine!\u2019 shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units. The others swerved in behind him. \u2018There are two of them,\u2019 said Trillian. \u2018We\u2019re cornered.\u2019 They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall. They held their breath and waited. Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously. \u2018Hey, they\u2019re shooting at us,\u2019 said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball. \u2018I thought they said they didn\u2019t want to do that.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I thought they said that,\u2019 agreed Ford. Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. \u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, \u2018I thought you said you didn\u2019t want to shoot us!\u2019 and ducked again. They waited. After a moment a voice replied, \u2018It isn\u2019t easy being a cop!\u2019 \u2018What did he say?\u2019 whispered Ford in astonishment. \u2018He said it isn\u2019t easy being a cop.\u2019 \u2018Well surely that\u2019s his problem, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d have thought so.\u2019 Ford shouted out, \u2018Hey, listen! I think we\u2019ve got enough problems of our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we\u2019d all find it easier to cope!\u2019 Another pause, and then the loud hailer again. \u2018Now see here, guy,\u2019 said the voice on the loud hailer, \u2018you\u2019re not dealing with any dumb two bit trigger pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we\u2019re a couple of intelligent caring guys that you\u2019d probably quite like if you met us socially! I don\u2019t go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space rangers\u2019 bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!\u2019 \u2018And I write novels!\u2019 chimed in the other cop. \u2018Though I haven\u2019t had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I\u2019m in a meeeean mood!\u2019 Ford\u2019s eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. \u2018Who are these guys?\u2019 he said. \u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018I think I preferred it when they were shooting.\u2019 \u2018So are you going to come quietly,\u2019 shouted one of the cops again, \u2018or are you going to let us blast you out?\u2019 \u2018Which would you prefer?\u2019 shouted Ford. A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill O Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them. The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity. When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness as the echoes die away. \u2018You still there?\u2019 called one of the cops. \u2018Yes,\u2019 they called back. \u2018We didn\u2019t enjoy doing that at all,\u2019 shouted the other cop. \u2018We could tell,\u2019 shouted Ford. \u2018Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 shouted back Zaphod. \u2018Because,\u2019 shouted the cop, \u2018it\u2019s going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and humane! Now \u2013 either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here!\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s crazy!\u2019 cried Trillian. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t do that!\u2019 \u2018Oh yes we would,\u2019 shouted the cop, \u2018wouldn\u2019t we?\u2019 he asked the other one. \u2018Oh yes, we\u2019d have to, no question,\u2019 the other one called back. \u2018But why?\u2019 demanded Trillian. \u2018Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything!\u2019 \u2018I just don\u2019t believe these guys,\u2019 muttered Ford, shaking his head. One cop shouted to the other, \u2018Shall we shoot them again for a bit?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, why not?\u2019 They let fly another electric barrage. The heat and noise were quite fantastic. Slowly the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back and waited for the end. 33 But the end never came, at least not then. Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds. The four stared at each other. \u2018What happened?\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018They stopped,\u2019 said Zaphod with a shrug. \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 They waited. \u2018Hello?\u2019 called out Ford. No answer. \u2018That\u2019s odd.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps it\u2019s a trap.\u2019 \u2018They haven\u2019t the wit.\u2019 \u2018What were those thuds?\u2019 \u2018Dunno.\u2019 They waited for a few more seconds. \u2018Right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019m going to have a look.\u2019 He glanced round at the others. \u2018Is no one going to say, No you can\u2019t possibly, let me go instead?\u2019 They all shook their heads. \u2018Oh well,\u2019 he said, and stood up. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer. Cautiously he stepped out into the open. Still nothing happened. Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space suited figure of one of the cops. He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man. No one else was anywhere to be seen. This struck Ford as being extremely odd. Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill O Zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers. He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance. The cop was quite clearly dead. A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa \u2013 he was a methane breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea. The tiny life support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up. Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These miniature suit computers usually had the full back up of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the subetha. Such a system was fail safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of. He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously. He called the others over to look. They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity. \u2018Let\u2019s get shot of this hole,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018If whatever I\u2019m supposed to be looking for is here, I don\u2019t want it.\u2019 He grabbed the second Kill O Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others. He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away. The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibartfast. It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls. It said This is probably the best button to press. 34 The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that led out on to the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey light congealed on the land. R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquillity this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast. The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own. Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship. Beside it stood another one. It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The letters informed anyone who cared to read them where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected. It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two man crew was at that moment lying asphyxiated in a smoke filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead. Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious \u2013 a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his experience the Universe simply didn\u2019t work like that. The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity. Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship. As he walked, he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust. \u2018Marvin!\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t feel you have to take any notice of me, please,\u2019 came a muffled drone. \u2018But how are you, metalman?\u2019 said Ford. \u2018Very depressed.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018I\u2019ve never been there.\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, \u2018are you lying face down in the dust?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a very effective way of being wretched,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018Don\u2019t pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me.\u2019 \u2018No I don\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Yes you do, everybody does. It\u2019s part of the shape of the Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away.\u2019 He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction. \u2018That ship hated me,\u2019 he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft. \u2018That ship?\u2019 said Ford in sudden excitement. \u2018What happened to it? Do you know?\u2019 \u2018It hated me because I talked to it.\u2019 \u2018You talked to it?\u2019 exclaimed Ford. \u2018What do you mean, you talked to it?\u2019 \u2018Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,\u2019 said Marvin. \u2018And what happened?\u2019 pressed Ford. \u2018It committed suicide,\u2019 said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold. 35 That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brains into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to have to live in the place, he reasoned, he\u2019d better start finding out something about it. He came across this entry. It said: \u2018The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Enquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. \u2018For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat?, the second by the question Why do we eat?, and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?\u2019 He got no further before the ship\u2019s intercom buzzed into life. \u2018Hey, Earthman? You hungry, kid?\u2019 said Zaphod\u2019s voice. \u2018Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018OK, baby, hold tight,\u2019 said Zaphod. \u2018We\u2019ll take in a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.\u2019 Enclosed here are samples of original material sourced from the Douglas Adams archives Original Press release for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy Typed up quotes from the Monty Python team Press release about The Golden Pan Award Publicity clippings for The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy Fax from Douglas Adams to US editor Byron Preiss Would you like to continue reading about Arthur Dent and his many adventures across time and space? If so, pick up the story in the next part of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy series. An extract follows here from THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 1 The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This had made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle Six believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle Six and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. For instance, a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty two \u2013 and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet \u2013 especially by the strange ape like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program. And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. Sadly, however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way \u2013 so they claimed \u2013 for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. Or so it would seem. Two of these strange, ape like creatures survived. Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers. Tricia McMillan \u2013 or Trillian \u2013 had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy. Two survivors. They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted \u2013 to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything. And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them. 2 Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protruded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses. In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside it and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born \u2013 or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born. In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn\u2019t even think once. They are simple minded, thick willed, slug brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry. One thing they don\u2019t like is leaving a job unfinished \u2013 particularly this Vogon, and particularly \u2013 for various reasons \u2013 this job. This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he it was who had had the job of demolishing the so called \u2018planet\u2019 Earth. He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned. It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well. It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard. Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested. He had other fish to fry. It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words \u2018integrity\u2019 or \u2018moral rectitude\u2019 he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away. In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over. He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction. \u2018Computer,\u2019 he croaked, \u2018get me my brain care specialist on the line.\u2019 Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as \u2018my private brain care specialist\u2019 there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of the Galaxy\u2019s most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?\u2019 The Vogon Captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise. Halfrunt\u2019s smile did not flicker for an instant. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 rumbled the Vogon, \u2018is what you always say.\u2019 \u2018Well again,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me, what news of the mission?\u2019 \u2018We have located the ship.\u2019 \u2018Wonderful,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018wonderful! And the occupants?\u2019 \u2018The Earthman is there.\u2019 \u2018Excellent! And...?\u2019 \u2018A female from the same planet. They are the last.\u2019 \u2018Good, good,\u2019 beamed Halfrunt. \u2018Who else?\u2019 \u2018The man Prefect.\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018And Zaphod Beeblebrox.\u2019 For an instant Halfrunt\u2019s smile flickered. \u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I had been expecting this. It is most regrettable.\u2019 \u2018A personal friend?\u2019 enquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out. \u2018Ah, no,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018in my profession, you know, we do not make personal friends.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 grunted the Vogon, \u2018professional detachment.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Halfrunt cheerfully \u2018we just don\u2019t have the knack.\u2019 He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly. \u2018But Beeblebrox, you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018he is one of my most profitable clients. He has personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts.\u2019 He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it. \u2018Still,\u2019 he said, \u2018you are ready for your task?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Good. Destroy the ship immediately.\u2019 \u2018What about Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Halfrunt brightly, \u2018Zaphod\u2019s just this guy, you know?\u2019 He vanished from the screen. The Vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew. \u2018Attack,\u2019 he said. At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship\u2019s computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the Improbability factors with a pencil. The Heart of Gold\u2019s Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it couldn\u2019t do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen. He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it. He didn\u2019t know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it. He didn\u2019t know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be. He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains. He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time. At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry. \u2018Starpox!\u2019 he shouted. At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air. This was not because of anything wrong with the ship\u2019s artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stairwell which led to the ship\u2019s personal cabins. It was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod\u2019s door and explained what was on his mind. \u2018Vogons,\u2019 he said. A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism, because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was called a Nutri Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before. It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid which was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. He attempted to reason with the thing. \u2018Tea,\u2019 he said. \u2018Share and Enjoy,\u2019 the machine repeated and produced another one. \u2018Share and Enjoy\u2019 is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years. The motto stands \u2013 or rather stood \u2013 in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadraz. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives \u2013 now deceased. The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read \u2018Go stick your head in a pig\u2019, and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration. Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid. \u2018Listen, you machine,\u2019 he said, \u2018you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?\u2019 \u2018Nutrition and pleasurable sense data,\u2019 burbled the machine. \u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018It tastes filthy!\u2019 \u2018If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink,\u2019 continued the machine, \u2018why not share it with your friends?\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 said Arthur tartly, \u2018I want to keep them. Will you try to comprehend what I\u2019m telling you? That drink...\u2019 \u2018That drink,\u2019 said the machine sweetly, \u2018was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018so I\u2019m a masochist on a diet, am I?\u2019 \u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up.\u2019 \u2018Will that be all?\u2019 Arthur decided to give up. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said. Then he decided he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d give up. \u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018look, it\u2019s very, very simple... all I want... is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and listen.\u2019 And he sat. He told the Nutri Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn\u2019t get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company. \u2018So that\u2019s it, is it?\u2019 said the Nutri Matic when he had finished. \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that is what I want.\u2019 \u2018You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?\u2019 \u2018Er, yes. With milk.\u2019 \u2018Squirted out of a cow?\u2019 \u2018Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to need some help with this one,\u2019 said the machine tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business. \u2018Well, anything I can do,\u2019 said Arthur. \u2018You\u2019ve done quite enough,\u2019 the Nutri Matic informed him. It summoned up the ship\u2019s computer. \u2018Hi there!\u2019 said the ship\u2019s computer. The Nutri Matic explained about tea to the ship\u2019s computer. The computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri Matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence. Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened. He thumped it, but still nothing happened. Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge. In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still. Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.

The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been for many centuries. In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in a stasis field which keeps him in a state of perpetual unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means that without any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and effectively moved a rung or two down the ladder, and is now seen to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to the Emperor \u2013 an elected governmental assembly headed by a President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such place. The President in particular is very much a figurehead \u2013 he wields no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the government, but the qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the Galaxy has ever had \u2013 he has already spent two of his ten presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people realize that the President and the government have virtually no power at all, and of these few people only six know whence ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly believe that the ultimate decision making process is handled by a computer. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong. * Ford Prefect\u2019s original name is only pronounceable in an obscure Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster of Gal./Sid./Year 03758 which wiped out all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. Ford\u2019s father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the Great Collapsing Hrung Disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that he was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung was nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven particularly. Ford\u2019s father, magnanimously waving aside the clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled Ford; in memory of his now dead race he christened him in the ancient Praxibetel tongue. Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as \u2018boy who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven\u2019.

        "I can remember only two.",
        "One, in Junior School, when the Deputy Head told us that the PG chimps were paid more than the workers picking the tea leaves (good man!), and two, in the autumn of 1979, when Margaret Iles and Suzanne Couling stood up, in Olchfa Comprehensive School, Swansea, and read out the end of Chapter Eighteen of this very book.",
        "Ah, the bowl of petunias, and the whale.",
        "\u2018Oh no, not again.\u2019 And we sat up.",
        "We listened.",
        "We laughed.",
        "For once, we felt part of an assembly, because we knew this stuff.",
        "It was a rare moment for teenagers: a shared knowledge of a piece of writing, a shared love.",
        "Because, back then, in those days of post punk and Green Flash and Anti Nazi League badges, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy was something truly unique.",
        "It was cool.",
        "\u2018Cool\u2019 is a horrible word.",
        "Too close to cold.",
        "It smacks of the beautiful elite.",
        "But this book was cool in the best way \u2013 wise and true and subversive and, most importantly, forging a connection between people.",
        "And here I mean the paperback specifically.",
        "Sure, lots of us loved the radio series, and strained to listen to Radio 4 on Long Wave, but there was just something so special about having all that brilliance, and all those jokes, in book form.",
        "It was so portable.",
        "So available.",
        "So ready to be passed around.",
        "In my whole life, I can\u2019t remember a book being so shared.",
        "We owned it, with pride, so many of us \u2013 not just the elite, but the whole range, from swots to rugby boys, from girl gangs to young offenders, the tall, the short and the lonely, let alone that vast majority of kids with no label.",
        "We carried it around, like an iPod, like cigarettes, like a Gideon\u2019s Bible.",
        "You\u2019d see that novel, with its cover like neon left out in the rain, jutting out of back pockets and school bags, clutched like a shield, passed from hand to hand like an initiation.",
        "Okay, maybe Harry Potter had a similar moment of glory.",
        "But you could never fit that into your back pocket.",
        "(This new edition still fits, I just checked.) Because that\u2019s what I loved about this version of Hitchhiker\u2019s, above any other; the soft, bendy, riffable paperbackness of it.",
        "It\u2019s vital to remember how much Douglas Adams can mean to kids.",
        "As time passes, Hitchhiker\u2019s can acquire something of an elevated air, straddling Oxbridge and Hollywood.",
        "But this thing belongs to the playground! When you\u2019re young, and just emerging from the four walls of home into the wide world outside, that\u2019s exactly when you feel so small, like Arthur Dent, all alone in the universe.",
        "That\u2019s when you act as wildly two headed as Zaphod.",
        "That\u2019s when you really need someone to say \u2018Don\u2019t Panic\u2019.",
        "It\u2019s the perfect age to mutter a heartfelt \u2018Oh no, not again,\u2019 a phrase so much wiser than today\u2019s \u2018Whatever\u2019.",
        "When we laughed out loud at the poor petunias\u2019 punchline, way back in 1979, it wasn\u2019t just because it was funny.",
        "It was because we agreed.",
        "I don\u2019t think Douglas Adams is ever included in the lists of great children\u2019s writers.",
        "Maybe they don\u2019t ask enough children.",
        "But while the Great Man wrote with magnificent intellect and dazzling philosophy, with prose powerful enough to generate a million academic essays, there\u2019s surely the heart of a Great Big Kid inside these pages.",
        "And that\u2019s the greatest compliment! All kids invent stories.",
        "They imagine games of War, or Doctor Who and the Daleks, or the wonderful logic of Off Ground Touch.",
        "But then hormones and kissing and spots take over, and storytelling is put aside; or maybe people simply focus on telling the story of their own lives.",
        "But the best writers, I think, don\u2019t forget.",
        "They carry that childlike lunacy with them forever, its joy and its danger, and Hitchhiker\u2019s is packed with that unique energy, all barmy and bristling and bold.",
        "This book can be witty, iconoclastic, godless, savage, sweet, surreal, but above all, it dares to be silly.",
        "Fiercely, beautifully silly.",
        "No wonder it became a banner, a badge, a totem, for the Class of \u201979.",
        "Douglas Adams was writing for us.",
        "And a good book has a radioactive half life way beyond our childhoods.",
        "Just a few years ago, I was buying a house.",
        "The owner showed me round.",
        "I looked at the bookshelves, like you do.",
        "And there it was.",
        "The original paperback.",
        "The wet neon.",
        "I picked it out, and just smiled; the man smiled back.",
        "We didn\u2019t need to say anything, but it was still there, that connection between strangers, almost thirty years later.",
        "Something we once loved, and love now, in the shape of a book.",
        "Maybe eBooks are going to take over, one day, but not until those whizzkids in Silicon Valley invent a way to bend the corners, fold the spine, yellow the pages, add a coffee ring or two and allow the plastic tablet to fall open at a favourite page.",
        "So, for God\u2019s sake, when you\u2019ve finished this book, don\u2019t seal it away on a shelf.",
        "Put it in your pocket.",
        "Pass it round.",
        "Spread the word.",
        "Leave it on a bus! And complete the circle \u2013 go on, someone, please, read it out in a school assembly.",
        "Because they\u2019ll love it, those kids, I promise; they will find it makes so much sense.",
        "Douglas Adams is waiting for them.",
        "So hand over this lovely paperback, for the next thirty years.",
        "RUSSELL T DAVIES Writer and producer of Doctor Who and Torchwood Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral Arm of the Galaxy lies a small un regarded yellow sun.",
        "Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.",
        "This planet has \u2013 or rather had \u2013 a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.",
        "Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn\u2019t the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.",
        "And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.",
        "Many were increasingly of the opinion that they\u2019d all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place.",
        "And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.",
        "And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small caf\u00e9 in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place.",
        "This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.",
        "Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terrible, stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea was lost for ever.",
        "This is not her story.",
        "But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.",
        "It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy \u2013 not an Earth book, never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or even heard of by any Earthmen.",
        "Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.",
        "In fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor \u2013 of which no Earthman had ever heard either.",
        "Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one \u2013 more popular than The Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty three More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid\u2019s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God\u2019s Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway? In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.",
        "First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON\u2019T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.",
        "But the story of this terrible stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very simply.",
        "It begins with a house.",
        "1 The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.",
        "It stood on its own and looked out over a broad spread of West Country farmland.",
        "Not a remarkable house by any means \u2013 it was about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which more or less exactly failed to please the eye.",
        "The only person for whom the house was in any way special was Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one he lived in.",
        "He had lived in it for about three years, ever since he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and irritable.",
        "He was about thirty as well, tall, dark haired and never quite at ease with himself.",
        "The thing that used to worry him most was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was looking so worried about.",
        "He worked in local radio, which he always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than they probably thought.",
        "It was, too \u2013 most of his friends worked in advertising.",
        "On Wednesday night it had rained very heavily, the lane was wet and muddy, but the Thursday morning sun was bright and clear as it shone on Arthur Dent\u2019s house for what was to be that last time.",
        "It hadn\u2019t properly registered yet with Arthur that the council wanted to knock it down and build a bypass instead.",
        "At eight o\u2019clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn\u2019t feel very good.",
        "He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and stomped off to the bathroom to wash.",
        "Toothpaste on the brush \u2013 so.",
        "Scrub.",
        "Shaving mirror \u2013 pointing at the ceiling.",
        "He adjusted it.",
        "For a moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom window.",
        "Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent\u2019s bristles.",
        "He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen to find something pleasant to put in his mouth.",
        "Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee.",
        "Yawn.",
        "The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in search of something to connect with.",
        "The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.",
        "He stared at it.",
        "\u2018Yellow,\u2019 he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get dressed.",
        "Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water, and another.",
        "He began to suspect that he was hung over.",
        "Why was he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed that he must have been.",
        "He caught a glint in the shaving mirror.",
        "\u2018Yellow,\u2019 he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.",
        "He stood and thought.",
        "The pub, he thought.",
        "Oh dear, the pub.",
        "He vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed important.",
        "He\u2019d been telling people about it, telling people about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people\u2019s faces.",
        "Something about a new bypass he\u2019d just found out about.",
        "It had been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known about it.",
        "Ridiculous.",
        "He took a swig of water.",
        "It would sort itself out, he\u2019d decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on.",
        "It would sort itself out.",
        "God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though.",
        "He looked at himself in the wardrobe mirror.",
        "He stuck out his tongue.",
        "\u2018Yellow,\u2019 he thought.",
        "The word yellow wandered through his mind in search of something to connect with.",
        "Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.",
        "Mr L.",
        "Prosser was, as they say, only human.",
        "In other words he was a carbon based bipedal life form descended from an ape.",
        "More specifically he was forty, fat and shabby, and worked for the local council.",
        "Curiously enough, though he didn\u2019t know it, he was also a direct male line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only vestiges left in Mr L.",
        "Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little fur hats.",
        "He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous worried man.",
        "Today he was particularly nervous and worried because something had gone seriously wrong with his job \u2013 which was to see that Arthur Dent\u2019s house got cleared out of the way before the day was out.",
        "\u2018Come off it, Mr Dent,\u2019 he said, \u2018you can\u2019t win, you know.",
        "You can\u2019t lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely.\u2019 He tried to make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn\u2019t do it.",
        "Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m game,\u2019 he said, \u2018we\u2019ll see who rusts first.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to accept it,\u2019 said Mr Prosser, gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head, \u2018this bypass has got to be built and it\u2019s going to be built!\u2019 \u2018First I\u2019ve heard of it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018why\u2019s it got to be built?\u2019 Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and put it away again.",
        "\u2018What do you mean, why\u2019s it got to be built?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a bypass.",
        "You\u2019ve got to build bypasses.\u2019 Bypasses are devices which allow some people to dash from point A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to point A very fast.",
        "People living at point C, being a point directly in between, are often given to wonder what\u2019s so great about point A that so many people from point B are so keen to get there, and what\u2019s so great about point B that so many people from point A are so keen to get there.",
        "They often wish that people would just once and for all work out where the hell they want to be.",
        "Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D.",
        "Point D wasn\u2019t anywhere in particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from points A, B and C.",
        "He would have a nice little cottage at point D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D.",
        "His wife of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes.",
        "He didn\u2019t know why \u2013 he just liked axes.",
        "He flushed hotly under the derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.",
        "He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally uncomfortable on each.",
        "Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn\u2019t him.",
        "Mr Prosser said, \u2018You were quite entitled to make any suggestions or protests at the appropriate time, you know.\u2019 \u2018Appropriate time?\u2019 hooted Arthur.",
        "\u2018Appropriate time? The first I knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday.",
        "I asked him if he\u2019d come to clean the windows and he said no he\u2019d come to demolish the house.",
        "He didn\u2019t tell me straight away, of course.",
        "Oh no.",
        "First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me a fiver.",
        "Then he told me.\u2019 \u2018But, Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning office for the last nine months.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see them, yesterday afternoon.",
        "You hadn\u2019t exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean like actually telling anybody or anything.\u2019 \u2018But the plans were on display...\u2019 \u2018On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the display department.\u2019 \u2018With a torch.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well the lights had probably gone.\u2019 \u2018So had the stairs.\u2019 \u2018But look, you found the notice, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018yes I did.",
        "It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard.\u2019 A cloud passed overhead.",
        "It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud.",
        "It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent\u2019s house.",
        "Mr Prosser frowned at it.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a particularly nice house,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I happen to like it.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll like the bypass.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up,\u2019 said Arthur Dent.",
        "\u2018Shut up and go away, and take your bloody bypass with you.",
        "You haven\u2019t got a leg to stand on and you know it.\u2019 Mr Prosser\u2019s mouth opened and closed a couple of times whilst his mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly attractive visions of Arthur Dent\u2019s house being consumed with fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.",
        "Mr Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made him feel very nervous.",
        "He stuttered for a moment and then pulled himself together.",
        "\u2018Mr Dent,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Hello? Yes?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Some factual information for you.",
        "Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?\u2019 \u2018How much?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018None at all,\u2019 said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen all shouting at him.",
        "By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much suspicion the ape descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he usually claimed.",
        "Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.",
        "This friend of his had first arrived on the planet Earth some fifteen Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself into Earth society \u2013 with, it must be said, some success.",
        "For instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out of work actor, which was plausible enough.",
        "He had made one careless blunder, though, because he had skimped a bit on his preparatory research.",
        "The information he had gathered had led him to choose the name \u2018Ford Prefect\u2019 as being nicely inconspicuous.",
        "He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not conspicuously handsome.",
        "His hair was wiry and gingerish and brushed backwards from the temples.",
        "His skin seemed to be pulled backwards from the nose.",
        "There was something very slightly odd about him, but it was difficult to say what it was.",
        "Perhaps it was that his eyes didn\u2019t seem to blink often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to water on his behalf.",
        "Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was about to go for their neck.",
        "He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an eccentric, but a harmless one \u2013 an unruly boozer with some oddish habits.",
        "For instance he would often gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any astrophysicists he could find till he got thrown out.",
        "Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what he was doing.",
        "Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax and grin.",
        "\u2018Oh, just looking for flying saucers,\u2019 he would joke and everyone would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was looking for.",
        "\u2018Green ones!\u2019 he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an enormous round of drinks.",
        "Evenings like this usually ended badly.",
        "Ford would get out of his skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying saucers didn\u2019t matter that much really.",
        "Thereafter, staggering semi paralytic down the night streets, he would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to Betelgeuse.",
        "The policemen would usually say something like, \u2018Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you went off home, sir?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m trying to, baby, I\u2019m trying to,\u2019 is what Ford invariably replied on these occasions.",
        "In fact what he was really looking for when he stared distractedly into the sky was any kind of flying saucer at all.",
        "The reason he said green was that green was the traditional space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.",
        "Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindbogglingly dull as the Earth.",
        "Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them.",
        "He knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairian dollars a day.",
        "In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the environs of Arthur\u2019s house had settled into a steady routine.",
        "It was Arthur\u2019s accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother, or a good book; it was Mr Prosser\u2019s accepted role to tackle Arthur with the occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, or the March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers\u2019 accepted role to sit around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations to see how they could turn the situation to their financial advantage.",
        "The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.",
        "The sun was beginning to dry out the mud that Arthur lay in.",
        "A shadow moved across him again.",
        "\u2018Hello, Arthur,\u2019 said the shadow.",
        "Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see Ford Prefect standing above him.",

        "\u2018Well, I\u2019ve just got all these bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they\u2019ll knock my house down if I don\u2019t, but other than that...",
        "well, no not especially, why?\u2019 They don\u2019t have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often failed to notice it unless he was concentrating.",
        "He said, \u2018Good, is there anywhere we can talk?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur Dent.",
        "For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car.",
        "Then suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve got to talk,\u2019 he said urgently.",

        "\u2018Nothing.",
        "Nothing\u2019s the matter.",

        "I\u2019ve got to tell you now, and I\u2019ve got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse and Groom.\u2019 \u2018But why?\u2019 \u2018Because you\u2019re going to need a very stiff drink.\u2019 Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find his will beginning to weaken.",
        "He didn\u2019t realize that this was because of an old drinking game that Ford had learned to play in the hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the star system of Orion Beta.",
        "The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling, and was played like this: Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in front of each of them.",
        "Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song \u2018Oh don\u2019t give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit / No, don\u2019t you give me none more of that Old Janx Spirit / For my head will fly, my tongue will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die / Won\u2019t you pour me one more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit\u2019).",
        "Each of the two contestants would then concentrate his will on the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass of his opponent \u2013 who would then have to drink it.",
        "The bottle would then be refilled.",
        "The game would be played again.",
        "And again.",
        "Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because one of the effects of Janx Spirit is to depress telepsychic power.",
        "As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually obscenely biological.",
        "Ford Prefect usually played to lose.",
        "Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did want to go to the Horse and Groom after all.",
        "\u2018But what about my house...?\u2019 he asked plaintively.",
        "Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought struck him.",

        "\u2018And can we also assume,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that he\u2019s going to be staying here all day?\u2019 \u2018So?\u2019 \u2018So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing nothing?\u2019 \u2018Could be, could be...\u2019 \u2018Well, if you\u2019re resigned to doing that anyway, you don\u2019t actually need him to lie here all the time, do you?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018You don\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford patiently, \u2018actually need him here.\u2019 Mr Prosser thought about this.",
        "\u2018Well no, not as such...\u2019 he said, \u2018not exactly need...\u2019 Mr Prosser was worried.",
        "He thought that one of them wasn\u2019t making a lot of sense.",
        "Ford said, \u2018So if you would just like to take it as read that he\u2019s actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub for half an hour.",
        "How does that sound?\u2019 Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.",
        "\u2018That sounds perfectly reasonable...\u2019 he said in a reassuring tone of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure.",
        "\u2018And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we can always cover for you in return.\u2019 \u2018Thank you very much,\u2019 said Mr Prosser, who no longer knew how to play this at all, \u2018thank you very much, yes, that\u2019s very kind...\u2019 He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once, failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round the top of his head.",
        "He could only assume that he had just won.",
        "\u2018So,\u2019 continued Ford Prefect, \u2018if you would just like to come over here and lie down...\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Mr Prosser.",
        "\u2018Ah, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018perhaps I hadn\u2019t made myself fully clear.",
        "Somebody\u2019s got to lie in front of the bulldozers, haven\u2019t they? Or there won\u2019t be anything to stop them driving into Mr Dent\u2019s house, will there?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Mr Prosser again.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s very simple,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018my client, Mr Dent, says that he will stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you come and take over from him.\u2019 \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 said Arthur, but Ford nudged him with his shoe to be quiet.",
        "\u2018You want me,\u2019 said Prosser, spelling out his new thought to himself, \u2018to come and lie there...\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018In front of the bulldozer?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Instead of Mr Dent.\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018In the mud.\u2019 \u2018In, as you say, the mud.\u2019 As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it.",
        "He sighed.",
        "\u2018In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the pub?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018that\u2019s it exactly.\u2019 Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped.",
        "\u2018Promise?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Promise,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He turned to Arthur.",

        "The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed into his shoes.",

        "\u2018And no sneaky knocking Mr Dent\u2019s house down whilst he\u2019s away, all right?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018The mere thought,\u2019 growled Mr Prosser, \u2018hadn\u2019t even begun to speculate,\u2019 he continued, settling himself back, \u2018about the merest possibility of crossing my mind.\u2019 He saw the bulldozer drivers\u2019 union representative approaching and let his head sink back and closed his eyes.",
        "He was trying to marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute a mental health hazard himself.",
        "He was far from certain about this \u2013 his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and the stench of blood.",
        "This always happened when he felt miserable or put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to himself.",
        "In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly and whimpered.",
        "He began to feel little pricks of water behind his eyelids.",

        "\u2018Come on, I need a drink.\u2019 2 Here\u2019s what The Encyclopaedia Galactica has to say about alcohol.",
        "It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect on certain carbon based life forms.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol.",
        "It says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.",

        "A man waved at him to stop smiling at them and mind his own business.",
        "\u2018This must be Thursday,\u2019 said Arthur to himself, sinking low over his beer, \u2018I never could get the hang of Thursdays.\u2019 3 On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet; several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky slablike somethings, huge as office blocks, silent as birds.",
        "They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.",
        "The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment.",
        "The huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomers and Jodrell Bank looked straight through them \u2013 which was a pity because it was exactly the sort of thing they\u2019d been looking for all these years.",
        "The only place they registered at all was on a small black device called a Sub Etha Sens O Matic which winked away quietly to itself.",
        "It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which Ford Prefect habitually wore slung around his neck.",
        "The contents of Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were quite interesting, in fact, and would have made any earth physicist\u2019s eyes pop out of his head, which is why he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog eared scripts for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.",
        "Besides the Sub Etha Sens O Matic and the scripts he had an Electronic Thumb \u2013 a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.",
        "This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square on which any one of a million \u2018pages\u2019 could be summoned at a moment\u2019s notice.",
        "It looked insanely complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic cover it fitted into had the words DON\u2019T PANIC printed on it in large friendly letters.",
        "The other reason was that this device was in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor \u2013 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around in.",
        "Beneath that in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel were a few biros, a notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.",
        "A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.",
        "Partly it has great practical value \u2013 you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand to hand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindbogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can\u2019t see it, it can\u2019t see you \u2013 daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.",
        "More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.",
        "For some reason, if a strag (strag: non hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit, etc., etc.",
        "Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have \u2018lost\u2019.",
        "What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still know where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.",
        "Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in \u2018Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There\u2019s a frood who really knows where his towel is.\u2019 (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.) Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect\u2019s satchel, the Sub Etha Sens O Matic began to wink more quickly.",
        "Miles above the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan out.",
        "At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice relaxing cup of tea.",
        "\u2018You got a towel with you?\u2019 said Ford suddenly to Arthur.",
        "Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.",
        "\u2018Why? What, no...",
        "should I have?\u2019 He had given up being surprised, there didn\u2019t seem to be any point any longer.",
        "Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.",
        "\u2018Drink up,\u2019 he urged.",
        "At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.",
        "Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 he yelped.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018they haven\u2019t started yet.\u2019 \u2018Thank God for that,\u2019 said Arthur and relaxed.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s probably just your house being knocked down,\u2019 said Ford, downing his last pint.",
        "\u2018What?\u2019 shouted Arthur.",
        "Suddenly Ford\u2019s spell was broken.",
        "Arthur looked wildly around him and ran to the window.",
        "\u2018My God, they are! They\u2019re knocking my house down.",
        "What the hell am I doing in the pub, Ford?\u2019 \u2018It hardly makes any difference at this stage,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018let them have their fun.\u2019 \u2018Fun?\u2019 yelped Arthur.",
        "\u2018Fun!\u2019 He quickly checked out of the window again that they were talking about the same thing.",
        "\u2018Damn their fun!\u2019 he shouted and ran out of the pub furiously waving a nearly empty beer glass.",
        "He made no friends at all in the pub that lunchtime.",
        "\u2018Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!\u2019 bawled Arthur.",
        "\u2018You half crazed Visigoths, stop, will you!\u2019 Ford would have to go after him.",
        "Turning quickly to the barman he asked for four packets of peanuts.",
        "\u2018There you are, sir,\u2019 said the barman, slapping the packets on the bar, \u2018twenty eight pence if you\u2019d be so kind.\u2019 Ford was very kind \u2013 he gave the barman another five pound note and told him to keep the change.",
        "The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford.",
        "He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn\u2019t understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before.",
        "In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal.",
        "This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth.",
        "On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn\u2019t very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed.",
        "Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse.",
        "The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking, incomprehensible sense of distance.",
        "He didn\u2019t know what it meant, but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost awe.",
        "\u2018Are you serious, sir?\u2019 he said in a small whisper which had the effect of silencing the pub.",
        "\u2018You think the world\u2019s going to end?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018But, this afternoon?\u2019 Ford had recovered himself.",
        "He was at his flippest.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said gaily, \u2018in less than two minutes, I would estimate.\u2019 The barman couldn\u2019t believe this conversation he was having, but he couldn\u2019t believe the sensation he had just had either.",
        "\u2018Isn\u2019t there anything we can do about it, then?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018No, nothing,\u2019 said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pocket.",
        "Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how stupid everyone had become.",
        "The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now.",
        "His eyes weaved their way up to Ford.",
        "\u2018I thought,\u2019 he said \u2018that if the world was going to end we were meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something.\u2019 \u2018If you like, yes,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s what they told us in the army,\u2019 said the man, and his eyes began the long trek back towards his whisky.",
        "\u2018Will that help?\u2019 asked the barman.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 said Ford and gave him a friendly smile.",
        "\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go.\u2019 With a wave, he left.",
        "The pub was silent for a moment longer and then, embarrassingly enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again.",
        "The girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour, and it would probably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.",
        "However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice it.",
        "The barman checked his throat.",
        "He heard himself say: \u2018Last orders, please.\u2019 The huge yellow machines began to sink downwards and to move faster.",
        "Ford knew they were there.",
        "This wasn\u2019t the way he had wanted it.",
        "Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house.",
        "He didn\u2019t notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn\u2019t notice the wind, he didn\u2019t notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.",
        "He didn\u2019t notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling over the rubble that had been his home.",
        "\u2018You barbarians!\u2019 he yelled.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll sue the council for every penny it\u2019s got! I\u2019ll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And whipped! And boiled...",
        "until...",
        "until...",
        "until you\u2019ve had enough.\u2019 Ford was running after him very fast.",
        "Very very fast.",
        "\u2018And then I will do it again!\u2019 yelled Arthur.",
        "\u2018And when I\u2019ve finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on them!\u2019 Arthur didn\u2019t notice that the men were running from the bulldozers; he didn\u2019t notice that Mr Prosser was staring hectically into the sky.",
        "What Mr Prosser had noticed was that huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds.",
        "Impossibly huge yellow somethings.",
        "\u2018And I will carry on jumping on them,\u2019 yelled Arthur, still running, \u2018until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even more unpleasant to do, and then...\u2019 Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his back.",
        "At last he noticed that something was going on.",
        "His finger shot upwards.",
        "\u2018What the hell\u2019s that?\u2019 he shrieked.",
        "Whatever it was raced across the sky in its monstrous yellowness, tore the sky apart with a mind buggering noise and leapt off into the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang that drove your ears six feet into your skull.",
        "Another one followed and did exactly the same thing only louder.",
        "It\u2019s difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of the planet were doing now, because they didn\u2019t really know what they were doing themselves.",
        "None of it made a lot of sense \u2013 running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly at the noise.",
        "All around the world city streets exploded with people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.",
        "Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears.",
        "He knew exactly what was happening and had known ever since his Sub Etha Sens O Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillow and woken him with a start.",
        "It was what he had waited for all these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern, sitting alone in his small dark room, a coldness had gripped him and squeezed his heart.",
        "Of all the races in all the Galaxy who could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought, didn\u2019t it just have to be the Vogons.",
        "Still he knew what he had to do.",
        "As the Vogon craft screamed through the air high above him he opened his satchel.",
        "He threw away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he threw away a copy of Godspell: he wouldn\u2019t need them where he was going.",
        "Everything was ready, everything was prepared.",
        "He knew where his towel was.",
        "A sudden silence hit the Earth.",
        "If anything it was worse than the noise.",
        "For a while nothing happened.",
        "The great ships hung motionless in the sky, over every nation on Earth.",
        "Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a blasphemy against nature.",
        "Many people went straight into shock as their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at.",
        "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don\u2019t.",
        "And still nothing happened.",
        "Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of open ambient sound.",
        "Every hi fi set in the world, every radio, every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every tweeter, every mid range driver in the world quietly turned itself on.",
        "Every tin can, every dustbin, every window, every car, every wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an acoustically perfect sounding board.",
        "Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address system ever built.",
        "But there was no concert, no music, no fanfare, just a simple message.",
        "\u2018People of Earth, your attention please,\u2019 a voice said, and it was wonderful.",
        "Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.",
        "\u2018This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council,\u2019 the voice continued.",
        "\u2018As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition.",
        "The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes.",
        "Thank you.\u2019 The PA died away.",
        "Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.",
        "The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they were iron filings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving beneath them.",
        "Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but there was nowhere to flee to.",
        "Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again.",
        "It said: \u2018There\u2019s no point in acting all surprised about it.",
        "All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you\u2019ve had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it\u2019s far too late to start making a fuss about it now.\u2019 The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the land.",
        "The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power.",
        "On the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black square.",
        "By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcast a message back to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet.",
        "Nobody ever heard what they said, they only heard the reply.",
        "The PA slammed back into life again.",
        "The voice was annoyed.",
        "It said: \u2018What do you mean you\u2019ve never been to Alpha Centauri? For Heavens\u2019s sake, mankind, it\u2019s only four light years away, you know.",
        "I\u2019m sorry, but if you can\u2019t be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that\u2019s your own lookout.\u2019 \u2018Energize the demolition beams.\u2019 Light poured out of the hatchways.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said the voice on the PA, \u2018apathetic bloody planet, I\u2019ve no sympathy at all.\u2019 It cut off.",
        "There was a terrible ghastly silence.",
        "There was a terrible ghastly noise.",
        "There was a terrible ghastly silence.",
        "The Vogon Constructor Fleet coasted away into the inky starry void.",
        "4 Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing in the Damogran sun.",
        "Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost totally unheard of.",
        "Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.",
        "The boat sped on across the water.",
        "It would be some time before it reached its destination because Damogran is such an inconveniently arranged planet.",
        "It consists of nothing but middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but annoyingly wide stretches of ocean.",
        "The boat sped on.",
        "Because of this topographical awkwardness Damogran has always remained a deserted planet.",
        "This is why the Imperial Galactic Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold project was so secret.",
        "The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful size on the whole planet.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely meaningless coincidence \u2013 in Galacticspeke, easter means small flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by another meaningless coincidence was called France.",
        "One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole string of pretty meaningless coincidences.",
        "But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod Beeblebrox.",
        "It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent shock waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy \u2013 Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas.",
        "Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.",
        "President? No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.",
        "Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was ideal presidency fodder.* What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was doing it.",
        "He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.",
        "Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what Zaphod had been up to.",
        "Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s Presidency was all about.",
        "Today was also his two hundredth birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence.",
        "As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was going to be.",
        "He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily along the seat back.",
        "He steered with an extra arm he\u2019d recently had fitted just beneath his right one to help improve his ski boxing.",
        "\u2018Hey,\u2019 he cooed to himself, \u2018you\u2019re a real cool boy, you.\u2019 But his nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.",
        "The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles across the middle, sandy and crescent shaped.",
        "In fact it seemed to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay.",
        "This impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs.",
        "From the top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the opposite shore.",
        "On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.",
        "It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who had built the Heart of Gold \u2013 mostly humanoid, but here and there were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green sylph like maximegalaticians, an octopodic physucturalist or two and a Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super intelligent shade of the colour blue).",
        "All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi coloured ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion.",
        "There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of them.",
        "Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his neck.",
        "(An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference to them if they\u2019d known exactly how much power the President of the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all.",
        "Only six people in the Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to wield power but to attract attention away from it.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.",
        "The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seamanship, as the Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay.",
        "It flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide skidding turns.",
        "In fact it didn\u2019t need to touch the water at all, because it was supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms \u2013 but just for effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered into the water.",
        "They slashed sheets of water hissing into the air, carved deep gashes in the sea which swayed crazily and sank back foaming in the boat\u2019s wake as it careered across the bay.",
        "Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.",
        "He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly on the rocking waves.",
        "Within seconds he ran out on to the deck and waved and grinned at over three billion people.",
        "The three billion people weren\u2019t actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the eyes of a small robot tri D camera which hovered obsequiously in the air nearby.",
        "The antics of the President always made amazingly popular tri D: that\u2019s what they were for.",
        "He grinned again.",
        "Three billion and six people didn\u2019t know it, but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.",
        "The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of his two heads and he waved again.",
        "He was roughly humanoid in appearance except for the extra head and third arm.",
        "His tousled fair hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins were almost always unshaven.",
        "A twenty foot high transparent globe floated next to his boat, rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun.",
        "Inside it floated a wide semi circular sofa upholstered in glorious red leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock.",
        "Again, all done for effect as much as anything.",
        "Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the sofa.",
        "He spread his two arms along the back and with the third brushed some dust off his knee.",
        "His heads looked about, smiling; he put his feet up.",
        "At any moment, he thought, he might scream.",
        "Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted.",
        "The bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water spout.",
        "Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff.",
        "Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it, crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.",
        "Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.",
        "A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly beautiful one.",
        "At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and riddled to a halt.",
        "To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.",
        "The President of the Galaxy had arrived.",
        "He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hand in greeting.",
        "\u2018Hi,\u2019 he said.",
        "A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a copy of his prepared speech into his hands.",
        "Pages three to seven of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay.",
        "Pages one and two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of nest which the eagle had invented.",
        "It was constructed largely of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched baby eagle to break out of it.",
        "The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no truck with it.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider.",
        "\u2018Hi,\u2019 he said again.",
        "Everyone beamed at him, or at least, nearly everyone.",
        "He singled out Trillian from the crowd.",
        "Trillian was a girl that Zaphod had picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun, incognito.",
        "She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of black hair, a full mouth, an odd little knob of a nose and ridiculously brown eyes.",
        "With her red head scarf knotted in that particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked vaguely Arabic.",
        "Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab, of course.",
        "The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years from Damogran.",
        "Trillian wasn\u2019t anybody in particular, or so Zaphod claimed.",
        "She just went around with him rather a lot and told him what she thought of him.",
        "\u2018Hi, honey,\u2019 he said to her.",
        "She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away.",
        "Then she looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly \u2013 but by this time he was looking at something else.",
        "\u2018Hi,\u2019 he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get on with the quotes.",
        "He grinned at them particularly because he knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a quote.",
        "The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them.",
        "One of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the switch on the remote control device in his pocket.",
        "Away in front of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked down the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the ground.",
        "Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it was going to do that because they\u2019d built it that way.",
        "Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white and mindbogglingly beautiful.",
        "At the heart of it, unseen, lay a small gold box which carried within it the most brain wrenching device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had been named \u2013 the Heart of Gold.",
        "\u2018Wow,\u2019 said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold.",
        "There wasn\u2019t much else he could say.",
        "He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.",
        "\u2018Wow.\u2019 The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly.",
        "He winked at Trillian, who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes at him.",
        "She knew what he was about to say and thought him a terrible show off.",
        "\u2018That is really amazing,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018That really is truly amazing.",
        "That is so amazingly amazing I think I\u2019d like to steal it.\u2019 A marvellous presidential quote, absolutely true to form.",
        "The crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched buttons on their Sub Etha News Matics and the President grinned.",
        "As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the small Paralyso Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.",
        "Finally he could bear it no more.",
        "He lifted his heads up to the sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen beaming smiles.",
        "5 Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other Vogons.",
        "His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy forehead.",
        "His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well, and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.",
        "Not that he ever went swimming, of course.",
        "His busy schedule would not allow it.",
        "He was the way he was because billions of years ago when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the planet\u2019s virgin shores...",
        "when the first rays of the bright young Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the forces of evolution had simply given up on them there and then, had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and unfortunate mistake.",
        "They never evolved again: they should never have survived.",
        "The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick willed slug brained stubbornness of these creatures.",
        "Evolution? they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused to do for them they simply did without until such time as they were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with surgery.",
        "Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vog sphere had been working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder.",
        "They brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall aspiring trees of breathtaking slenderness and colour which the Vogons cut down and burnt the crab meat with; elegant gazelle like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons would catch and sit on.",
        "They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them anyway.",
        "Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar travel.",
        "Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the Galaxy, and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the Galactic Civil Service.",
        "They have attempted to acquire learning, they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his primitive forebears.",
        "Every year they import twenty seven thousand scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with iron mallets.",
        "Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was thoroughly vile.",
        "Also, he did not like hitchhikers.",
        "Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz\u2019s flagship, a small match flared nervously.",
        "The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew all about them and was right to be nervous.",
        "His name was Ford Prefect.* He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering flame, but all was quiet.",
        "He breathed a silent thank you to the Dentrassis.",
        "The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they kept themselves very much to themselves.",
        "This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves.",
        "The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to see was an annoyed Vogon.",
        "It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide.",
        "He heard a slight groan.",
        "By the light of the match he saw a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor.",
        "Quickly he shook the match out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and took it out.",
        "He ripped it open and shook it.",
        "He crouched on the floor.",
        "The shape moved again.",
        "Ford Prefect said: \u2018I bought some peanuts.\u2019 Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.",
        "\u2018Here, have some,\u2019 urged Ford, shaking the packet again, \u2018if you\u2019ve never been through a matter transference beam before you\u2019ve probably lost some salt and protein.",
        "The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit.\u2019 \u2018Whhhrrrr...\u2019 said Arthur Dent.",
        "He opened his eyes.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s dark,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford Prefect.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s dark.\u2019 \u2018No light,\u2019 said Arthur Dent.",
        "\u2018Dark, no light.\u2019 One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in It\u2019s a nice day, or You\u2019re very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty foot well, are you all right? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour.",
        "If human beings don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up.",
        "After a few months\u2019 consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one.",
        "If they don\u2019t keep exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.",
        "After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried about the terrible number of things they didn\u2019t know about.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he agreed with Arthur, \u2018no light.\u2019 He helped Arthur to some peanuts.",
        "\u2018How do you feel?\u2019 he asked him.",
        "\u2018Like a military academy,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018bits of me keep on passing out.\u2019 Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness.",
        "\u2018If I asked you where the hell we were,\u2019 said Arthur weakly, \u2018would I regret it?\u2019 Ford stood up.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re safe,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Oh good,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re in a small galley cabin,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018in one of the spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018this is obviously some strange usage of the word safe that I wasn\u2019t previously aware of.\u2019 Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch.",
        "Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again.",
        "Arthur struggled to his feet and hugged himself apprehensively.",
        "Hideous alien shapes seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.",
        "\u2018How did we get here?\u2019 he asked, shivering slightly.",
        "\u2018We hitched a lift,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Excuse me?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Are you trying to tell me that we just stuck out our thumbs and some green bugeyed monster stuck his head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in, I can take you as far as the Basingstoke roundabout?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the Thumb\u2019s an electronic sub etha signalling device, the roundabout\u2019s at Barnard\u2019s Star six light years away, but otherwise, that\u2019s more or less right.\u2019 \u2018And the bug eyed monster?\u2019 \u2018Is green, yes.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018when can I go home?\u2019 \u2018You can\u2019t,\u2019 said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.",
        "\u2018Shade your eyes...\u2019 he said, and turned it on.",
        "Even Ford was surprised.",
        "\u2018Good grief,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018is this really the interior of a flying saucer?\u2019 Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the control bridge.",
        "He always felt vaguely irritable after demolishing populated planets.",
        "He wished that someone would come and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them and feel better.",
        "He flopped as heavily as he could on to his control seat in the hope that it would break and give him something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a complaining sort of creak.",
        "\u2018Go away!\u2019 he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the bridge at that moment.",
        "The guard vanished immediately, feeling rather relieved.",
        "He was glad it wouldn\u2019t now be him who delivered the report they\u2019d just received.",
        "The report was an official release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express routes unnecessary.",
        "Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn\u2019t shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the Dentrassis prepared his meals.",
        "A meal would be most welcome.",
        "A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch tray.",
        "It was grinning like a maniac.",
        "Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted.",
        "He knew that when a Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry indeed about.",
        "Ford and Arthur stared around them.",
        "\u2018Well, what do you think?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a bit squalid, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Ford frowned at the grubby mattresses, unwashed cups and unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the cramped cabin.",
        "\u2018Well, this is a working ship, you see,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018These are the Dentrassi sleeping quarters.\u2019 \u2018I thought you said they were called Vogons or something.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are the cooks, they let us on board.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m confused,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Here, have a look at this,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He sat down on one of the mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel.",
        "Arthur prodded the mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in the swamps of Sqornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and dried before being put to service.",
        "Very few have ever come to life again.",
        "Ford handed the book to Arthur.",
        "\u2018What is it?\u2019 asked Arthur.",
        "\u2018The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "It\u2019s a sort of electronic book.",
        "It tells you everything you need to know about anything.",
        "That\u2019s its job.\u2019 Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands.",
        "\u2018I like the cover,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t Panic.",
        "It\u2019s the first helpful or intelligible thing anybody\u2019s said to me all day.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll show you how it works,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He snatched it from Arthur who was still holding it as if it was a two week dead lark and pulled it out of its cover.",
        "\u2018You press this button here, you see, and the screen lights up giving you the index.\u2019 A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began to flicker across the surface.",
        "\u2018You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so.\u2019 His fingers tapped some more keys.",
        "\u2018And there we are.\u2019 The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen.",
        "Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it.",
        "At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice.",
        "This is what the book said.",
        "\u2018Vogon Constructor Fleets.",
        "Here is what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it.",
        "They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy \u2013 not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous.",
        "They wouldn\u2019t even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters.",
        "\u2018The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.",
        "\u2018On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you.\u2019 Arthur blinked at it.",
        "\u2018What a strange book.",
        "How did we get a lift, then?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the point, it\u2019s out of date now,\u2019 said Ford, sliding the book back into its cover.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m doing the field research for the new revised edition, and one of the things I\u2019ll have to do is include a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks, which gives us a rather useful little loophole.\u2019 A pained expression crossed Arthur\u2019s face.",
        "\u2018But who are the Dentrassi?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Great guys,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018They\u2019re the best cooks and the best drinks mixers and they don\u2019t give a wet slap about anything else.",
        "And they\u2019ll always help hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons.",
        "Which is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you\u2019re an impoverished hitchhiker trying to see the marvels of the Universe for less than thirty Altairian dollars a day.",
        "And that\u2019s my job.",
        "Fun, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Arthur looked lost.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s amazing,\u2019 he said and frowned at one of the other mattresses.",
        "\u2018Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I intended,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018I came for a week and got stuck for fifteen years.\u2019 \u2018But how did you get there in the first place, then?\u2019 \u2018Easy, I got a lift with a teaser.\u2019 \u2018A teaser?\u2019 \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Er, what is...\u2019 \u2018A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do.",
        "They cruise around looking for planets which haven\u2019t made interstellar contact yet and buzz them.\u2019 \u2018Buzz them?\u2019 Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making life difficult for him.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018they buzz them.",
        "They find some isolated spot with very few people around, then land right by some poor unsuspecting soul whom no one\u2019s ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennae on their head and making beep beep noises.",
        "Rather childish really.\u2019 Ford leant back on the mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly pleased with himself.",
        "\u2018Ford,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018I don\u2019t know if this sounds like a silly question, but what am I doing here?\u2019 \u2018Well, you know that,\u2019 said Ford.",

        "\u2018Yes.",
        "It just boiled away into space.\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019m a bit upset about that.\u2019 Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his mind.",
        "\u2018Yes, I can understand that,\u2019 he said at last.",

        "Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a small yellow fish wriggling around in it.",
        "Arthur blinked at him.",
        "He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could grasp hold of.",
        "He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi underwear, the piles of Sqornshellous mattresses and the man from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of cornflakes.",

        "Gasping with horror he scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned goggle eyed with wonder.",
        "He was experiencing the aural equivalent of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick.",

Either die in the vacuum of space, or...\u2019 he paused for melodramatic effect, \u2018tell me how good you thought my poem was!\u2019 He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat shaped seat and watched them.",

        "Let go of me, you brute!\u2019 The Vogon guard dragged them on.",

        "It\u2019s now just after four in the afternoon and I\u2019m already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\u2019 He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018just stop panicking!\u2019 \u2018Who said anything about panicking?\u2019 snapped Arthur.",

        "\u2018Resistance is useless!\u2019 \u2018Oh, give it a rest,\u2019 said Ford.",

        "\u2018What do you mean?\u2019 \u2018What I mean,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018is does it give you a full satisfying life? Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships...\u2019 The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows almost rolled over each other.",
        "His mouth slacked.",
        "Finally he said, \u2018Well, the hours are good...\u2019 \u2018They\u2019d have to be,\u2019 agreed Ford.",
        "Arthur twisted his head round to look at Ford.",

        "\u2018Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018So the hours are pretty good, then?\u2019 he resumed.",
        "The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around in the murky depths.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 he said, \u2018but now you come to mention it, most of the actual minutes are pretty lousy.",
        "Except...\u2019 he thought again, which required looking at the ceiling \u2013 \u2018except some of the shouting I quite like.\u2019 He filled his lungs and bellowed, \u2018Resistance is\u2014\u2019 \u2018Sure, yes,\u2019 interrupted Ford hurriedly, \u2018you\u2019re good at that, I can tell.",
        "But if it\u2019s mostly lousy,\u2019 he said, slowly giving the words time to reach their mark, \u2018then why do you do it? What is it? The girls? The leather? The machismo? Or do you just find that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents an interesting challenge?\u2019 Arthur looked backwards and forwards between them in bafflement.",
        "\u2018Er...\u2019 said the guard, \u2018er...",
        "er...",
        "I dunno.",

        "Apart from the unpleasant business with his home planet the Vogon guard had half throttled him already and he didn\u2019t like the sound of being thrown into space very much.",
        "\u2018Try and understand his problem,\u2019 insisted Ford.",
        "\u2018Here he is, poor lad, his entire life\u2019s work is stamping around, throwing people off spaceships...\u2019 \u2018And shouting,\u2019 added the guard.",
        "\u2018And shouting, sure,\u2019 said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped round his neck in friendly condescension, \u2018...",
        "and he doesn\u2019t even know why he\u2019s doing it!\u2019 Arthur agreed this was very sad.",
        "He did this with a small feeble gesture, because he was too asphyxiated to speak.",
        "Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.",
        "\u2018Well.",
        "Now you put it like that, I suppose...\u2019 \u2018Good lad,\u2019 encouraged Ford.",
        "\u2018But all right,\u2019 went on the rumblings, \u2018so what\u2019s the alternative?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Ford, brightly but slowly, \u2018stop doing it of course! Tell them,\u2019 he went on, \u2018you\u2019re not going to do it any more.\u2019 He felt he ought to add something to that, but for the moment the guard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much.",
        "\u2018Eerrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\u2019 said the guard, \u2018erm, well, that doesn\u2019t sound that great to me.\u2019 Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away.",
        "\u2018Now wait a minute,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s just the start, you see, there\u2019s more to it than that, you see...\u2019 But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock.",
        "He was obviously quite touched.",
        "\u2018No, I think if it\u2019s all the same to you,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019d better get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with some other bits of shouting I\u2019ve got to do.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t all the same to Ford Prefect at all.",
        "\u2018Come on now...",

        "\u2018Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnn...\u2019 said Arthur without any clear inflection.",
        "\u2018But hang on,\u2019 pursued Ford, \u2018there\u2019s music and art and things to tell you about yet! Arrggghhh!\u2019 \u2018Resistance is useless,\u2019 bellowed the guard, and then added, \u2018You see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior Shouting Officer, and there aren\u2019t usually many vacancies for non shouting and non pushing people about officers, so I think I\u2019d better stick to what I know.\u2019 They had now reached the airlock \u2013 a large circular steel hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin of the craft.",
        "The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung smoothly open.",
        "\u2018But thanks for taking an interest,\u2019 said the Vogon guard.",
        "\u2018Bye now.\u2019 He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the small chamber within.",
        "Arthur lay panting for breath.",

        "here how about this?\u2019 Desperately he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand \u2013 he hummed the first bar of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth.",
        "\u2018Da da da dum! Doesn\u2019t that stir anything in you?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the guard, \u2018not really.",
        "But I\u2019ll mention it to my aunt.\u2019 If he said anything further after that it was lost.",
        "The hatchway sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost bar the faint distant hum of the ship\u2019s engines.",
        "They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six feet in diameter and ten feet long.",
        "Ford looked round it, panting.",
        "\u2018Potentially bright lad I thought,\u2019 he said and slumped against the curved wall.",

        "Perhaps you thought of something and I didn\u2019t notice.\u2019 \u2018Oh yes, I thought of something,\u2019 panted Ford.",
        "Arthur looked up expectantly.",
        "\u2018But unfortunately,\u2019 continued Ford, \u2018it rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway.\u2019 He kicked the hatch they\u2019d just been thrown through.",

        "Not much point now, is there?\u2019 \u2018So...",
        "er, what happens next?\u2019 asked Arthur.",
        "\u2018Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect and asphyxiate.",
        "If you take a lungful of air with you you can last for up to thirty seconds, of course...\u2019 said Ford.",
        "He stuck his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum an old Betelgeusian battle hymn.",
        "To Arthur\u2019s eyes he suddenly looked very alien.",
        "\u2018So this is it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we are going to die.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018except...",
        "no! Wait a minute!\u2019 He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur\u2019s line of vision.",
        "\u2018What\u2019s this switch?\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018What? Where?\u2019 cried Arthur, twisting round.",
        "\u2018No, I was only fooling,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018we are going to die after all.\u2019 He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from where he had left off.",
        "\u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it\u2019s at times like this, when I\u2019m trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space, that I really wish I\u2019d listened to what my mother told me when I was young.\u2019 \u2018Why, what did she tell you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t listen.\u2019 \u2018Oh.\u2019 Ford carried on humming.",
        "\u2018This is terrific,\u2019 Arthur thought to himself, \u2018Nelson\u2019s Column has gone, McDonald\u2019s have gone, all that\u2019s left is me and the words Mostly harmless.",
        "Any second now all that will be left is Mostly harmless.",
        "And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so well.\u2019 A motor whirred.",
        "A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the outer hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny impossibly bright points of light.",

        "8 The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book.",
        "It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many years and under many different editorships.",
        "It contains contributions from countless numbers of travellers and researchers.",
        "The introduction begins like this: \u2018Space,\u2019 it says, \u2018is big.",
        "Really big.",
        "You just won\u2019t believe how vastly hugely mindbogglingly big it is.",
        "I mean you may think it\u2019s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that\u2019s just peanuts to space.",
        "Listen...\u2019 and so on.",
        "(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell you things you really need to know, like the fact that the fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory there it is vitally important to get a receipt.) To be fair, though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of the distances between the stars, better minds than the one responsible for the Guide\u2019s introduction have faltered.",
        "Some invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in Reading and a small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.",
        "The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into the human imagination.",
        "Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time to journey between the stars.",
        "It takes eight minutes to journey from the star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years more to arrive at Sol\u2019s nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.",
        "For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand years.",
        "The record for hitchhiking this distance is just under five years, but you don\u2019t get to see much on the way.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds.",
        "However, it does go on to say that what with space being the mindboggling size it is the chances of getting picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to the power of two hundred and seventy six thousand seven hundred and nine to one against.",
        "By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off with \u2013 she went off with a gatecrasher.",
        "Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that twenty nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued.",
        "9 A computer chattered to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock open and close itself for no apparent reason.",
        "This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.",
        "A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy.",
        "It was exactly a nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and quite a lot of millions of light years from end to end.",
        "As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of it and drifted off through the universe.",
        "A team of seven three foot high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of asphyxiation, partly of surprise.",
        "Two hundred and thirty nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out of it too, materializing in a large wobbly heap on the famine struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system.",
        "The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later.",
        "The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion.",
        "Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily unlikely patterns.",
        "These patterns quickly learnt to copy themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary about the patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet they drifted on to.",
        "That was how life began in the Universe.",
        "Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason and spewed up a pavement.",
        "On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like half spent fish.",
        "\u2018There you are,\u2019 gasped Ford, scrabbling for a finger hold on the pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, \u2018I told you I\u2019d think of something.\u2019 \u2018Oh sure,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018sure.\u2019 \u2018Bright idea of mine,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it.\u2019 The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them.",
        "Various pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats.",
        "Primal light exploded, splattering space\u2013time as with gobbets of junket.",
        "Time blossomed, matter shrank away.",
        "The highest prime number coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever.",
        "\u2018Oh, come off it,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018the chances against it were astronomical.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t knock it, it worked,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018What sort of ship are we in?\u2019 asked Arthur as the pit of eternity yawned beneath them.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I haven\u2019t opened my eyes yet.\u2019 \u2018No, nor have I,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several unexpected directions.",
        "Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in considerable surprise.",
        "\u2018Good God,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018it looks just like the sea front at Southend.\u2019 \u2018Hell, I\u2019m relieved to hear you say that,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Because I thought I must be going mad.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps you are.",
        "Perhaps you only thought I said it.\u2019 Ford thought about this.",
        "\u2018Well, did you say it or didn\u2019t you?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u2018I think so,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well, perhaps we\u2019re both going mad.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018we\u2019d be mad, all things considered, to think this was Southend.\u2019 \u2018Well, do you think this is Southend?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes.\u2019 \u2018So do I.\u2019 \u2018Therefore we must be mad.\u2019 \u2018Nice day for it.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said a passing maniac.",
        "\u2018Who was that?\u2019 asked Arthur.",
        "\u2018Who \u2013 the man with the five heads and the elder berry bush full of kippers?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know.",
        "Just someone.\u2019 \u2018Ah.\u2019 They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced railings to the Uncertain Areas.",
        "\u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur with a slight cough, \u2018if this is Southend, there\u2019s something very odd about it...\u2019 \u2018You mean the way the sea stays steady as a rock and the buildings keep washing up and down?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Yes, I thought that was odd too.",
        "In fact,\u2019 he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself into six equal segments which danced and spun giddily round each other in lewd and licentious formations, \u2018there is something altogether very strange going on.\u2019 Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind, hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a run for it.",
        "They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling bats and suddenly heard a girl\u2019s voice.",
        "It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, \u2018Two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling,\u2019 and that was all.",
        "Ford skidded down a beam of light and spun round trying to find a source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously believe in.",

        "\u2018Where are you? What\u2019s going on and is there any way of stopping it?\u2019 \u2018Please relax,\u2019 said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on fire, \u2018you are perfectly safe.\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s not the point!\u2019 raged Ford.",

        "It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government\u2019s research team on Damogran.",
        "This, briefly, is the story of its discovery.",
        "The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood \u2013 and such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess\u2019s undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left, in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.",
        "Many respectable physicists said that they weren\u2019t going to stand for this \u2013 partly because it was a debasement of science, but mostly because they didn\u2019t get invited to those sort of parties.",
        "Another thing they couldn\u2019t stand was the perpetual failure they encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship across the mind paralysing distances between the furthest stars, and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was virtually impossible.",
        "Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning this way: If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability.",
        "So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea...",
        "and turn it on! He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden infinite improbability generator out of thin air.",
        "It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the Galactic Institute\u2019s Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally realized that the one thing they really couldn\u2019t stand was a smartass.",
        "11 The improbability proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was perfectly clean because it was so new.",
        "Some of the control seats hadn\u2019t had the plastic wrapping taken off yet.",
        "The cabin was mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish restaurant.",
        "In fact it wasn\u2019t perfectly oblong: the two long walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the angles and corners of the cabin were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes.",
        "The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary three dimensional oblong room, but then the designers would have got miserable.",
        "As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful, with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers set into the convex wall.",
        "In one corner a robot sat humped, its gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming brushed steel knees.",
        "It too was fairly new, but though it was beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn\u2019t quite fit properly.",
        "In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with excitement.",

        "In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.",
        "And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had split before \u2013 and thus was the Empire forged.",
        "Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor \u2013 at least no one worth speaking of.",
        "And for all the richest and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the fault of the worlds they\u2019d settled on \u2013 none of them was entirely satisfactory: either the climate wasn\u2019t quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.",
        "And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of specialist industry: custom made luxury planet building.",
        "The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it into dream planets \u2013 gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber planets with lots of earthquakes \u2013 all lovingly made to meet the exacting standards that the Galaxy\u2019s richest men naturally came to expect.",
        "But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy was reduced to abject poverty.",
        "And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion hungry worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars as they laboured into the night over smug little treatises on the value of a planned political economy.",

        "\u2018All right, just supposing there\u2019s something, I take it you\u2019re not here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all.",
        "What are you after?\u2019 One of Zaphod\u2019s heads looked away.",
        "The other one looked round to see what the first was looking at, but it wasn\u2019t looking at anything very much.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Zaphod airily, \u2018it\u2019s partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it\u2019s the fame and the money...\u2019 Ford glanced at him sharply.",
        "He got a very strong impression that Zaphod hadn\u2019t the faintest idea why he was there at all.",
        "\u2018You know, I don\u2019t like the look of that planet at all,\u2019 said Trillian, shivering.",
        "\u2018Ah, take no notice,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018with half the wealth of the former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to look frumpy.\u2019 Bullshit, thought Ford.",
        "Even supposing this was the home of some ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would still have meaning now.",
        "He shrugged.",
        "\u2018I think it\u2019s just a dead planet,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018The suspense is killing me,\u2019 said Arthur testily.",
        "Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation should not be in any way exacerbated that the following facts will now be revealed in advance.",
        "The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.",
        "The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of three coffee cups and a mousecage, the bruising of somebody\u2019s upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl of petunias and an innocent sperm whale.",
        "In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustains the bruise.",
        "This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense since it is of no significance whatsoever.",
        "17 After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur\u2019s mind was beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments the previous day had left him with.",
        "He had found a Nutri Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
        "The way it functioned was very interesting.",
        "When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject\u2019s taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject\u2019s metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject\u2019s brain to see what was likely to go down well.",
        "However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
        "The Nutri Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, whose complaints department now covers all the major land masses of the first three planets in the Sirius Tau star system.",
        "Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving.",
        "He glanced up at the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren greyness slide past.",
        "It suddenly occurred to him to ask a question which had been bothering him.",
        "\u2018Is it safe?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Magrathea\u2019s been dead for five million years,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018of course it\u2019s safe.",
        "Even the ghosts will have settled down and raised families by now.\u2019 At which point a strange and inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge \u2013 a noise as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound.",
        "It preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and insubstantial.",
        "The voice said \u2018Greetings to you...\u2019 Someone from the dead planet was talking to them.",
        "\u2018Computer!\u2019 shouted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Hi there!\u2019 \u2018What the photon is it?\u2019 \u2018Oh, just some five million year old tape that\u2019s being broadcast at us.\u2019 \u2018A what? A recording?\u2019 \u2018Shush!\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s carrying on.\u2019 The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was underscored with quite unmistakable menace.",
        "\u2018This is a recorded announcement,\u2019 it said, \u2018as I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re all out at the moment.",
        "The commercial council of Magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit...\u2019 (\u2018A voice from ancient Magrathea!\u2019 shouted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018OK, OK,\u2019 said Ford.) \u2018...",
        "but regrets,\u2019 continued the voice, \u2018that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business.",
        "Thank you.",
        "If you would care to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone.\u2019 A short buzz followed, then silence.",
        "\u2018They want to get rid of us,\u2019 said Trillian nervously.",
        "\u2018What do we do?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s just a recording,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018We keep going.",
        "Got that, computer?\u2019 \u2018I got it,\u2019 said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of speed.",
        "They waited.",
        "After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the voice.",
        "\u2018We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able to select from all that\u2019s best in contemporary geography.\u2019 The menace in the voice took on a sharper edge.",
        "\u2018Meanwhile we thank our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave.",
        "Now.\u2019 Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.",
        "\u2018Well, I suppose we\u2019d better be going, then, hadn\u2019t we?\u2019 he suggested.",
        "\u2018Shhh!\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018There\u2019s absolutely nothing to be worried about.\u2019 \u2018Then why\u2019s everyone so tense?\u2019 \u2018They\u2019re just interested!\u2019 shouted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Computer, start a descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing.\u2019 This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice now distinctly cold.",
        "\u2018It is most gratifying,\u2019 it said, \u2018that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are part of a special service we extend to all of our most enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of course merely a courtesy detail.",
        "We look forward to your custom in future lives...",
        "Thank you.\u2019 The voice snapped off.",
        "\u2018Oh,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018Er...\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018will you get it into your heads? That\u2019s just a recorded message.",
        "It\u2019s millions of years old.",
        "It doesn\u2019t apply to us, get it?\u2019 \u2018What,\u2019 said Trillian quietly, \u2018about the missiles?\u2019 \u2018Missiles? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u2019 Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear screen.",
        "Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship.",
        "A quick change of magnification brought them into close focus \u2013 two massively real rockets thundering through the sky.",
        "The suddenness of it was shocking.",
        "\u2018I think they\u2019re going to have a very good try at applying to us,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "Zaphod stared at them in astonishment.",
        "\u2018Hey, this is terrific!\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Someone down there is trying to kill us!\u2019 \u2018Terrific,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018But don\u2019t you see what this means?\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "We\u2019re going to die.\u2019 \u2018Yes, but apart from that.\u2019 \u2018Apart from that?\u2019 \u2018It means we must be on to something!\u2019 \u2018How soon can we get off it?\u2019 Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen grew larger.",
        "They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head on.",
        "\u2018As a matter of interest,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018what are we going to do?\u2019 \u2018Just keep cool,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Is that all?\u2019 shouted Arthur.",
        "\u2018No, we\u2019re also going to...",
        "er...",
        "take evasive action!\u2019 said Zaphod with a sudden access of panic.",
        "\u2018Computer, what evasive action can we take?\u2019 \u2018Er, none I\u2019m afraid, guys,\u2019 said the computer.",
        "or something,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018...",
        "er...\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018There seems to be something jamming my guidance systems,\u2019 explained the computer brightly.",
        "\u2018Impact minus forty five seconds.",
        "Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax.\u2019 Zaphod tried to run several equally decisive directions simultaneously.",
        "\u2018Right!\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Er...",
        "we\u2019ve got to get manual control of this ship.\u2019 \u2018Can you fly her?\u2019 asked Ford pleasantly.",
        "\u2018No, can you?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Trillian, can you?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 \u2018Fine,\u2019 said Zaphod, relaxing.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ll do it together.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t either,\u2019 said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to assert himself.",
        "\u2018I\u2019d guessed that,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018OK, computer, I want full manual control now.\u2019 \u2018You got it,\u2019 said the computer.",
        "Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled up cellophane: these controls had never been used before.",
        "Zaphod stared at them wildly.",
        "\u2018OK, Ford,\u2019 he said, \u2018full retro thrust and ten degrees starboard.",
        "Or something...\u2019 \u2018Good luck, guys,\u2019 chirped the computer, \u2018impact minus thirty seconds...\u2019 Ford leapt to the controls \u2013 only a few of them made any immediate sense to him so he pulled those.",
        "The ship shook and screamed as its guidance rocket jets tried to push it every which way simultaneously.",
        "He released half of them and the ship spun round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come, straight towards the oncoming missiles.",
        "Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone was thrown against them.",
        "For a few seconds the inertial forces held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move.",
        "Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the guidance system.",
        "The lever snapped off.",
        "The ship twisted sharply and rocketed upwards.",
        "The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin.",
        "Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy smashed into another section of the control console with the combined result that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly dropped out of the sky like a stone.",
        "It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm.",
        "This should be emphasized because, as has already been revealed, they escape otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do not eventually hit the ship.",
        "The safety of the crew is absolutely assured.",
        "\u2018Impact minus twenty seconds, guys...\u2019 said the computer.",
        "\u2018Then turn the bloody engines back on!\u2019 bawled Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Oh, sure thing, guys,\u2019 said the computer.",
        "With a subtle roar the engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive and headed back towards the missiles again.",
        "The computer started to sing.",
        "\u2018When you walk through the storm...\u2019 it whined nasally, \u2018hold your head up high...\u2019 Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching destruction.",
        "\u2018And don\u2019t...",
        "be afraid...",
        "of the dark!\u2019 Eddie wailed.",
        "The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems.",
        "\u2018At the end of the storm...\u2019 crooned Eddie.",
        "The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they thundered towards the ship.",
        "is a golden sky...\u2019 But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving ship, and they passed right under it.",
        "\u2018and the sweet silver song of the lark...",
        "Revised impact time fifteen seconds, fellas...",
        "Walk on through the wind...\u2019 The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back into pursuit.",
        "\u2018This is it,\u2019 said Arthur watching them.",
        "\u2018We are now quite definitely going to die, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 \u2018I wish you\u2019d stop saying that,\u2019 shouted Ford.",
        "\u2018Well, we are, aren\u2019t we?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Walk on through the rain...\u2019 sang Eddie.",
        "A thought struck Arthur.",
        "He struggled to his feet.",
        "\u2018Why doesn\u2019t anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018We could probably reach that.\u2019 \u2018What are you, crazy?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Without proper programming anything could happen.\u2019 \u2018Does that matter at this stage?\u2019 shouted Arthur.",
        "\u2018Though your dreams be tossed and blown...\u2019 sang Eddie.",
        "Arthur scrambled up on to one of the excitingly chunky pieces of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the ceiling.",
        "\u2018Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart...\u2019 \u2018Does anyone know why Arthur can\u2019t turn on the Improbability Drive?\u2019 shouted Trillian.",
        "\u2018And you\u2019ll never walk alone...",
        "Impact minus five seconds, it\u2019s been great knowing you, guys, God bless...",
        "You\u2019ll ne...",
        "ver...",
        "walk...",
        "alone!\u2019 \u2018I said,\u2019 yelled Trillian, \u2018does anyone know\u2014\u2019 The next thing that happened was a mind mangling explosion of noise and light.",
        "18 And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather fetchingly redesigned interior.",
        "It was somewhat larger, and done out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue.",
        "In the centre a spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial pedestal housed the main computer terminal.",
        "Cunningly deployed lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured garden.",
        "Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood marble topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought iron legs.",
        "As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the instruments materialized instantly under your hands.",
        "Looked at from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they were reflected from.",
        "It was in fact sensationally beautiful.",
        "Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019 \u2018Well, I was just saying,\u2019 said Arthur, lounging by a small fish pool, \u2018there\u2019s this Improbability Drive switch over here...\u2019 He waved at where it had been.",
        "There was a potted plant there now.",
        "\u2018But where are we?\u2019 said Ford, who was sitting on the spiral staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his hand.",
        "\u2018Exactly where we were, I think...\u2019 said Trillian, as all about them the mirrors suddenly showed them an image of the blighted landscape of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them.",
        "Zaphod leapt out of his seat.",
        "\u2018Then what\u2019s happened to the missiles?\u2019 he said.",
        "A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.",
        "\u2018They would appear,\u2019 said Ford doubtfully, \u2018to have turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale...\u2019 \u2018At an improbability factor,\u2019 cut in Eddie, who hadn\u2019t changed a bit, \u2018of eight million seven hundred and sixty seven thousand one hundred and twenty eight to one against.\u2019 Zaphod stared at Arthur.",
        "\u2018Did you think of that, Earthman?\u2019 he demanded.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018all I did was...\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s very good thinking, you know.",
        "Turn on the Improbability Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens.",
        "Hey, kid, you just saved our lives, you know that?\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018well, it was nothing really...\u2019 \u2018Was it?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Oh well, forget it, then.",
        "OK, computer, take us in to land.\u2019 \u2018But...\u2019 \u2018I said forget it.\u2019 Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet.",
        "And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more.",
        "This is a complete record of its thought from the moment it began its life till the moment it ended it.",
        "Ah...! What\u2019s happening? it thought.",
        "Er, excuse me, who am I? Hello? Why am I here? What\u2019s my purpose in life? What do I mean by who am I? Calm down, get a grip now...",
        "Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is it? It\u2019s a sort of...",
        "yawning, tingling sensation in my...",
        "my...",
        "well I suppose I\u2019d better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let\u2019s call it my stomach.",
        "Good.",
        "Ooooh, it\u2019s getting quite strong.",
        "And hey, what about this whistling roaring sound going past what I\u2019m suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that...",
        "wind! Is that a good name? It\u2019ll do...",
        "perhaps I can find a better name for it later when I\u2019ve found out what it\u2019s for.",
        "It must be something very important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of it.",
        "Hey! What\u2019s this thing? This...",
        "let\u2019s call it a tail \u2013 yeah, tail.",
        "Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good, can\u2019t I? Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn\u2019t seem to achieve very much but I\u2019ll probably find out what it\u2019s for later on.",
        "Now \u2013 have I built up any coherent picture of things yet? No.",
        "Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, so much to look forward to, I\u2019m quite dizzy with anticipation...",
        "Or is it the wind? There really is a lot of that now, isn\u2019t there? And wow! Hey! What\u2019s this thing suddenly coming towards me very fast? Very very fast.",
        "So big and flat and round, it needs a big wide sounding name like...",
        "ow...",
        "ound...",
        "round...",
        "ground! That\u2019s it! That\u2019s a good name \u2013 ground! I wonder if it will be friends with me? And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.",
        "Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was, Oh no, not again.",
        "Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.",
        "19 \u2018Are we taking this robot with us?\u2019 said Ford, looking with distaste at Marvin, who was standing in an awkward hunched posture in the corner under a small palm tree.",
        "Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of Gold had now landed.",
        "\u2018Oh, the Paranoid Android,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll take him.\u2019 \u2018But what are you supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?\u2019 \u2018You think you\u2019ve got problems,\u2019 said Marvin as if he was addressing a newly occupied coffin, \u2018what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don\u2019t bother to answer that, I\u2019m fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don\u2019t know the answer.",
        "It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.\u2019 Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin.",
        "\u2018My white mice have escaped!\u2019 she said.",
        "An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of Zaphod\u2019s faces.",
        "\u2018Nuts to your white mice,\u2019 he said.",
        "Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again.",
        "It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater attention had it been generally realized that human beings were only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent observers) the second.",
        "\u2018Good afternoon, boys.\u2019 The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different.",
        "It had a matriarchal twang.",
        "It announced itself to the crew as they arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the planet surface.",
        "They looked at each other in puzzlement.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s the computer,\u2019 explained Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I discovered it had an emergency back up personality that I thought might work out better.\u2019 \u2018Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new planet,\u2019 continued Eddie\u2019s new voice, \u2018so I want you all wrapped up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug eyed monsters.\u2019 Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he said, \u2018I think we might be better off with a slide rule.\u2019 \u2018Right!\u2019 snapped the computer.",
        "\u2018Who said that?\u2019 \u2018Will you open up the exit hatch, please, computer?\u2019 said Zaphod, trying not to get angry.",
        "\u2018Not until whoever said that owns up,\u2019 urged the computer, stamping a few synapses closed.",
        "\u2018Oh God,\u2019 muttered Ford.",
        "He slumped against a bulkhead and started to count to ten.",
        "He was desperately worried that one day sentient life forms would forget how to do this.",
        "Only by counting could humans demonstrate their independence of computers.",
        "\u2018Come on,\u2019 said Eddie sternly.",
        "\u2018Computer\u2014\u2019 began Zaphod.",

        "\u2018I can wait all day if necessary...\u2019 \u2018Computer...\u2019 said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground, \u2018if you don\u2019t open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large axe, got that?\u2019 Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this.",
        "Ford carried on counting quietly.",
        "This is about the most aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of going up to a human being and saying, \u2018Blood...",
        "blood...",
        "blood...",
        "blood...\u2019 Finally Eddie said quietly, \u2018I can see this relationship is something we\u2019re all going to have to work at,\u2019 and the hatchway opened.",
        "An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea.",
        "\u2018It\u2019ll all end in tears, I know it,\u2019 shouted Eddie after them and closed the hatchway again.",
        "A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatch way again in response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise.",
        "20 Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land.",
        "Bits of it were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it rather less interesting to look at.",
        "It was like a dried out marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of dust about an inch thick.",
        "It was very cold.",
        "Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it.",
        "He stalked off by himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the ground.",
        "The wind stung Arthur\u2019s eyes and ears, and the stale thin air clasped his throat.",
        "However, the thing that was stung most was his mind.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s fantastic...\u2019 he said, and his own voice rattled his ears.",
        "Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere.",
        "\u2018Desolate hole, if you ask me,\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018I could have more fun in a cat litter.\u2019 He felt a mounting irritation.",
        "Of all the planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy \u2013 many wild and exotic, seething with life \u2013 didn\u2019t he just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of being a castaway? Not even a hotdog stand in evidence.",
        "He stooped down and picked up a cold clod of earth, but there was nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years to look at.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 insisted Arthur, \u2018don\u2019t you understand, this is the first time I\u2019ve actually stood on the surface of another planet...",
        "a whole alien world...! Pity it\u2019s such a dump, though.\u2019 Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned.",
        "She could have sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind them.",
        "She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them to come and join him.",
        "He seemed to be excited, but they couldn\u2019t clearly hear what he was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind.",
        "As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware that it seemed to be circular \u2013 a crater about a hundred and fifty yards wide.",
        "Round the outside of the crater the sloping ground was splattered with black and red lumps.",
        "They stopped and looked at a piece.",
        "It was wet.",
        "It was rubbery.",
        "With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.",
        "At the top of the crater\u2019s lip they met Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 he said, pointing into the crater.",
        "In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale that hadn\u2019t lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot.",
        "The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms of Trillian\u2019s throat.",
        "\u2018I suppose there\u2019s no point in trying to bury it?\u2019 murmured Arthur, and then wished he hadn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018Come,\u2019 said Zaphod and started back down into the crater.",
        "\u2018What, down there?\u2019 said Trillian with severe distaste.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018come on, I\u2019ve got something to show you.\u2019 \u2018We can see it,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018Not that,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018something else.",
        "Come on.\u2019 They all hesitated.",
        "\u2018Come on,\u2019 insisted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve found a way in.\u2019 \u2018In?\u2019 said Arthur in horror.",
        "\u2018Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage.",
        "The force of the whale\u2019s impact cracked it open, and that\u2019s where we have to go.",
        "Where no man has trod these five million years, into the very depths of time itself...\u2019 Marvin started his ironical humming again.",
        "Zaphod hit him and he shut up.",
        "With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the incline into the crater, trying very hard to avoid looking at its unfortunate creator.",
        "\u2018Life,\u2019 said Marvin dolefully, \u2018loathe it or ignore it, you can\u2019t like it.\u2019 The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by collapsed rubble and entrails.",
        "Zaphod had made a start clearing a way into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster.",
        "Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom.",
        "\u2018According to the legends,\u2019 he said, \u2018the Magratheans lived most of their lives underground.\u2019 \u2018Why\u2019s that?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Did the surface become too polluted or overpopulated?\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I think they just didn\u2019t like it very much.\u2019 \u2018Are you sure you know what you\u2019re doing?\u2019 said Trillian, peering nervously into the darkness.",
        "\u2018We\u2019ve been attacked once already, you know.\u2019 \u2018Look, kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is nil plus the four of us, so come on, let\u2019s get on in there.",
        "Er, hey, Earthman...\u2019 \u2018Arthur,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Yeah, could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard this end of the passageway.",
        "OK?\u2019 \u2018Guard?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018What from? You just said there\u2019s no one here.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Whose? Yours or mine?\u2019 \u2018Good lad.",
        "OK, here we go.\u2019 Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and Ford.",
        "\u2018Well, I hope you all have a really miserable time,\u2019 complained Arthur.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 Marvin assured him, \u2018they will.\u2019 In a few seconds they had disappeared from view.",
        "Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale\u2019s graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in.",
        "Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself off.",
        "Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but trying to hide it by striding purposefully.",
        "He flung the torch beam around.",
        "The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold to the touch, the air thick with decay.",
        "\u2018There, what did I tell you?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018An inhabited planet.",
        "Magrathea.\u2019 And he strode on through the dirt and debris that littered the tile floors.",
        "Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground, though it was less thoroughly squalid.",
        "At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics \u2013 simple angular patterns in bright colours.",
        "Trillian stopped and studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them.",
        "She called to Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?\u2019 \u2018I think they\u2019re just strange symbols of some kind,\u2019 said Zaphod, hardly glancing back.",
        "Trillian shrugged and hurried after him.",
        "From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict computer equipment.",
        "He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look.",
        "Trillian followed.",
        "\u2018Look,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018you reckon this is Magrathea...\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018and we heard the voice, right?\u2019 \u2018OK, so I\u2019ve bought the fact that it\u2019s Magrathea \u2013 for the moment.",
        "What you have so far said nothing about is how in the Galaxy you found it.",
        "You didn\u2019t just look it up in a star atlas, that\u2019s for sure.\u2019 \u2018Research.",
        "Government archives.",
        "Detective work.",
        "Few lucky guesses.",
        "Easy.\u2019 \u2018And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it with?\u2019 \u2018I stole it to look for a lot of things.\u2019 \u2018A lot of things?\u2019 said Ford in surprise.",
        "\u2018Like what?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 \u2018Because...",
        "because...",
        "I think it might be because if I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to look for them.\u2019 \u2018What, are you, crazy?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a possibility I haven\u2019t ruled out yet,\u2019 said Zaphod quietly.",
        "\u2018I only know as much about myself as my mind can work out under its current conditions.",
        "And its current conditions are not good.\u2019 For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with a mind suddenly full of worry.",
        "\u2018Listen, old friend, if you want to...\u2019 started Ford eventually.",
        "\u2018No, wait...",
        "I\u2019ll tell you something,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I freewheel a lot.",
        "I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it.",
        "I reckon I\u2019ll become President of the Galaxy, and it just happens, it\u2019s easy.",
        "I decide to steal this ship.",
        "I decide to look for Magrathea, and it all just happens.",
        "Yeah, I work out how it can best be done, right, but it always works out.",
        "It\u2019s like having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you never send off the cheques.",
        "And then whenever I stop and think \u2013 why did I want to do something? \u2013 how did I work out how to do it? \u2013 I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it.",
        "Like I have now.",
        "It\u2019s a big effort to talk about it.\u2019 Zaphod paused for a while.",
        "For a while there was silence.",
        "Then he frowned and said, \u2018Last night I was worrying about this again.",
        "About the fact that part of my mind just didn\u2019t seem to work properly.",
        "Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without telling me about it.",
        "I put the two ideas together and decided that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that purpose, which was why I couldn\u2019t use it.",
        "I wondered if there was a way I could check.",
        "\u2018I went to the ship\u2019s medical bay and plugged myself into the encephelographic screen.",
        "I went through every major screening test on both my heads \u2013 all the tests I had to go through under government medical officers before my nomination for the Presidency could be properly ratified.",
        "They showed up nothing.",
        "Nothing unexpected, at least.",
        "They showed that I was clever, imaginative, irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn\u2019t have guessed.",
        "And no other anomalies.",
        "So I started inventing further tests, completely at random.",
        "Nothing.",
        "Then I tried superimposing the results from one head on top of the results from the other head.",
        "Still nothing.",
        "Finally I got silly, because I\u2019d given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia.",
        "Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed picture and look at it through a green filter.",
        "You remember I was always superstitious about the colour green when I was a kid? I always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?\u2019 Ford nodded.",
        "\u2018And there it was,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018clear as day.",
        "A whole section in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and not to anything else around them.",
        "Some bastard had cauterized all the synapses and electronically traumatized those two lumps of cerebellum.\u2019 Ford stared at him, aghast.",
        "Trillian had turned white.",
        "\u2018Somebody did that to you?\u2019 whispered Ford.",
        "\u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018But have you any idea who? Or why?\u2019 \u2018Why? I can only guess.",
        "But I do know who the bastard was.\u2019 \u2018You know? How do you know?\u2019 \u2018Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized synapses.",
        "They left them there for me to see.\u2019 Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl.",
        "\u2018Initials? Burnt into your brain?\u2019 \u2018Yeah.\u2019 \u2018Well, what were they, for God\u2019s sake?\u2019 Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment.",
        "Then he looked away.",
        "B.,\u2019 he said quietly.",
        "At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas started to pour into the chamber.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll tell you about it later,\u2019 choked Zaphod as all three passed out.",
        "21 On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.",
        "Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with.",
        "He pushed a few buttons at random.",
        "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors like a good idea at the time.",
        "One of them (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then, after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem of what had happened to all the biros he\u2019d bought over the past few years.",
        "There followed a long period of painstaking research during which he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which quite caught the public imagination at the time.",
        "Somewhere in the cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and super intelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a planet entirely given over to biro life forms.",
        "And it was to this planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to highly biroorientated stimuli, and generally leading the biro equivalent of the good life.",
        "And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up, wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool of themselves in public.",
        "When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.",
        "There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious 60,000 Altairian dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox\u2019s highly profitable second hand biro business.",
        "Arthur read this, and put the book down.",
        "The robot still sat there, completely inert.",
        "Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater.",
        "He walked around the crater.",
        "He watched two suns set magnificently over Magrathea.",
        "He went back into the crater.",
        "He woke the robot up because even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than nobody.",
        "\u2018Night\u2019s falling,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Look, robot, the stars are coming out.\u2019 From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen.",
        "The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back.",
        "\u2018I know,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Wretched, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018But that sunset! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my wildest dreams...",
        "the two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling into space.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve seen it,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s rubbish.\u2019 \u2018We only ever had the one sun at home,\u2019 persevered Arthur, \u2018I came from a planet called Earth, you know.\u2019 \u2018I know,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018you keep going on about it.",
        "It sounds awful.\u2019 \u2018Ah no, it was a beautiful place.\u2019 \u2018Did it have oceans?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Arthur with a sigh, \u2018great wide rolling blue oceans...\u2019 \u2018Can\u2019t bear oceans,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018Tell me,\u2019 enquired Arthur, \u2018do you get on well with other robots?\u2019 \u2018Hate them,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018Where are you going?\u2019 Arthur couldn\u2019t bear any more.",
        "He had got up again.",

        "\u2018Don\u2019t blame you,\u2019 said Marvin and counted five hundred and ninety seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a second later.",
        "Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job.",
        "He trudged back up the wall of the crater.",
        "Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon, nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark.",
        "Because of this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he noticed him.",
        "22 He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon.",
        "He was tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe.",
        "When he turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with.",
        "But he didn\u2019t turn yet, not even to react to Arthur\u2019s yelp of surprise.",
        "Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and he turned.",
        "His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few yards away stood a small craft of some kind \u2013 a small hover craft, Arthur guessed.",
        "It shed a dim pool of light around it.",
        "The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.",
        "\u2018You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Who...",
        "who are you?\u2019 stammered Arthur.",
        "The man looked away.",
        "Again a look of sadness seemed to cross his face.",
        "\u2018My name is not important,\u2019 he said.",
        "He seemed to have something on his mind.",
        "Conversation was clearly something he felt he didn\u2019t have to rush at.",
        "Arthur felt awkward.",
        "\u2018I...",
        "er...",
        "you startled me...\u2019 he said, lamely.",
        "The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his eyebrows.",
        "\u2018Hmmm?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I said you startled me.\u2019 \u2018Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you.\u2019 Arthur frowned at him.",
        "\u2018But you shot at us! There were missiles...\u2019 he said.",
        "The man gazed into the pit of the crater.",
        "The slight glow from Marvin\u2019s eyes cast very faint red shadows on the huge carcass of the whale.",
        "The man chuckled slightly.",
        "\u2018An automatic system,\u2019 he said and gave a small sigh.",
        "\u2018Ancient computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks.",
        "I think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony.\u2019 He looked gravely at Arthur and said, \u2018I\u2019m a great fan of science, you know.\u2019 \u2018Oh...",
        "er, really?\u2019 said Arthur, who was beginning to find the man\u2019s curious, kindly manner disconcerting.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the old man, and simply stopped talking again.",
        "\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018er...\u2019 He had an odd feeling of being like a man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman\u2019s husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few idle remarks about the weather and leaves again.",
        "\u2018You seem ill at ease,\u2019 said the old man with polite concern.",
        "\u2018Er, no...",
        "well, yes.",
        "Actually you see, we weren\u2019t really expecting to find anybody about in fact.",
        "I sort of gathered that you were all dead or something...\u2019 \u2018Dead?\u2019 said the old man.",
        "\u2018Good gracious me no, we have but slept.\u2019 \u2018Slept?\u2019 said Arthur incredulously.",
        "\u2018Yes, through the economic recession, you see,\u2019 said the old man, apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word he was talking about or not.",
        "Arthur had to prompt him again.",
        "\u2018Er, economic recession?\u2019 \u2018Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy collapsed, and seeing that custom built planets are something of a luxury commodity, you see...\u2019 He paused and looked at Arthur.",
        "\u2018You know we built planets, do you?\u2019 he asked solemnly.",
        "\u2018Well yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I\u2019d sort of gathered...\u2019 \u2018Fascinating trade,\u2019 said the old man, and a wistful look came into his eyes, \u2018doing the coastlines was always my favourite.",
        "Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords...",
        "so anyway,\u2019 he said, trying to find his thread again, \u2018the recession came and we decided it would save a lot of bother if we just slept through it.",
        "So we programmed the computers to revive us when it was all over.\u2019 The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued.",
        "\u2018The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market prices, you see, so that we\u2019d all be revived when everybody else had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive services.\u2019 Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s a pretty unpleasant way to behave, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018Is it?\u2019 asked the old man mildly.",
        "\u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a bit out of touch.\u2019 He pointed down into the crater.",
        "\u2018Is that robot yours?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 came a thin metallic voice from the crater, \u2018I\u2019m mine.\u2019 \u2018If you\u2019d call it a robot,\u2019 muttered Arthur.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s more a sort of electronic sulking machine.\u2019 \u2018Bring it,\u2019 said the old man.",
        "Arthur was quite surprised to hear a note of decision suddenly present in the old man\u2019s voice.",
        "He called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of being lame, which he wasn\u2019t.",
        "\u2018On second thoughts,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018leave it here.",
        "You must come with me.",
        "Great things are afoot.\u2019 He turned towards his craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now drifted quietly towards them through the dark.",
        "Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater again muttering sour nothings to himself.",
        "\u2018Come,\u2019 called the old man, \u2018come now or you will be late.\u2019 \u2018Late?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018What for?\u2019 \u2018What is your name, human?\u2019 \u2018Dent.",
        "Arthur Dent,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent,\u2019 said the old man, sternly.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s a sort of threat you see.\u2019 Another wistful look came into his tired old eyes.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ve never been very good at them myself, but I\u2019m told they can be very effective.\u2019 Arthur blinked at him.",
        "\u2018What an extraordinary person,\u2019 he muttered to himself.",
        "\u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 said the old man.",
        "\u2018Oh nothing, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Arthur in embarrassment.",
        "\u2018All right, where do we go?\u2019 \u2018In my aircar,\u2019 said the man, motioning Arthur to get into the craft which had settled silently next to them.",
        "\u2018We are going deep into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being revived from its five million year slumber.",
        "Magrathea awakes.\u2019 Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the old man.",
        "The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of the craft as it soared into the night sky, quite unsettled him.",
        "He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow of tiny lights on the instrument panel.",
        "\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 he said to him, \u2018what is your name by the way?\u2019 \u2018My name?\u2019 said the old man, and the same distant sadness came into his face again.",
        "He paused.",
        "\u2018My name,\u2019 he said, \u2018...",
        "is Slartibartfast.\u2019 Arthur practically choked.",
        "\u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 he spluttered.",
        "\u2018Slartibartfast,\u2019 repeated the old man quietly.",
        "\u2018Slartibartfast?\u2019 The old man looked at him gravely.",
        "\u2018I said it wasn\u2019t important,\u2019 he said.",
        "The aircar sailed through the night.",
        "23 It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.",
        "For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much \u2013 the wheel, New York, wars and so on \u2013 whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.",
        "But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man \u2013 for precisely the same reasons.",
        "Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger; but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for titbits, so they eventually gave up and left the Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.",
        "The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the \u2018Star Spangled Banner\u2019, but in fact the message was this: So long, and thanks for all the fish.",
        "In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man.",
        "The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this relationship was entirely according to these creatures\u2019 plans.",
        "24 Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean night.",
        "It sped swiftly.",
        "Arthur\u2019s companion seemed sunk in his own thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that.",
        "Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling, but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any reference points.",
        "The sense of motion was so soft and slight he could almost believe they were hardly moving at all.",
        "Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make out what sort of craft it might be.",
        "He peered at it, but was unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm as the aircar dipped sharply and headed downwards in what seemed certain to be a collision course.",
        "Their relative velocity seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath before it was all over.",
        "The next thing he was aware of was an insane silver blur that seemed to surround him.",
        "He twisted his head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to realize what had happened.",
        "They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground.",
        "The colossal speed had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel.",
        "The insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an hour.",
        "He closed his eyes in terror.",
        "After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt.",
        "He opened his eyes again.",
        "They were still in the silver tunnel, threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a crisscross warren of converging tunnels.",
        "When they finally stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel.",
        "Several tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating light.",
        "It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes, it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far it was.",
        "Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultraviolet.",
        "Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old eyes.",
        "\u2018Earthman,\u2019 he said, \u2018we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea.\u2019 \u2018How did you know I was an Earthman?\u2019 demanded Arthur.",
        "\u2018These things will become clear to you,\u2019 said the old man gently, \u2018at least,\u2019 he added with slight doubt in his voice, \u2018clearer than they are at the moment.\u2019 He continued: \u2018I should warn you that the chamber we are about to pass into does not literally exist within our planet.",
        "It is a little too...",
        "large.",
        "We are about to pass through a gateway into a vast tract of hyperspace.",
        "It may disturb you.\u2019 Arthur made nervous noises.",
        "Slartibartfast, touched a button and added, not entirely reassuringly, \u2018It scares the willies out of me.",
        "Hold tight.\u2019 The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked like.",
        "It wasn\u2019t infinity, in fact.",
        "Infinity itself looks flat and uninteresting.",
        "Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity \u2013 distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless.",
        "The chamber into which the aircar emerged was anything but infinite, it was just very very very big, so big that it gave the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself.",
        "Arthur\u2019s senses bobbed and span as, travelling at the immense speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them.",
        "The wall.",
        "The wall defied the imagination \u2013 seduced it and defeated it.",
        "The wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and sides passed away beyond the reach of sight.",
        "The mere shock of vertigo could kill a man.",
        "The wall appeared perfectly flat.",
        "It would take the finest laser measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either side, it also curved.",
        "It met itself again thirteen light seconds away.",
        "In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with unimaginable light.",
        "\u2018Welcome,\u2019 said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept imperceptibly forward into the mind boggling space, \u2018welcome,\u2019 he said, \u2018to our factory floor.\u2019 Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror.",
        "Ranged away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes that hung in the space.",
        "\u2018This,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018is where we make most of our planets, you see.\u2019 \u2018You mean,\u2019 said Arthur, trying to form the words, \u2018you mean you\u2019re starting it all up again now?\u2019 \u2018No no, good heavens no,\u2019 exclaimed the old man, \u2018no, the Galaxy isn\u2019t nearly rich enough to support us yet.",
        "No, we\u2019ve been awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very...",
        "special clients from another dimension.",
        "It may interest you...",
        "there in the distance in front of us.\u2019 Arthur followed the old man\u2019s finger, till he was able to pick out the floating structure he was pointing out.",
        "It was indeed the only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of activity about it, though this was more a subliminal impression than anything one could put one\u2019s finger on.",
        "At that moment however a flash of light arced through the structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were formed on the dark sphere within.",
        "Patterns that Arthur knew, rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of words, part of the furniture of his mind.",
        "For a few seconds he sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense.",
        "Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated responsibility for any further thinking in that direction.",
        "The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.",
        "\u2018The Earth...\u2019 whispered Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact,\u2019 said Slartibartfast cheerfully.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re making a copy from our original blueprints.\u2019 There was a pause.",
        "\u2018Are you trying to tell me,\u2019 said Arthur, slowly and with control, \u2018that you originally...",
        "made the Earth?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Slartibartfast.",
        "\u2018Did you ever go to a place...",
        "I think it was called Norway?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018no, I didn\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Pity,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018that was one of mine.",
        "Won an award, you know.",
        "Lovely crinkly edges.",
        "I was most upset to hear of its destruction.\u2019 \u2018You were upset!\u2019 \u2018Yes.",
        "Five minutes later and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered so much.",
        "It was a quite shocking cock up.\u2019 \u2018Huh?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018The mice were furious.\u2019 \u2018The mice were furious?\u2019 \u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said the old man mildly.",
        "\u2018Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled platypuses, but...\u2019 \u2018Ah, but they hadn\u2019t paid for it, you see, had they?\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now?\u2019 For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence.",
        "Then the old man tried patiently to explain.",
        "\u2018Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for, and run by mice.",
        "It was destroyed five minutes before the completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we\u2019ve got to build another one.\u2019 Only one word was registering with Arthur.",
        "\u2018Mice?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Indeed, Earthman.\u2019 \u2018Look, sorry \u2013 are we talking about the little white furry things with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming in early sixties sit coms?\u2019 Slartibartfast coughed politely.",
        "\u2018Earthman,\u2019 he said, \u2018it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of speech.",
        "Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early sixties sit coms of which you speak.",
        "These creatures you call mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear.",
        "They are merely the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings.",
        "The whole business with the cheese and the squeaking is just a front.\u2019 The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued.",
        "\u2018They\u2019ve been experimenting on you, I\u2019m afraid.\u2019 Arthur thought about this for a moment, and then his face cleared.",
        "\u2018Ah no,\u2019 he said, \u2018I see the source of the misunderstanding now.",
        "No, look, you see, what happened was that we used to do experiments on them.",
        "They were often used in behavioural research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff.",
        "So what happened was that the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring bells, run round mazes and things so that the whole nature of the learning process could be examined.",
        "From our observations of their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about our own...\u2019 Arthur\u2019s voice tailed off.",
        "\u2018Such subtlety...\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018one has to admire it.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to guide your thinking? Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way, eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of myxomatosis \u2013 if it\u2019s finely calculated the cumulative effect is enormous.\u2019 He paused for effect.",
        "\u2018You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings.",
        "Your planet and people have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten million year research program...",
        "\u2018Let me tell you the whole story.",
        "It\u2019ll take a little time.\u2019 \u2018Time,\u2019 said Arthur weakly, \u2018is not currently one of my problems.\u2019 25 There are of course many problems connected with life, of which some of the most popular are: Why are people born? Why do they die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time wearing digital watches? Many many millions of years ago a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own pan dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all.",
        "And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer which was so amazingly intelligent that even before its data banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore I am and got as far as deducing the existence of rice pudding and income tax before anyone managed to turn it off.",
        "It was the size of a small city.",
        "Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest ultramahogany topped with rich ultrared leather.",
        "The dark carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and stately windows looked out upon a tree lined public square.",
        "On the day of the Great On Turning two soberly dressed programmers with briefcases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office.",
        "They were aware that this day they would represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves deferentially before the desk, opened their briefcases and took out their leather bound notebooks.",
        "Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.",
        "For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunk will leaned forward and touched a small black panel.",
        "The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now in total active mode.",
        "After a pause it spoke to them in a voice rich, resonant and deep.",
        "It said: \u2018What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space, have been called into existence?\u2019 Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.",
        "\u2018Your task, O Computer...\u2019 began Fook.",
        "\u2018No, wait a minute, this isn\u2019t right,\u2019 said Lunkwill, worried.",
        "\u2018We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever and we\u2019re not making do with second best.",
        "Deep Thought,\u2019 he addressed the computer, \u2018are you not as we designed you to be, the greatest, most powerful computer in all time?\u2019 \u2018I described myself as the second greatest,\u2019 intoned Deep Thought, \u2018and such I am.\u2019 Another worried look passed between the two programmers.",
        "Lunkwill cleared his throat.",
        "\u2018There must be some mistake,\u2019 he said, \u2018are you not a greater computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain at Maximegalon which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond?\u2019 \u2018The Milliard Gargantubrain?\u2019 said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt.",
        "\u2018A mere abacus \u2013 mention it not.\u2019 \u2018And are you not,\u2019 said Fook, leaning anxiously forward, \u2018a greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five week Dangrabad Beta sand blizzard?\u2019 \u2018A five week sand blizzard?\u2019 said Deep Thought haughtily.",
        "\u2018You ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket calculator stuff.\u2019 The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment.",
        "Then Lunkwill leaned forward again.",
        "\u2018But are you not,\u2019 he said, \u2018a more fiendish disputant than the Great Hyperlobic Omni Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus Twelve, the Magic and Indefatigable?\u2019 \u2018The Great Hyperlobic Omni Cognate Neutron Wrangler,\u2019 said Deep Thought, thoroughly rolling the rs, \u2018could talk all four legs off an Arcturan Mega donkey \u2013 but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.\u2019 \u2018Then what,\u2019 asked Fook, \u2018is the problem?\u2019 \u2018There is no problem,\u2019 said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing tones.",
        "\u2018I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.\u2019 \u2018But the second?\u2019 insisted Lunkwill.",
        "\u2018Why do you keep saying the second? You\u2019re surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid Perspicutron Titan Muller, are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the...\u2019 Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer\u2019s console.",

For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life, the Universe and Everything!\u2019 As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the speaker was addressing the crowd.",
        "He experienced a moment\u2019s panic as he sailed straight towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he found he had gone right through the solid glass without apparently touching it.",

        "\u2018We shouted and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us.",
        "This is all Sens O Tape.\u2019 Zaphod stared at him bitterly.",
        "\u2018Ah, shit,\u2019 he said, \u2018you wake me up from my own perfectly good dream to show me somebody else\u2019s.\u2019 He sat down in a huff.",

        "Bit dull.",
        "We thought you\u2019d like to see this one, though.\u2019 Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they looked.",
        "\u2018Very pretty,\u2019 said Zaphod petulantly.",
        "In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared.",
        "It flickered and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land.",
        "As with one voice they all went, \u2018Yuch.\u2019 The sea was purple.",
        "The beach they were on was composed of tiny yellow and green pebbles \u2013 presumably terribly precious stones.",
        "The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red peaks.",
        "Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly mauve parasol and silver tassels.",

        "It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you.",
        "We are not proud.",
        "And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on parachutes.",
        "In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime meadow full of cows.",

        "\u2018So I reckon, what\u2019s so secret that I can\u2019t let anybody know I know it, not the galactic government, not even myself? And the answer is I don\u2019t know.",

        "The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the Arcturans would supply them.",
        "There was a lot of trouble with space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars, and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic defence shields known to galactic science.",
        "They were real brutes of ships, and huge.",
        "In orbit round a planet they would eclipse the sun.",
        "\u2018One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one.",
        "On a tri jet scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid.",
        "I mean forget it, it was crazier than a mad monkey.",
        "I went along for the ride because I\u2019d got some very safe money on him not doing it, and didn\u2019t want him coming back with fake evidence.",
        "So what happens? We get in this tri jet which he had souped up into something totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, burst our way into a megafreighter I still don\u2019t know how, marched on to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers.",
        "A wilder thing I have not known.",

        "For what? Conkers.\u2019 \u2018The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018He gave us food, booze \u2013 stuff from really weird parts of the Galaxy \u2013 lots of conkers, of course, and we had just the most incredible time.",
        "Then he teleported us back.",
        "Into the maximum security wing of the Betelgeuse state prison.",

        "Dark mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked indistinctly in the shadows.",
        "The air was occasionally rent with the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings.",
        "Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to make it a paying proposition.",
        "\u2018Ford,\u2019 said Zaphod quietly.",

        "It was his idea that I should steal it.\u2019 \u2018His idea?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod, \u2018and the only possible way of stealing it was to be at the launching ceremony.\u2019 Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared with laughter.",
        "\u2018Are you telling me,\u2019 he said, \u2018that you set yourself up to become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get most people locked away in a room with soft walls.",

        "\u2018What\u2019s so important about having it?\u2019 \u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I think if I\u2019d consciously known what was so important about it and what I would need it for it would have shown up on the brain screening tests and I would never have passed.",
        "I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still locked away.\u2019 \u2018So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as a result of Yooden talking to you?\u2019 \u2018He was a hell of a talker.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself, you know.\u2019 Zaphod shrugged.",
        "\u2018I mean, don\u2019t you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?\u2019 asked Ford.",
        "Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his mind.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said at last.",
        "\u2018I don\u2019t seem to be letting myself into any of my secrets.",
        "Still,\u2019 he added on further reflection, \u2018I can understand that.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t trust myself further than I could spit a rat.\u2019 A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again.",
        "They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass top tables and design awards.",
        "A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them.",
        "\u2018The mice will see you now,\u2019 he said.",
        "30 \u2018So there you have it,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of his study.",
        "He picked up a piece of paper from the top of a pile, but then couldn\u2019t think of anywhere else to put it, so he put it back on top of the original pile which promptly fell over.",
        "\u2018Deep Thought designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it.\u2019 \u2018And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the program was completed,\u2019 added Arthur, not unbitterly.",

        "\u2018Ten million years of planning and work gone just like that.",
        "Ten million years, Earthman...",
        "can you conceive of that kind of time span? A galactic civilization could grow from a single worm five times over in that time.",
        "Gone.\u2019 He paused.",
        "\u2018Well, that\u2019s bureaucracy for you,\u2019 he added.",
        "\u2018You know,\u2019 said Arthur thoughtfully, \u2018all this explains a lot of things.",
        "All through my life I\u2019ve had this strange unaccountable feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said the old man, \u2018that\u2019s just perfectly normal paranoia.",
        "Everyone in the Universe has that.\u2019 \u2018Everyone?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well, if everyone has that perhaps it means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know...\u2019 \u2018Maybe.",
        "Who cares?\u2019 said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too excited.",
        "\u2018Perhaps I\u2019m old and tired,\u2019 he continued, \u2018but I always think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the sense of it and just keep yourself occupied.",
        "Look at me: I design coastlines.",
        "I got an award for Norway.\u2019 He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large Perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded into it.",
        "\u2018Where\u2019s the sense in that?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018None that I\u2019ve been able to make out.",
        "I\u2019ve been doing fjords all my life.",
        "For a fleeting moment they became fashionable and I get a major award.\u2019 He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn\u2019t land on something soft.",
        "\u2018In this replacement Earth we\u2019re building they\u2019ve given me Africa to do and of course I\u2019m doing it with all fjords again because I happen to like them, and I\u2019m old fashioned enough to think that they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent.",
        "And they tell me it\u2019s not equatorial enough.",
        "Equatorial!\u2019 He gave a hollow laugh.",
        "\u2018What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things, of course, but I\u2019d far rather be happy than right any day.\u2019 \u2018And are you?\u2019 \u2018No.",
        "That\u2019s where it all falls down, of course.\u2019 \u2018Pity,\u2019 said Arthur with sympathy.",
        "\u2018It sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise.\u2019 Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed.",
        "\u2018Come,\u2019 said Slartibartfast, \u2018you are to meet the mice.",
        "Your arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement.",
        "It has already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable event in the history of the Universe.\u2019 \u2018What were the first two?\u2019 \u2018Oh, probably just coincidences,\u2019 said Slartibartfast carelessly.",
        "He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow.",
        "Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on Thursday morning.",
        "\u2018I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,\u2019 he muttered to himself.",
        "\u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 asked the old man mildly.",
        "\u2018Oh nothing,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018only joking.\u2019 31 It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated.",
        "For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said \u2018I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle,\u2019 a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space\u2013time continuum and carried his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of space to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.",
        "The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time.",
        "A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the commander of the Vl\u2019hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G\u2019Gugvuntt leader squatting opposite him in a cloud of green sweet smelling steam, and, with a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother.",
        "The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table.",
        "Unfortunately, in the Vl\u2019hurg tongue this was the most dreadful insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage terrible war for centuries.",
        "Eventually of course, after their galaxy had been decimated over a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a joint attack on our own galaxy \u2013 now positively identified as the source of the offending remark.",
        "For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first planet they came across \u2013 which happened to be the Earth \u2013 where due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.",
        "Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s just life,\u2019 they say.",
        "A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a doorway.",
        "They left the car and went through the door into a waiting room full of glass topped tables and Perspex awards.",
        "Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other side of the room and they entered.",
        "\u2018Arthur! You\u2019re safe!\u2019 a voice said.",
        "\u2018Am I?\u2019 said Arthur, rather startled.",
        "\u2018Oh good.\u2019 The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and bizarre fruits.",
        "They were stuffing their faces.",
        "\u2018What happened to you?\u2019 demanded Arthur.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, \u2018our guests here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make it up to us.",
        "Here,\u2019 he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling meat from a bowl, \u2018have some Vegan rhino\u2019s cutlet.",
        "It\u2019s delicious if you happen to like that sort of thing.\u2019 \u2018Hosts?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018What hosts? I don\u2019t see any...\u2019 A small voice said, \u2018Welcome to lunch, Earth creature.\u2019 Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped.",
        "\u2018Ugh!\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018There are mice on the table!\u2019 There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at Arthur.",
        "He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like whisky glasses on the table.",
        "He heard the silence and glanced around at everyone.",
        "\u2018Oh!\u2019 he said, with sudden realization.",
        "\u2018Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I wasn\u2019t quite prepared for...\u2019 \u2018Let me introduce you,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018Arthur, this is Benjy mouse.\u2019 \u2018Hi,\u2019 said one of the mice.",
        "His whiskers stroked what must have been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky glass like affair, and it moved forward slightly.",
        "\u2018And this is Frankie mouse.\u2019 The other mouse said, \u2018Pleased to meet you,\u2019 and did likewise.",
        "Arthur gaped.",
        "\u2018But aren\u2019t they...\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Trillian, \u2018they are the mice I brought with me from the Earth.\u2019 She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the tiniest resigned shrug.",
        "\u2018Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?\u2019 she said.",
        "Slartibartfast coughed politely.",
        "\u2018Er, excuse me,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Yes, thank you, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Benjy mouse sharply, \u2018you may go.\u2019 \u2018What? Oh...",
        "er, very well,\u2019 said the old man, slightly taken aback.",
        "\u2018I\u2019ll just go and get on with some of my fjords then.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well in fact that won\u2019t be necessary,\u2019 said Frankie mouse.",
        "\u2018It looks very much as if we won\u2019t be needing the new Earth any longer.\u2019 He swivelled his pink little eyes.",
        "\u2018Not now that we have found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was destroyed.\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 cried Slartibartfast, aghast.",
        "\u2018You can\u2019t mean that! I\u2019ve got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!\u2019 \u2018Well, perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you dismantle them,\u2019 said Frankie, acidly.",
        "\u2018Skiing holiday!\u2019 cried the old man.",
        "\u2018Those glaciers are works of art! Elegantly sculpted contours, soaring pinnacles of ice, deep majestic ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high art!\u2019 \u2018Thank you, Slartibartfast,\u2019 said Benjy firmly.",
        "\u2018That will be all.\u2019 \u2018Yes sir,\u2019 said the old man coldly, \u2018thank you very much.",
        "Well, goodbye, Earthman,\u2019 he said to Arthur, \u2018hope the lifestyle comes together.\u2019 With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked sadly out of the room.",
        "Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say.",
        "\u2018Now,\u2019 said Benjy mouse, \u2018to business.\u2019 Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together.",
        "\u2018To business!\u2019 they said.",
        "\u2018I beg your pardon?\u2019 said Benjy.",
        "Ford looked round.",
        "\u2018Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast,\u2019 he said.",
        "The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass transports.",
        "Finally they composed themselves, and Benjy moved forward to address Arthur.",
        "\u2018Now, Earth creature,\u2019 he said, \u2018the situation we have in effect is this.",
        "We have, as you know, been more or less running your planet for the last ten million years in order to find this wretched thing called the Ultimate Question.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said Arthur, sharply.",
        "\u2018No \u2013 we already thought of that one,\u2019 said Frankie interrupting, \u2018but it doesn\u2019t fit the answer.",
        "Why? \u2013 Forty Two...",
        "you see, it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018I mean why have you been doing it?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I see,\u2019 said Frankie.",
        "\u2018Well, eventually just habit, I think, to be brutally honest.",
        "And this is more or less the point \u2013 we\u2019re sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing it all over again on account of those whinnet ridden Vogons quite frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benjy and I finished our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday, and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good offices of your friends.\u2019 \u2018Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension,\u2019 put in Benjy.",
        "\u2018Since when,\u2019 continued his murine colleague, \u2018we have had an offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D chat show and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the woods, and we\u2019re very much inclined to take it.\u2019 \u2018I would, wouldn\u2019t you, Ford?\u2019 said Zaphod promptingly.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018jump at it, like a shot.\u2019 Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up to.",
        "\u2018But we\u2019ve got to have product, you see,\u2019 said Frankie.",
        "\u2018I mean ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or other.\u2019 Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur.",
        "\u2018You see,\u2019 he said, \u2018if they\u2019re just sitting there in the studio looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and then eventually have to admit that in fact it\u2019s Forty two, then the show\u2019s probably quite short.",
        "No follow up, you see.\u2019 \u2018We have to have something that sounds good,\u2019 said Benjy.",
        "\u2018Something that sounds good?\u2019 exclaimed Arthur.",
        "\u2018An Ultimate Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?\u2019 The mice bristled.",
        "\u2018Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I\u2019m afraid where you begin to suspect that if there\u2019s any real truth, it\u2019s that the entire multi dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs.",
        "And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking the money and running, then I for one could do with the exercise,\u2019 said Frankie.",
        "\u2018But...\u2019 started Arthur, hopelessly.",
        "\u2018Hey, will you get this, Earthman,\u2019 interrupted Zaphod.",
        "\u2018You are a last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger, yeah?\u2019 \u2018Er...\u2019 \u2018So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate configuration of the computer program,\u2019 said Ford, rather lucidly he thought.",
        "\u2018Right?\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 said Arthur doubtfully.",
        "He wasn\u2019t aware of ever having felt an organic part of anything.",
        "He had always seen this as one of his problems.",
        "\u2018In other words,\u2019 said Benjy, steering his curious little vehicle right over to Arthur, \u2018there\u2019s a good chance that the structure of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain \u2013 so we want to buy it off you.\u2019 \u2018What, the question?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Ford and Trillian.",
        "\u2018For lots of money,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018No, no,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018it\u2019s the brain we want to buy.\u2019 \u2018What!\u2019 \u2018Well, who would miss it?\u2019 enquired Benjy.",
        "\u2018I thought you said you could just read his brain electronically,\u2019 protested Ford.",
        "\u2018Oh yes,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018but we\u2019d have to get it out first.",
        "It\u2019s got to be prepared.\u2019 \u2018Treated,\u2019 said Benjy.",
        "\u2018Diced.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing away from the table in horror.",
        "\u2018It could always be replaced,\u2019 said Benjy reasonably, \u2018if you think it\u2019s important.\u2019 \u2018Yes, an electronic brain,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018a simple one would suffice.\u2019 \u2018A simple one!\u2019 wailed Arthur.",
        "\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, \u2018you\u2019d just have to program it to say What? and I don\u2019t understand and Where\u2019s the tea? \u2013 who\u2019d know the difference?\u2019 \u2018What?\u2019 cried Arthur, backing away still further.",
        "\u2018See what I mean?\u2019 said Zaphod and howled with pain because of something Trillian did at that moment.",
        "\u2018I\u2019d notice the difference,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018No you wouldn\u2019t,\u2019 said Frankie mouse, \u2018you\u2019d be programmed not to.\u2019 Ford made for the door.",
        "\u2018Look, I\u2019m sorry, mice old lads,\u2019 he said, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a deal.\u2019 \u2018I rather think we have to have a deal,\u2019 said the mice in chorus, all the charm vanishing from their piping little voices in an instant.",
        "With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything.",
        "Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open, but Arthur was a dead weight \u2013 he seemed hypnotized by the airborne rodents swooping towards him.",
        "She screamed at him, but he just gaped.",
        "With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open.",
        "On the other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea.",
        "Not only were they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with them was also far from pretty.",
        "They charged.",
        "So \u2013 Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than they were.",
        "All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din.",
        "32 \u2018Emergency! Emergency!\u2019 blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea.",
        "\u2018Hostile ship has landed on planet.",
        "Armed intruders in section 8A.",
        "Defence stations, defence stations.\u2019 The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass transports where they lay shattered on the floor.",
        "\u2018Damnation,\u2019 muttered Frankie mouse, \u2018all that fuss over two pounds of Earthling brain.\u2019 He scuttled round and about, his pink eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static.",
        "\u2018The only thing we can do now,\u2019 said Benjy, crouching and stroking his whiskers in thought, \u2018is to try and fake a question, invent one that will sound plausible.\u2019 \u2018Difficult,\u2019 said Frankie.",
        "He thought.",
        "\u2018How about, What\u2019s yellow and dangerous?\u2019 Benjy considered this for a moment.",
        "\u2018No, no good,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Doesn\u2019t fit the answer.\u2019 They sank into silence for a few seconds.",
        "\u2018All right,\u2019 said Benjy.",
        "\u2018What do you get if you multiply six by seven?\u2019 \u2018No, no, too literal, too factual,\u2019 said Frankie, \u2018wouldn\u2019t sustain the punters\u2019 interest.\u2019 Again they thought.",
        "Then Frankie said: \u2018Here\u2019s a thought.",
        "How many roads must a man walk down?\u2019 \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Benjy.",
        "\u2018Aha, now that does sound promising!\u2019 He rolled the phrase around a little.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018that\u2019s excellent! Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to meaning anything at all.",
        "How many roads must a man walk down? Forty two.",
        "Excellent, excellent, that\u2019ll fox \u2019em.",
        "Frankie baby, we are made!\u2019 They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.",
        "Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards.",
        "Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for a way out.",
        "They emerged into a wide open plan computer bay.",
        "They glanced about wildly.",
        "\u2018Which way you reckon, Zaphod?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018At a wild guess, I\u2019d say down here,\u2019 said Zaphod, running off down to the right between a computer bank and the wall.",
        "As the others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill O Zap energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him and fried a small section of adjacent wall.",
        "A voice on a loud hailer said, \u2018OK, Beeblebrox, hold it right there.",
        "We\u2019ve got you covered.\u2019 \u2018Cops!\u2019 hissed Zaphod, and spun around in a crouch.",
        "\u2018You want to try a guess at all, Ford?\u2019 \u2018OK, this way,\u2019 said Ford, and the four of them ran down a gangway between two computer banks.",
        "At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space suited figure waving a vicious Kill O Zap gun.",
        "\u2018We don\u2019t want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!\u2019 shouted the figure.",
        "\u2018Suits me fine!\u2019 shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap between two data process units.",
        "The others swerved in behind him.",
        "\u2018There are two of them,\u2019 said Trillian.",
        "\u2018We\u2019re cornered.\u2019 They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large computer data bank and the wall.",
        "They held their breath and waited.",
        "Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously.",
        "\u2018Hey, they\u2019re shooting at us,\u2019 said Arthur, crouching in a tight ball.",
        "\u2018I thought they said they didn\u2019t want to do that.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I thought they said that,\u2019 agreed Ford.",
        "Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment.",
        "\u2018Hey,\u2019 he said, \u2018I thought you said you didn\u2019t want to shoot us!\u2019 and ducked again.",
        "They waited.",
        "After a moment a voice replied, \u2018It isn\u2019t easy being a cop!\u2019 \u2018What did he say?\u2019 whispered Ford in astonishment.",
        "\u2018He said it isn\u2019t easy being a cop.\u2019 \u2018Well surely that\u2019s his problem, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d have thought so.\u2019 Ford shouted out, \u2018Hey, listen! I think we\u2019ve got enough problems of our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid laying your problems on us as well, I think we\u2019d all find it easier to cope!\u2019 Another pause, and then the loud hailer again.",
        "\u2018Now see here, guy,\u2019 said the voice on the loud hailer, \u2018you\u2019re not dealing with any dumb two bit trigger pumping morons with low hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we\u2019re a couple of intelligent caring guys that you\u2019d probably quite like if you met us socially! I don\u2019t go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space rangers\u2019 bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!\u2019 \u2018And I write novels!\u2019 chimed in the other cop.",
        "\u2018Though I haven\u2019t had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I\u2019m in a meeeean mood!\u2019 Ford\u2019s eyes popped halfway out of their sockets.",
        "\u2018Who are these guys?\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018I think I preferred it when they were shooting.\u2019 \u2018So are you going to come quietly,\u2019 shouted one of the cops again, \u2018or are you going to let us blast you out?\u2019 \u2018Which would you prefer?\u2019 shouted Ford.",
        "A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as bolt after bolt of Kill O Zap hurled itself into the computer bank in front of them.",
        "The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable intensity.",
        "When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness as the echoes die away.",
        "\u2018You still there?\u2019 called one of the cops.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 they called back.",
        "\u2018We didn\u2019t enjoy doing that at all,\u2019 shouted the other cop.",
        "\u2018We could tell,\u2019 shouted Ford.",
        "\u2018Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 shouted back Zaphod.",
        "\u2018Because,\u2019 shouted the cop, \u2018it\u2019s going to be very intelligent, and quite interesting and humane! Now \u2013 either you all give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or two others we noticed on our way out here!\u2019 \u2018But that\u2019s crazy!\u2019 cried Trillian.",
        "\u2018You wouldn\u2019t do that!\u2019 \u2018Oh yes we would,\u2019 shouted the cop, \u2018wouldn\u2019t we?\u2019 he asked the other one.",
        "\u2018Oh yes, we\u2019d have to, no question,\u2019 the other one called back.",
        "\u2018But why?\u2019 demanded Trillian.",
        "\u2018Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and everything!\u2019 \u2018I just don\u2019t believe these guys,\u2019 muttered Ford, shaking his head.",
        "One cop shouted to the other, \u2018Shall we shoot them again for a bit?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, why not?\u2019 They let fly another electric barrage.",
        "The heat and noise were quite fantastic.",
        "Slowly the computer bank was beginning to disintegrate.",
        "The front had almost all melted away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way back towards where they were squatting.",
        "They huddled further back and waited for the end.",
        "33 But the end never came, at least not then.",
        "Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and thuds.",
        "The four stared at each other.",
        "\u2018What happened?\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018They stopped,\u2019 said Zaphod with a shrug.",
        "\u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 They waited.",
        "\u2018Hello?\u2019 called out Ford.",
        "No answer.",
        "\u2018That\u2019s odd.\u2019 \u2018Perhaps it\u2019s a trap.\u2019 \u2018They haven\u2019t the wit.\u2019 \u2018What were those thuds?\u2019 \u2018Dunno.\u2019 They waited for a few more seconds.",
        "\u2018Right,\u2019 said Ford, \u2018I\u2019m going to have a look.\u2019 He glanced round at the others.",
        "\u2018Is no one going to say, No you can\u2019t possibly, let me go instead?\u2019 They all shook their heads.",
        "\u2018Oh well,\u2019 he said, and stood up.",
        "For a moment, nothing happened.",
        "Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen.",
        "Ford peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the burning computer.",
        "Cautiously he stepped out into the open.",
        "Still nothing happened.",
        "Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the space suited figure of one of the cops.",
        "He was lying in a crumpled heap on the ground.",
        "Twenty yards in the other direction lay the second man.",
        "No one else was anywhere to be seen.",
        "This struck Ford as being extremely odd.",
        "Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one.",
        "The body lay reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the Kill O Zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers.",
        "He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance.",
        "The cop was quite clearly dead.",
        "A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa \u2013 he was a methane breathing life form, dependent on his space suit for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea.",
        "The tiny life support system computer on his backpack appeared unexpectedly to have blown up.",
        "Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment.",
        "These miniature suit computers usually had the full back up of the main computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked through the subetha.",
        "Such a system was fail safe in all circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was unheard of.",
        "He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably simultaneously.",
        "He called the others over to look.",
        "They came, shared his astonishment, but not his curiosity.",
        "\u2018Let\u2019s get shot of this hole,\u2019 said Zaphod.",
        "\u2018If whatever I\u2019m supposed to be looking for is here, I don\u2019t want it.\u2019 He grabbed the second Kill O Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by the others.",
        "He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that stood waiting for them a few yards away.",
        "The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to Slartibartfast.",
        "It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument panel.",
        "The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the controls.",
        "It said This is probably the best button to press.",
        "34 The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that led out on to the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight.",
        "Ghastly grey light congealed on the land.",
        "R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late.",
        "It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor.",
        "Unless handled with tranquillity this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death.",
        "R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.",
        "The aircar flung itself through the air at R17 and above, deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come, presumably on important business of its own.",
        "Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship.",
        "Beside it stood another one.",
        "It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike affair, slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness.",
        "The letters informed anyone who cared to read them where the ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and where the power feeds should be connected.",
        "It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship whose two man crew was at that moment lying asphyxiated in a smoke filled chamber several miles beneath the ground.",
        "It is one of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define, but one can sense when a ship is completely dead.",
        "Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious \u2013 a ship and two policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead.",
        "In his experience the Universe simply didn\u2019t work like that.",
        "The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity.",
        "Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship.",
        "As he walked, he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in the cold dust.",
        "\u2018Marvin!\u2019 he exclaimed.",
        "\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t feel you have to take any notice of me, please,\u2019 came a muffled drone.",
        "\u2018But how are you, metalman?\u2019 said Ford.",
        "\u2018Very depressed.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Marvin, \u2018I\u2019ve never been there.\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, \u2018are you lying face down in the dust?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a very effective way of being wretched,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018Don\u2019t pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me.\u2019 \u2018No I don\u2019t.\u2019 \u2018Yes you do, everybody does.",
        "It\u2019s part of the shape of the Universe.",
        "I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me.",
        "Even robots hate me.",
        "If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away.\u2019 He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the opposite direction.",
        "\u2018That ship hated me,\u2019 he said dejectedly, indicating the policecraft.",
        "\u2018That ship?\u2019 said Ford in sudden excitement.",
        "\u2018What happened to it? Do you know?\u2019 \u2018It hated me because I talked to it.\u2019 \u2018You talked to it?\u2019 exclaimed Ford.",
        "\u2018What do you mean, you talked to it?\u2019 \u2018Simple.",
        "I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed.",
        "I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,\u2019 said Marvin.",
        "\u2018And what happened?\u2019 pressed Ford.",
        "\u2018It committed suicide,\u2019 said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold.",
        "35 That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brains into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford\u2019s copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy.",
        "Since he was going to have to live in the place, he reasoned, he\u2019d better start finding out something about it.",
        "He came across this entry.",
        "It said: \u2018The history of every major galactic civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Enquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.",
        "\u2018For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question How can we eat?, the second by the question Why do we eat?, and the third by the question Where shall we have lunch?\u2019 He got no further before the ship\u2019s intercom buzzed into life.",
        "\u2018Hey, Earthman? You hungry, kid?\u2019 said Zaphod\u2019s voice.",
        "\u2018Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018OK, baby, hold tight,\u2019 said Zaphod.",

        "An extract follows here from THE RESTAURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE 1 The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created.",
        "This had made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.",
        "Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle Six believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.",
        "The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.",
        "However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle Six and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought.",
        "For instance, a race of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.",
        "For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty two \u2013 and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was.",
        "And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet \u2013 especially by the strange ape like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.",
        "And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense.",
        "Sadly, however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way \u2013 so they claimed \u2013 for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.",
        "Or so it would seem.",
        "Two of these strange, ape like creatures survived.",
        "Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to hitch rides on flying saucers.",
        "Tricia McMillan \u2013 or Trillian \u2013 had skipped the planet six months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the Galaxy.",
        "Two survivors.",
        "They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever conducted \u2013 to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer of Life, the Universe and Everything.",
        "And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship is moving slowly towards them.",
        "2 Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much designed as congealed.",
        "The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices which protruded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly impossible.",
        "Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not by reliable witnesses.",
        "In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would have to go inside it and look at a Vogon.",
        "If you are wise, however, this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born \u2013 or (if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never been born.",
        "In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn\u2019t even think once.",
        "They are simple minded, thick willed, slug brained creatures, and thinking is not really something they are cut out for.",
        "Anatomical analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver.",
        "The fairest thing you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like, and what they like generally involves hurting people and, wherever possible, getting very angry.",
        "One thing they don\u2019t like is leaving a job unfinished \u2013 particularly this Vogon, and particularly \u2013 for various reasons \u2013 this job.",
        "This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, and he it was who had had the job of demolishing the so called \u2018planet\u2019 Earth.",
        "He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill fitting, slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned.",
        "It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and revolutionary ship ever built.",
        "Aesthetics and technology were closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried books as well.",
        "It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard.",
        "Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex President of the Galaxy, and though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not interested.",
        "He had other fish to fry.",
        "It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds, and this was certainly true in his case.",
        "When he heard the words \u2018integrity\u2019 or \u2018moral rectitude\u2019 he reached for his dictionary, and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he reached for the rule book and threw it away.",
        "In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call of his professional duty.",
        "There was even some doubt as to whether the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter had been glossed over.",
        "He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.",
        "\u2018Computer,\u2019 he croaked, \u2018get me my brain care specialist on the line.\u2019 Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light years away from the Vogon face he was looking at.",
        "Mixed up somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too.",
        "Though the Vogon persistently referred to him as \u2018my private brain care specialist\u2019 there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon.",
        "He was paying him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work.",
        "As one of the Galaxy\u2019s most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of psychiatry might be at stake.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how are we feeling today?\u2019 The Vogon Captain told him that in the last few hours he had wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.",
        "Halfrunt\u2019s smile did not flicker for an instant.",
        "\u2018Well,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 rumbled the Vogon, \u2018is what you always say.\u2019 \u2018Well again,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist.",
        "Good.",
        "We are clearly both very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today.",
        "Now tell me, what news of the mission?\u2019 \u2018We have located the ship.\u2019 \u2018Wonderful,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018wonderful! And the occupants?\u2019 \u2018The Earthman is there.\u2019 \u2018Excellent! And...?\u2019 \u2018A female from the same planet.",
        "They are the last.\u2019 \u2018Good, good,\u2019 beamed Halfrunt.",
        "\u2018Who else?\u2019 \u2018The man Prefect.\u2019 \u2018Yes?\u2019 \u2018And Zaphod Beeblebrox.\u2019 For an instant Halfrunt\u2019s smile flickered.",
        "\u2018Ah yes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I had been expecting this.",
        "It is most regrettable.\u2019 \u2018A personal friend?\u2019 enquired the Vogon, who had heard the expression somewhere once and decided to try it out.",
        "\u2018Ah, no,\u2019 said Halfrunt, \u2018in my profession, you know, we do not make personal friends.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 grunted the Vogon, \u2018professional detachment.\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Halfrunt cheerfully \u2018we just don\u2019t have the knack.\u2019 He paused.",
        "His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned slightly.",
        "\u2018But Beeblebrox, you know,\u2019 he said, \u2018he is one of my most profitable clients.",
        "He has personality problems beyond the dreams of analysts.\u2019 He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing it.",
        "\u2018Still,\u2019 he said, \u2018you are ready for your task?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018Good.",
        "Destroy the ship immediately.\u2019 \u2018What about Beeblebrox?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said Halfrunt brightly, \u2018Zaphod\u2019s just this guy, you know?\u2019 He vanished from the screen.",
        "The Vogon captain pressed a communicator button which connected him with the remains of his crew.",
        "\u2018Attack,\u2019 he said.",
        "At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin swearing very loudly.",
        "Two hours ago, he had said that they would go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship\u2019s computer and stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the Improbability factors with a pencil.",
        "The Heart of Gold\u2019s Improbability Drive made it the most powerful and unpredictable ship in existence.",
        "There was nothing it couldn\u2019t do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.",
        "He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching it.",
        "He didn\u2019t know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he liked it.",
        "He didn\u2019t know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except that it seemed a fun thing to be.",
        "He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.",
        "He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.",
        "At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time.",
        "He had run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.",
        "\u2018Starpox!\u2019 he shouted.",
        "At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air.",
        "This was not because of anything wrong with the ship\u2019s artificial gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stairwell which led to the ship\u2019s personal cabins.",
        "It was a very high jump to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered, raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod\u2019s door and explained what was on his mind.",
        "\u2018Vogons,\u2019 he said.",
        "A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin in search of a cup of tea.",
        "It was not a quest he embarked upon with a great deal of optimism, because he knew that the only source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation.",
        "It was called a Nutri Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered it before.",
        "It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared to use it.",
        "When put to the test, however, it invariably produced a plastic cup filled with a liquid which was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
        "He attempted to reason with the thing.",
        "\u2018Tea,\u2019 he said.",
        "\u2018Share and Enjoy,\u2019 the machine repeated and produced another one.",
        "\u2018Share and Enjoy\u2019 is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years.",
        "The motto stands \u2013 or rather stood \u2013 in three mile high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadraz.",
        "Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young complaints executives \u2013 now deceased.",
        "The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read \u2018Go stick your head in a pig\u2019, and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.",
        "Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.",
        "\u2018Listen, you machine,\u2019 he said, \u2018you claim you can synthesize any drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same undrinkable stuff?\u2019 \u2018Nutrition and pleasurable sense data,\u2019 burbled the machine.",
        "\u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018It tastes filthy!\u2019 \u2018If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink,\u2019 continued the machine, \u2018why not share it with your friends?\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 said Arthur tartly, \u2018I want to keep them.",
        "Will you try to comprehend what I\u2019m telling you? That drink...\u2019 \u2018That drink,\u2019 said the machine sweetly, \u2018was individually tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and pleasure.\u2019 \u2018Ah,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018so I\u2019m a masochist on a diet, am I?\u2019 \u2018Share and Enjoy.\u2019 \u2018Oh shut up.\u2019 \u2018Will that be all?\u2019 Arthur decided to give up.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 he said.",
        "Then he decided he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d give up.",
        "\u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018look, it\u2019s very, very simple...",
        "all I want...",
        "is a cup of tea.",
        "You are going to make one for me.",
        "Keep quiet and listen.\u2019 And he sat.",
        "He told the Nutri Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon.",
        "He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun.",
        "He told it about silver teapots.",
        "He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn.",
        "He told it about putting in the milk before the tea so it wouldn\u2019t get scalded.",
        "He even told it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.",
        "\u2018So that\u2019s it, is it?\u2019 said the Nutri Matic when he had finished.",
        "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Arthur, \u2018that is what I want.\u2019 \u2018You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?\u2019 \u2018Er, yes.",
        "With milk.\u2019 \u2018Squirted out of a cow?\u2019 \u2018Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose...\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m going to need some help with this one,\u2019 said the machine tersely.",
        "All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice and it now meant business.",
        "\u2018Well, anything I can do,\u2019 said Arthur.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ve done quite enough,\u2019 the Nutri Matic informed him.",
        "It summoned up the ship\u2019s computer.",
        "\u2018Hi there!\u2019 said the ship\u2019s computer.",
        "The Nutri Matic explained about tea to the ship\u2019s computer.",
        "The computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri Matic and together they lapsed into a grim silence.",
        "Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further happened.",
        "He thumped it, but still nothing happened.",
        "Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.",
        "In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still.",
        "Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy.",
        "Towards it crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.",
